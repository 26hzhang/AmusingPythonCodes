## MNIST Dataset Training Examples
This folder contains several iPython notebooks and pythong codes.

1. Simple MNIST classification with logistic regression. It's a practice to learn the MNIST dataset and use a simple regressor to classify the dataset.
2. MNIST Training, saving and loading model. It's a practice to learn how to save and load models trained by tensorflow. Reference: [10_save_restore_net.py](https://github.com/nlintz/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/10_save_restore_net.py).
3. Visualize training process. A practice to learn how to visualize the training process with tensorboard. Reference: [mnist_with_summaries.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/mnist/mnist_with_summaries.py).
4. Train MNIST dataset via CNN. A simple convolutional neural networks example to deal with a classification tasks. Reference: [05_convolutional_net.py](https://github.com/nlintz/TensorFlow-Tutorials/blob/master/05_convolutional_net.py).
5. Train MNIST dataset via RNN. A simple recurrent neural networks example to train MNIST dataset. Reference: [recurrent_network.py](https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/examples/3_NeuralNetworks/recurrent_network.py), [Supervised Sequence Labelling with Recurrent Neural Networks](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/preprint.pdf).
6. Train MNIST with autoencoder. An example of unsupervised learning. Reference: [Autoencoders and Sparsity](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Autoencoders_and_Sparsity).
7. Train MNIST to explore the effect of training epochs for losses in training dataset and in validation dataset. (Deep Learning Book P152 Figure)
