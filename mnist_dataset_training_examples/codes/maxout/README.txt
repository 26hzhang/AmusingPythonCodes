## How to run the MNIST experiment?

```
# make sure Tensorflow is installed.
git clone git@github.com:philipperemy/tensorflow-maxout.git maxout
cd maxout
python mnist_maxout_example.py MAXOUT # Can pick up from one of those values: LINEAR, RELU, MAXOUT.
```

## How to integrate it in your code

It's two lines of code. Sorry I can't make it shorter.

```
from maxout import max_out
t = max_out(tf.matmul(x, W1) + b1, num_units=50)
```

# Some Results on MNIST dataset

Those results are not meant to reproduce the results of the paper. It's more about showing on how to use the maxout non linearity in the Tensorflow graphs.

## Loss

As expected, Maxout strictly outperforms Sigmoid and ReLU. Having one hidden layer + non linearity helps to have a smaller loss.
