This repository are inspired by [suriyadeepan/rnn-from-scratch](https://github.com/suriyadeepan/rnn-from-scratch), most codes in this repository is borrowed from this original project. The author also wrote two useful and easily understandable posts ([Unfolding RNNs](http://suriyadeepan.github.io/2017-01-07-unfolding-rnn/) and [Unfolding RNNs II](http://suriyadeepan.github.io/2017-02-13-unfolding-rnn-2/)) to teach how to build RNN (vanilla, lstm, gru) models using tensorflow from scratch.

In this repository, I changed a lot codes structure as well as the some codes to make them more readable and fit to train on tensorflow `1.0.0` (original repo is trained on tensorflow `0.12.0`).
