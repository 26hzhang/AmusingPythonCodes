Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night?
Well, there's someone I think might be --
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
What crap?
No
I hope so.
Who?
I don't have to be home 'til two.
Queen Harry?
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Hi, Joey.
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
It's just you.
You're not going unless your sister goes.  End of story.
Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you?
So they tell me...
Thirty-two.
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse.  They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
He seems like he thrives on danger
Like we had a choice?  Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
It's her favorite band.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
I don ' t know.  I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Away.
Are you lost?
We're not.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Does it matter?
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Who?
Oh, right.  Friday.
I told you
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
Look up, sunshine
Forget it.  I'm stayin'.
Something like that
It's Scurvy's.  His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
Oh huh
Because you're making decisions for me.
So what I want doesn't matter?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
Just smack her now.
Yeah.  I guess.
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
Touch of the flu.
What's to discuss?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
Dr. Ruth?
Ah, leave him alone.  He's doing no harm.
Your life, and that of others!
Well... that's true.  I have a child by a man who won't marry me!  Who's always leaving...
I'd love to argue with you sometimes.  But you're never here!
I find that hard to believe.
They tried... but I didn't let them.
I am busy inside.
He asks when he can come to visit you.  He left his address.
I'm not bargaining!
... for a commoner?
Look out of that window.
What is it?  A tribe?  An island?
Tell the Chief we thank him.
He understands.
To open a new route to Asia.  At the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...
Ignorance!  I believe the Indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the Canary Islands.
I've been contradicted all my life... Eternity!
Damn God!
Father, I have betrayed my family. I betrayed my men.  And I betrayed you.
If I tell them, they won't follow me.  You know that I am right, Father.  You trust me...
Give me absolution.
Oh?  So you are a new man?
No more than the woman who said she would take Granada from the Moors.
What did they say about Granada before today?
Surely you can do anything you want.
They come and go as naked as the day God created them...
My horse doesn't work.
Never, Your Majesty.  Although...
Yes.  It would be a pity, wouldn't it?  Call him back!
Is this true, Brother Buyl?
Where are we going?
What about Oleg?
What about my movie rights?  Book rights?
Give me another one, please.
Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out?
Divorced.
So...the station is empty?
Yes, I considered it.
I'll get my clothes.
...Do you really want me to forget about you?
C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people?
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
It was my decision, not his.
'Cause we got more important things to do, like finding out who did it.
What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot.
But Chief?  Over this??
Vodka tonic.
It's okay.
Yeah.
Police.  We'd like to ask you a few questions.
He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly!
No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon?
Nah, why should you?
Pretty.
Maybe you don't care about that either.  Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile.
Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary?
I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already.
Of course.
Something back home?
You're her Savior?  Is she the kid you're gonna save from the burning building?
Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me.
What do you want?
What's your accomplishment.
If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck.
I really can't give out any information right now at this point.
Yeah.  Now's not a good time.
I'm not.
You're ruthless.
See you later.  Good luck.
Don't be late.
Jesus Christ.
I'm not moody.
Keep them out of my way.
No.  Are you proposing?
What?  It doesn't work that way.
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.
You'll be my first.
Two weeks holiday.
Is there a problem?
Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview?
Okay.
Whatever we do - we fuck her, right?
Cut!
Did you hurt her?
Milos.  Get my money!
You want the tape?  There it is!
Of course he's moody.  He thinks he's in love.
Paulie, you've got kids, right?
This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him.
Yes, we're in New York now.  But where are you planning to stay in New York?
Excuse me?
Look, I don't have time for you, get out of my way!!
A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights!
Hey, by the way, I'm really sorry about your wife leavin' you.
Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian?
Well, how nice to see you again, Elena. You're looking wonderful.
I'm sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I'm really not at liberty to discuss this.
Okay, come on down.
I guess it isn't.
Yes, I don't know what to make of it.
Well... Hal's reported the AO-unit about to fail again.
I understand Hal. We'll take care of it. Please, let me have the hard copy.
Yes, I know that. But I can assure you that they were about to fail.
Yes, it is, Hal.
It doesn't have to be, Hal. It's more dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control, please.
Hal, switch to manual hibernation control.
I know that you've had that on your mind for some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.
Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got mine about the same time.
Did they have any explanation for this?
In three days, darling, I hope.
She's in the bathroom.
How many days until you come home?
Thank you, Daddy.
I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or later.
Thank you. It's been a great pleasure to meet all of you... Dr. Smyslov.
Yes, very pleasant.
I suppose you saw the work on our new section while you were docking.
Are you quite sure?
Are you, by any chance, going up to your base at Clavius?
You mean you haven't been able to get anyone at the base for ten days?
Yes... Well, I hope the crew got back safely.
Certainly.
Dr. Smyslov... I'm not permitted to discuss this.
How can you tell it was deliberately buried?
I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that?
Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
There is no other purpose for this mission than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?
Hammond.
Great, just great.
Try obeyin' the law once in awhile, and I won't have to hassle you...
Yeah, dummy.  Money.
Just do what I say, okay? We'll pay for the girls and have a good time... Don't you trust me?
And I need one more for my pal. Yeah. Make her an Indian. No, not a turban, you know, a squaw.
Excuse me, baby, but if i don't get some action tonight, I'm gonna bust.  You interested?
Here you go sweetheart, throw it my way.
Here's hoping, baby...
I just struck it rich... I think we can do a little business.  As a matter of fact, I think we can have a party.
What are you talking about? We didn't kill her ...
Listen, it may be a little out of date. You know, I got a reputation for lookingreal sharp with the ladies...
You got a girl... shit... the generosityof women never ceases to amaze me.
You just don't get it, do your Reggie?  There isn't any deal. I own your ass.
Then what're you complainin' about? At least nobody's calling you shithead....
I'm helpin' you, huh?
Do you know how close I was to getting some trim.  And you fucked' it up.
It's a long shot, but...Billy used to tend bar here a few years back. I heard him talk about it.
I don't know what you're talking about. I just wanna see Ganz nailed.
Must be billy's girl.
I wasn't sure the money was still there until we saw Luther. You almost got your ass shot off for nothing once, not twice, Jack.
Not really.  I figured Ganz was put down for a long time.  And I knew Luther would never job me on his own.  He's too chickenshit.
I'm not in this 'cause it's fun. I'm not into hitting guys 'cause it makes me feel good either... I do it 'cause it works-...
Class isn't somethin' you buy, punk. Look at you, five hundred dollar suit and you're still a lowlife.
I'll be there in a minute. You don't move your ass, right?
What about Ganz?
You missed ... Luther took a taxi to the hotel across the street. Made a phone call.
You sure that's the reason?
I can just take her right across the street to Luther's hotel.  All I need is some money for the room.
I had it impounded.  Come on, we'll use it for haulin' you back to the slam.
Whatever play I maker just back me up.
Partnership?
Spare met Jack. I'm into legit investments from here on in.
Anthing botherin' you besides losin' your gun?
Jack?
I lost them, that's what happened.
I didn't have the time.
I'm taking my prisoner back to jail.
Are you gonna tell me about police procedure?  Do me a favor, don't give me a bunch of crap.
I'm heading out. How about you?
This is a .44 Magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world. You gotta ask yourself just one question. Are you feelin' lucky?
You're hopeless.
I guess he got the message...
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
I didn't get burned, two cops did. Listen, I'll tell you about personnel responsibility.  I like to get the job done right.  And if I don't get my job done right... I'm for shit.
Hiya, kid.
Come on, they were a little old for a slumber party.
So what?
Hey, Come on, shrink time's over. They wouldn't go see some old girlfriend.
Where is he?
Yeah, old times.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
First, the money.
Naw, right here's okay.
It's loaded... I got some shells in here.
Five bills.
This ain't a credit business.
Napoleon... small.
I'm fucked!
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
So you do know her.
She's an exception..
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
What kind of mission?
This is government business now. You ought to go home and get some rest, Father.
What is?
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Perfect.
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
They are... with me...
Hey bud...I'm waiting all day here.
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
We will be ready, Lord.
You're the nastiest dirtbag I know in this stinking City!
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
Thanks for reminding me..
This is a police control action..
He's on vacation.
Not without Leeloo.
What mission?
Old tricks are the best tricks eh?
What is it?
Three of us will never fit in there!
Uh..you're welcome.
All 900.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
Apipoussan!
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
OK, you can turn around!
...The rain falls...
Exactly.
I love you...
Been here long?
You gotta push the little yellow button...
Actually only one cell survived..
It's an honor to receive you. Mr. President.
How much time is left?
Perfect, Mr. President.
There are no results from the chemical and molecular analysis as of yet, all the calibers are overshot..we're hoping a thermo nucleatic imaging..
Recommendations.
Only too well... here you must be parched..
To fame.. salud..
Yes, Mr. Zorg, I hear you perfectly! So, how was the concert?
Yes, Sir!
Right away, Sir. I'll send you a new one to the hotel.
Fine, just fine!  I'll have the 4 pieces you asked for any time now.  But it wasn't easy. My costs have tripled.
...I can't wait to be among you.
Smoking?  I'm not smoking.
Well, I'm not smoking, okay?
What's wrong?  Are you alright?
I'm okay, honey, I'm okay.  Are you alright?
I don't know what to say
Amy...
There's nothing harder.
What can I do for you today?
Yes.  What we're looking for is rather specific.
Where are the women?
How cooperative.  Longdale will keep you company.
What I'd like, very simply, is access to your archive.  And, now I understand this isn't something you normally do for private citizens...
We do.
Well, that's all I can do.  Sorry.
Eddie.
I know what you did.
I know what you did.
Nobody saw you bring her in?
Stop talking.
Show me where you buried her.
Don't think I won't.
I had three jerkoffs trying to return your tapes last month.  Do you know how bad a skin flick has to be for some jackass to come back into my place with a fucking receipt, and try to fucking return it?
None of this would be happening if you would have left it alone.  If you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago.  A girl no one even remembers.
Shut your mouth and drive!
Fuck you.
Go ahead, shoot me.  Then try driving to Brooklyn with my brains all over the windshield.
Yeah... guess so.
Catchy title.  What are you really reading?  Hard to believe that book's got any parts worth highlighting.
Might get drummed out of the pornographer's union, and then where would I be?
Three, four years.
Max.
From Pennsylvania.  P.I. from PA. What are you doing out here?
Tomorrow night, I get off at eight.
Wake up, pops.  Your education begins tonight.
I don't know, where are yours?
I'm not mixed up in anything, hayseed.  What are you talking about?
I see a ring on your finger.  You have any kids?
A weirdo making S+M films?  Who'd have thought it?
Where does he sell it?
Who is this, in the mask?  Who is he?
"Devil" frightened me as much as it excited me, but I'd be hard pressed to choose a favorite.
Nope.
I try to be.
I'll do whatever I can to help.
Mostly.  That's where he started his empire building.  He was a good man.  Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated.  He wanted to be legendary.
We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine.  We had our troubles.  There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him.  I loved him deeply.
I know what I'm asking.  Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk.  You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it.  I feel responsible, Mr. Welles.  You saw what he did to her.
You're joking.
I'm here.
Yes, but...
Neil... Neil Cole.
No.
They hired you.  You're like, a private detective?
We were divorced by then.  Things fell apart... he was living with a friend...
What?
It's been six years.
Mrs. Mathews?  It's Thomas.  Do you remember, I was there a few weeks ago... asking about your daughter...
I'm trying to find out.  She was a runaway.  I'm looking into it for her parents.
He's an imbecile.  I tried to warn my daughter, but what can you do?
Excellent.  we accept MasterCard and American Express.
What?
Figure it out?!?!  I'll be insane before I figure it out.  The only thing I'm sure of is that I can't go to sleep.  Not while he's using me.
Maybe you shouldn't be working here so much.  You don't want to get stuck waiting tables for the rest of your life.
Who?
Hey, you're not alone.  We have to stop him, I'm with you.
Give her time.  Beauty is skin deep.
It was Freddy.
She told us the story of Freddy.  It's a town legend.  He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
Well Mom, I'll tell ya, when two of your friends die the same day, you let me know what it does to your appetite.
Oh God!  He killed them!
You're not taking my baby!
No...
Who said I...wait, what?
He's inside you, where he hides.
He says it's easy.  Especially with sad people.  With closed-off people.
Jesus!  Don't do that!
They're coach seats, but the plane lands in Paris.  It's gonna be a helluva summer, hon!
To take a picture.
Sobering...
I've got to go.
But Dad --
They're waiting for us...but let's keep this dream stuff between you and me.
When Dan died you weren't even asleep. You said so.  End of story.
That's the only reason you're alive...
Yeah...So that's him.  And you're not crazy.
If they actually bothered to bury her.
So did Dan.
Well we gotta do something!
It wasn't her mother.  The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.
That's their problem.
That's what the newspapers thought.  She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.
Two hours a day, six days a week.
Stick around, please?
He invited me to his house last night.
It was supposed to be.  Dad had a heart attack, two days ago.
Your father can be in Nome, Alaska, tomorrow.  We have two choices: Ask them to send him out in a 'copter', and take you off, or the Shark can put back into Nome...
We're <u>all</u> risking our lives!
But Julie's a nice girl, and I've seen you work.  She deserves a fighting chance!
Strange you didn't hear it. OMIT 274F
Something wrong?
What????
What about time...?
<u>We</u> harness energy on a small scale by cutting magnetic lines of force.  Maybe Cyclops does it on a <u>super</u> scale....
As ready as we <u>can</u> be!  I'll report to the Skipper.
What?
That's why no water leaked inside when we rammed you?
Toward the Pole!
Alma, I think there's some dirty business going on in this town.
Twombley involved?
He can't fire me. LaRiviere already did that this morning.
How soon?
Nope. Heard it. We wasn't far apart. I spotted this buck, then I heard the gun go off and Twombley was gone. I looked over the little cliff we was using for a stand and there the fucker was, deader'n shit. Called it right in.
Not exactly. I mean, he never paid me.
You can't buy Wade off.
Tell you what. You get me close to a big buck by ten, kid, there's another hundred bucks in it.
You understand what I'm saying? I want a deer, a dead one, not a cripple or whatthefuck.
And you'll get your extra hundred bucks.
Oh.
Sun's gettin high.
Got you for -- 450, 500 bucks? 
A half mile in, along the old lumber road.
What blood?
Let's get the fuck outta here. You're not making any sense, man.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
I don't care. They're out.
Do what?
No.
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Yes.
Yes.
Yeah. My car's in the shop. This'll be fine.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
Nothing.
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
What am I -- a security guard? You hired me, you and your Selectman friends.
Twombley's shot. I heard that. Not Jack. He's okay, I assume.
Elaine! Call Chub Meritt and have him pick up Wade's car, fix the clutch.
You two, don't you get it? He's using you. You're his slaves.  Jesus Christ, Jack, don't you see that?
Where's Jill?
Where is she now? Is she in the truck with your friends?
We've done all our talking, Wade.
Hi honey.
Did you see that sonofabitch in the BMW? He could've killed somebody.
Yeah. I mean that.
I'm sure, I'm positive it didn't happen the way Jack says it did.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
I've been thinking about it, that's all.
It's my tooth! My fucking tooth! I can't even think anymore because of it.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
It's broke I guess. There's an electric in the bedroom.
How's that?
Jesus Christ. Mr. Gordon, when I come all the way to serve somebody a summons, I don't call ahead for an appointment.
I'm issuing you a ticket. Moving violation.
Fuck. Wade Whitehouse. It's people like you that keep this fucking town from prospering. Whatever somebody does to improve things around here, you gotta find fault with it.
Where... how'd you hear that?
No, I... I've been out on the grader all morning. Twombley's summer people. Massachusetts. Friend of Gordon's. It was his idea for Jack to take him hunting.  I gotta go.
His office. You mean my old office.
From Wickham's. Been a while. Like some coffee?
Come on, smart guy. Tell how it's no big deal. Tell me how a single one of you is worth a single hair on that woman's head.
There was something. It happened up your way.
Huh?
How was she?
Who?
Yeah, I guess.
I get to feeling like a whipped dog some days, Rolfe, and some night I'm going to bite back. I swear it.
What about her?
I care about what happened. The truth. I'm a student of history, remember?
You think I wouldn't remember a thing like that?
We'd have to go digging in Vietnam to ask him.
Well, I never heard that one.
Wade, are you alright?
Take care of the little things first, the things that are distracting you from taking care of the big things. Call Chub Merritt, get your car back, call a dentist, for God's sake, and get your tooth pulled, don't trust the locals, get your facts straight and go straight to the state police. Let them work on this.
You're jet-lagged.  We'll talk about this back...
Some kids were teasing you?
You must be tired. It'll wake you up.
Smart for your age, eh? Top of your class? Tell me, do you know what the word &quot;propaganda&quot; means?
Okay, it's on. We've got some indicator lights here.
cross it...  The static overwhelms the voice, then cuts out.
You read my mind.
I'm doing what I can.
Just stay on my wing, sir. I'll take you all the way in.
Lemme take a look.
Thanks.  Wrote it last night.
Does your office have anything to add, Mr. Dean?
To swear you in as President.
Because it is my duty.
Dead.
Nine.
We checked the manifest. Everyone was accounted for.
Romeo Tango Zulu, copy One the television, graphics of the First Family against the Presidential Seal.
Copy, Air Force One.
Thank you.
How are your fellow hostages feeling, Ms. Mitchell?
Or you will do what, Mrs. Marshall?  But I admire your courage. Your husband, on the other hand...
I know he left you behind.
That was war.
No.
You will be the first to pay for that mistake.
Over my dead body.
You'll do it?
Excuse me?
But...
Don't cut me off. This is an emergency.
No. no. no. Wait. Wait.
I always wondered if my freshman Russian class would come in handy.
I might still have a few chips left.
That's my job.
I never left. Where's my wife and daughter?
Sir...
Accelerators down.
Sir?
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
Ask Simon.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
Let me by, Elaine.
Not now, Elaine!
What word would you use, Elaine?
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine.  I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
Ted, please be careful.
Not now, Elaine.
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Simon.
No, I've been excited before.
Simon, why has he become so... so...
Don't be too long.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Cut the Doubting Thomas shit, Elaine.  I know where I'm coming from on this.
Scraps.
How would you like your eggs, Captain? Over.
A b...
Mr. Kurtz, I presume.
Yes, sir, commander.  This is Mercury One.  Everything seems A- okay up here and ready for count-down.
Thanks, but we have a terrific woman in on Thursdays.
Yes.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
Kurtz, you're drunk.  Who's in command of this ship?
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
Shep, no! He gets so excited when new people are here.
I can't tell.
I'm not sure. I haven't seen anything like this since the Lina Wertmuller Film Festival.
Yes. Yes, of course.
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
But if you'll just give me...
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
Yes, Captain?
Runway niner. It's the longest, and directly into the wind.
Watch your altitude, Striker. It's too erratic. You can't come straight in. You've got enough fuel left for two hours flying. You've got to stay up there 'til we get a break in the weather.
I thought maybe you'd like to hear a song.
Oh yes, I saw. Poor child.
Thank you.
No. No thank you.
The cockpit? What is it?
Would you go up, please?
Does that cost extra or you throw them in?
The girl out front mentioned Strader's assistant, somebody named Watson.  Maybe he knows.
Your voice is saying no, but your body is saying yes.
Jesus, Sykes -- it's been less than ten hours.  Me and Alterez are on it, okay?
No, Sergeant -- not history...  Eternity...
This is becoming a serious breach of security.
The murder at the mini-mart is not our case.  The Captain said--
So the Slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like Hubley worked at a refinery.  I'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.  Okay, next step -- I gotta go talk to the wife of the Slag store owner blown away last night.
Todd Watson.  The assistant manager.
Ta ss'trakyona'...
Yeah, go home.  Get some sleep.  You do sleep, don't you?
George, she's not gonna divorce you. You mate for life, remember?
To the... to the beach?
Like your cocaine, I suppose.  The "high" lasts several hours.  We would receive small amounts of it... as a reward for our labor.
Your people don't know about this part of out past.  And they can't know -- It would threaten our entire existence here.
You understand that.  But how many others will?
You look very good.
The human?
Yeah, I'll bet.
You mean the Blob?  They're finishing up now.
Hey, look -- we've known Kristin since... since she was conceived in that cabin up in Big Bear. Remember?  You and Edie banged the wall so hard, me and Carol were picking plaster out of our hair for a week...
Whatever gave you that idea?
Awright!  I want a nice clean dispersal this time.
Vasquez, take point.  Let's move.
Let's go.  Pull 'em out.
Hard to say.  It may have been blind instinct...attraction to the heat of whatever...but she did choose to incubate her eggs in the one spot where we couldn't destroy her without destroying ourselves.  That's if she exists, of course.
How long until it blows?
What?
Cancer.  Hmmmm.  They still haven't licked that one.  Cremated.  Interred Parkside Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin.  No children.
Look, I believe you, but there are going to be some heavyweights in there.  You got Feds, you got interstellar commerce commission, you got colonial administration, insurance company guys...
Well, the corporation co-financed that colony with the Colonial Administration, against mineral rights.  We're getting into a lot of terraforming...'Building Better Worlds.'
Well, it didn't occur to me.  It's been policy for years to have a synthetic on board.
Uh-hunh.  One of thirty or so, all over the planet.  They're completely automated.  We manufacture them, by the way.
Don't make me pull rank, Ripley.
But they will know about it, Burke. From me.  Just like they'll know how you were responsible for the deaths of one hundred and fifty-seven colonists here --
We're trained to deal with these kinds of situations.
It's insured.
PDT'S.  Personal-Data Transmitters. Every adult colonist had one surgically implanted.
Gorman!  Give it a rest would you.
Sir?
Alive?
You tell me.  I only work here.
Do it!
Let's get these things lit.
On my way.
Can't tell.  Lots.  D gun's down to twenty.  Ten.  It's out.
Get back here, both of you.  Fall back to Operations.
We ain't going anywhere.
Don't be long, Ellen.
Uh, what's next?
How?  The transmitter was on the APC.  It's wasted.
I don't know, an acid hole in a duct.  Something under the floors, not on the plans. I don't know!
Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
Terrible.
No.. I've slept enough.
They're dead.
Oh.  Sorry, Newt.
Look!
Newt, I want you to hang on, now.  Hang on tight.
Yes, honey.  I think we both can.
Then that would be eating and drinking I'd live like a Prince without thinking. The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine! Then that would be eating and drinking! The wisdom of old would be mine - A woman's much better than wine. She's much better than wine! She's much better than wine!
Really? What else did he tell you today? Give me some gossip.
Oh? News travels fast in Vienna.
A brothel.
Don't bother.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
I'm so relieved.
But he needs to be here in Salzburg, Your Grace. He needs me and he needs you. Your protection, your understanding.
Why do I have to be humiliated in front of my guests by one of my own servants?
Dinner? How dare you? I am a nobleman. I only dine with people of my own height.
Oh shut up. I'm sick to death of that tune.
Sra-I'm-sick! Sra-I'm sick!
Em iram! Em iram!
Just say it - you'll see. It's very serious. Em iram!  Em iram!
Ui-vol-i-tub!
Oh, leave me alone.
Well, ask her!
Your father is dead.
Why not? Half the house!
You'd think I was mad.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
What?
I was at hand.
Leave him alone!
Adorable!
Hey!
Ah-ha!
Well, there it is. Now to business. Young man, we are going to commission an opera from you. What do you say?
And the result satisfies.
Of course not.
It is not a question of liking, Your Majesty. Your own law decrees it, I'm afraid.
Really? Oh, grazie, Signore! Sono commosso! E un onore per mo eccezionale. Compositore brilliante e famossissimo!
Of course I do. It's very good. Of course now and then - just now and then - it gets a touch elaborate.
Well, I mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?  How shall one say, Director?
Yes, Sire.
Well, yes, I admit it is.
Well, six or seven minutes! maybe eight!
Well. There it is.
He's here.
Oh, yes. Oh, I mean no - not exactly like this. I mean today - just today, Stanzi - I remember now. She had to go - yes! She had to help her mother. Yes, she's like that. Her mother's a very sweet woman, you'll see.
Composition doesn't pay. You know that.
I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son.
No one calls you that.
Good morning, sir.
Yes, thank you, sir.
Bene.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Can I see it?
Well, we can.
Please. I'll give it back, I promise. Please, sir.
Did you like it, then?
She is well. She is - well, actually, I'm about to become a father! She only told me last night. You are the first to know.
Filled? That's impossible! They haven't even seen my work. I need this post. Please, can't you help me? Please!
Whom did they choose?
I'm afraid not.
Ah, how exciting! Tell me more.
Oh, I could kill him! I mean really kill him. I actually threw the entire opera on the fire, he made me so angry!
Oh no! My wife took it out in time.
Thank you! Oh, thank you.
I wouldn't presume. All the same, if it wouldn't be imposing, I would like you to see my new piece. It would be a tremendous honour for me.
Work fast. And be sure to tell no one what you do. You will see me again soon.
Do you mean that?
I'm too young to be so sick.
Yes.
I think so.
I'm not leaving you.
What for?
In the sight of God that is a sin.
Here in Vienna.
I'm surprised you don't know. It was a very popular tune in its day. I wrote it. How about this?
Ah - you've heard that?
I poisoned his life.
Yes?
Italian?
Yes.
Incredible.
Yes, in the third act.
Show her in. Then go to bed.
Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
No, a cab will be faster.
I dream of death mostly.
Will you come with me?
There is only one bed.
Of course.
I was awake and he was in my room.
I wasn't hallucinating.
A doper werewolf.
See you later.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
No.
No.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
You're going to have to stop this disturbance or I shall arrest you.
This isn't Mr. Goodman's idea. He is your good friend, whereas I am a victim of your carnivorous lunar activities.
Oh, come on, tell us.
Alex?
Do you have bad dreams, too?
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
So they said.
Did you see Jack?
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
It's a five-pointed star.
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
Are you going to help me up?
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
What?!
Nurse!
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
Yes.
How shall I do it?
Oh, that's been there for two hundred years. We were going to paint it out, but it's traditional, so we left it.
But I can heat some up for you if you'd like.
That is precisely my point. David, as far as we are concerned, the matter is closed. We won't trouble you any further. Good day.
No kidding. When I saw it, you could'a knocked me over with a pin.
Matt?
The detectives got Matt up there in Sampson's office.
It was more than that last week.
Here's twenty-five thousand.
Ten bucks? Say, if I had ten bucks, I'd quit.
Where do you think I've been?  I took the baby for a stroll in the park.
Say, don't annoy me. I got troubles of my own.
Yes, sir.
What good will that do?  Why, it will take control away from him. We'll put somebody else in charge, call in all doubtful loans, and be on safe ground again. That's what good it will do!
Of course, yes. Just what would you like to know, Inspector?
Oh yes, of course. There was someone with me. A lady.
Somebody must be in good humor. He was humming "Mother Machree."
Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
I know, I know, Dude. Oh, I must have been crazy! I lost my head completely!
I haven't got it.
All you gotta do is fix a few things for us , and we'll do the rest, see?
You? No, you'll be all right, so long as you establish an alibi for tonight.
Well, you can. You always could.
Don't you know?
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
I'm listening.
Yes.
You can take some of the girls. You can take Mildred - or Gwynn—
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
I haven't got any new stories for them this morning, either.
Where is he now?
Yes, sir.
No, sir.
Why wouldn't you tell me where you were last night?
Good.  You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released.  And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
I'm afraid he's been stalling.
Mine too?
What'll we do?
I hate to do this, but I've got to have time to dig up some help. I think I know where I can get some real cash. Snap into it, Sampson. We will lick this thing yet.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
With what?
Oh, you think I'm lying?
Come here.  You know, a few minutes ago I was in Cluett's office and Mrs. Dickson was there.
I tell you, I saw them!
Yes, right in his office, the rat. I'd like to take a crack at that guy.
Who? Cluett? No, not yet. But I'd like to take a crack at that stiff- necked, horse dollar.[6]
I've been trailing the cashier like you told me. You're right about that guy, chief. There's something screwy somewhere.
Yes, sir.
It couldn't have been earlier?
Then where were you?
Dammit, this stopped being fun about two years ago!
Anywhere nobody's shooting at me is pretty.
What?
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
Hey!
Yes. I am obviously not standing out in people's minds at the robberies.
You're not scared, are you?
After all you did on our farm?  You miss it, don't you Jesse?
So what do we do, General Lee?
Sorry.
Just because he reads all those books and knows all those big words doesn't make him smart.
If you'd read about it first, you'd have no problems.
I got us through the War all right.
Pass me some whisky.
Who's next? You? Me? Bob?
Pff. All we been through, the thought never crossed my mind.
You pay me to find you Bluecoats. There they are.
Must be a garrison in town. We're in occupied territory, boys.
Which one, right or left?
Sadie was not a man!
Strategically.
They gonna rush us?
Where is Jesse James?
The District Marshall
You're right, sir.
I'd appreciate that.
I think he's already feeling better.
No, Jesse, your problem is you're always doing stuff before I'm finished figuring it out.
We better go to Doc's, see what's going on here.
You can shut up now.
Make a thousand of 'em. Still won't be enough by the time I'm through.
Fine. How'd it go out here?
Bob's upset.
I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
They're making him a hero now.
Boys?
What you do to me is unfair. The teasing, I mean.
Unfair. You are completely unfair.
Is this one of Frank's Shakespeare poems you're trying to quote?
Frank and me have to go away for a while.
She's the most wonderful woman in the world. Can't get her out of my mind.
She's beautiful. Smart. And has the biggest... buck teeth in all of Missouri.
What?
I figured.
I'm not hanged yet.
Thanks.
I hope I'm not being too forward.
Lyla Devereux.
They had to be dealt with!
NO! It is NOT my pleasure to have to leave my board room to come to this godforsaken piece of dirt to discover why in the name of all that is holy you cannot seem to evict a few simple farmers from their PATHETIC LITTLE MUDHOLES so that I may build the GREATEST railroad that this country has ever seen!
Yes sir.
A further impediment is that the Army garrison has been ordered to move on from Liberty. We will no longer have that particular stick with which to threaten the farmers.
Sir?
What, sir?
Oh, that. I'll let Jenkins explain.
I'm losing millions of dollars and months of time while you play chess with these farmers!
I can't believe this.
Pumpkin?
Pumpkin you're dating an asshole.
The question is do you like it, Courtney? And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a boyfriend to eat there tonight.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
What do you want, Courtney?
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe.
You and...Luis?
I'm not supposed to.  But I can make an exception.
Do...what.
Evelyn?
I don't want to talk about it.
My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs.
We never really shared one.
Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality.
Is that all you ever have to contribute, Van Patten? "What about fucking dinner?"
Yes, naturally.
What exactly do you mean?
But wait, Harold, what do you mean?
No! Listen, don't you know who I am? I'm not Davis, I'm Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time! Don't you recognize me? You're my lawyer.
It's just not.
No, Luis. It's not me. You're mistaken.
Commes des Garcon.
Jesus lives, Luis.
Where are you going?
It looks that way, doesn't it?
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.
Ask me a question.
Leaving what?
I'm just a happy camper. Rockin' and a-rollin'. VAN PATTEN  Rehab's done wonders for you, pal. Working for UNICEF now?
Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?
When?
No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay?
Come on, you're prettier than that.
Patrick?
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL, please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.
Yes, Patrick?
No, come on. Anywhere you want.
You didn't give them a name.
No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
Jean? Hello? Jean?
Hello? Jean, I need help!
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
No. Flattering, but no.
That's...that's too bad.
What?
No.
I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.
So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-
No. I'm okay.
Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-
It's no problem
Harvard. The Harvard Business School.
Thanks.
Who do you ask?
No, I guess it's okay.
What do you mean...Yale thing?
He led what I suppose was an orderly life. He... ate a balanced diet.
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.
No. Not really.
Hang...out?
No, he just hung out there.
I just wanted to know if you know. BATEMAN Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint Paul's... Listen, I just...I just want to help.
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure. But... basically no one has seen or heard anything.
Eerie. Really eerie.
Oh really? I didn't know that.
Absolutely, I'm 100% with you.
Great, yes, I'd like that.
Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations.
And?
Marcus?
I checked it out. It's clean.
Al.
Oh yes. I'm very lucky.
Yes, Owen?
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.
'Gonna wait outside.
"Make" him?
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
If he's really a bully, he won't cop to it, anyway.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
Teddy was killed last night.
I don't know! I just know it was Teddy's code. All these ideas flying in from everywhere. You know how he says "Any kid working in his garage can put us out of business?" It's like they know what every kid's doing.
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post?  And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
...Whaddo I do?
...Different?
Yeah. Hi. Thank you for seeing me.
You can't pre-empt Yoga, that's our biggest show.
What'd they ever do for you?
Wanna be a part of history?
Is it your dish?
Outpost was his baby, sure. On the other hand, we just learned Gary Boyd owns the Skywire satellites. Personally.
We tried!
He just likes to write code. He's bummed there's so much secrecy and competition, everybody trying to own everything.
It needs a more object-oriented language. This doesn't scale, does it?
What're you implying.
I'm sure.
It helps. Alice said it would help. To focus on something.  'Don't know what I'd do without her.
I'm not much good at handwriting. Or parties.
You see what's hanging on the wall?
'Start-up not 50 miles from here. Kid's on Prozac.
Nothing does. Still. I want him to like me.
Gary, don't worry, we --
Let's go.
You are naive. Look at your employment contract: you can't work anywhere else in this field for at least few years.  Not that I don't miss you.
Got out of my other commitment.
Unlikely. All 14 cameras are frozen. Do we call Randy and Phil? Tell 'em there may have been a break-in?
Keep looking.
Let's get him in here.
They know. 'Just they don't trust me with it. So we'll get the evidence, first, ask questions later.
Where we going?
I launched Skywire. Just pray the last set of coordinates Milo sent me connected us to Gary's satellite.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
...Something like that. Yeah.
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Then and now.  But not right now.
She saved my life.
Hmm?
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
But they'd still get the idea, right?
Before they kill somebody else, too.
You mean -- break in?
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
Perfect.  How am I gonna get away from the party long enough to --
At this point the worst thing I could do is anything out of the ordinary.
Let's try #2.
And your phone messages. You wanna do what you do, it's not a crime.
Uh. Not exactly.
What?!
What d'you mean?
I could get it out of him.
Mmmm... I feel extreme relaxation.
That's very clever. Do you know any other poems?
Thank you, that's beautiful. To your health.
If you can become famous, everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame, man.
Good luck, Austin.
Oh, and Austin...
Be careful.
A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin. The cold war's over.
What?
Damn it, man! You're talking about my mother!
Yes, Basil?
Hey, Mick!
Well, you can't always get what you want.
Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin.
Well, as long as people are still having promiscuous sex with many anonymous partners without protection, while at the same time experimenting with mind-expanding drugs in a consequence-free environment, I'll be sound as a pound.
If it's a lie, goddamn her. It it's the truth, goddamn me.  God, I hope that's witty. How's your mum?
I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector. I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country. It's very boring. My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi. If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative...
We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive.
Sure.
I'm sure.
Do you want to talk to him?
Why?
Indeed.
Shut up.
Likewise.
That's not mine.
I don't even know what this is. This sort of thing ain't my bag, baby.
Hey, wait a minute--
In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir. He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices.
Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept?
Yes.
These are the latest word in android replicant technology.  Lethal, efficient, brutal. And no man can resist their charms. Send in the soldiers!
Dr. Evil?
They're mutated sea bass.
Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away!
I have a gun in my room. Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out.
I don't want to.
Gentlemen, I have a plan. It's called blackmail. The Royal Family of Britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. Either the Royal Family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.
Oh, God no, I made him sleep on the couch.
Shame. I was recommended. By a friend.
Seriously?
There are limits?
... bottle ...
Black...
... preserve...
... love ...
Promised? Who promised?
Sir August...?  What now?
Mr. John Steed, please.
We have met ...
This isn't a game.
Hmmm ...
Let me guess -- 'Father'?
Quite frankly ... it could have been you.
Too many cooks --
And you must be Steed. Please don't get up.
So what was all this -- some sort of test?
And now that we've settled the matter of honorifics, will you kindly explain why you wished me to meet you?
We're not here to talk about the weather, surely.
Do you really think so?
An eccentric recluse?
June, July ... August?
Small talk.  Try the weather.
Did he say who?
Very good, Steed ...
Is there anything that isn't?
Filling in mother nature's blind spots ... ?
But if someone miniaturized the process...
Sounds as if someone's hijacked your research.
... And by you, Mrs. Peel ...
Mrs. Peel ... ?
I expect that's for you to know and me to find out ...
I could be convinced, if ... I knew who poisoned me in the maze. That kiss ...
Aren't we all, Mrs. Peel?
Winning isn't everything.
After you -- Mrs. Peel ...
... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
'... in a beautiful pea green boat...'
I'm no spy -- where do I fit in?
Mobile HQ. In a blue funk.  Can't take chances. I'm looking after things while he's hiding out ...
Decontamination -- ?
I see.
Peter's brother?  But --
Let me guess:  Wonderland Weather.
I'm going to find out who killed my husband. Will you take these documents to Steed?
Anyone particular in mind?
You're getting yourself into terrible trouble, my son. Weather's turning very nasty -- and so am I.
I feel sure of it.
Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face.
Ugh ...
Check out the other guy's buns.
Women!
Bond... James Bond.
Five thousand dollars.
Oh, come on, just a little.
Ooh, be still, my heart.
The best.
So does Debbie.
Yes I did.
Yes, sir, I am.
Keep me informed.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
I'm going now, Cole.
It looks awful.
What's the matter?
Good...
You better not have too much joy.
Gonna get married...
Can't I just go with you guys?
Your mother's not dead.
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
Yes...
Ilene, Rick promised...
Look, you heard what those hookers said. They were supposed to go to a bachelor party.
I think I screwed that one once.
What are you talking about, asshole?
Gary, you're quite an animal.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Let's have a toast.
What's going on?
This place should have been wall to wall tits by now.
Screw that.
You're a pimp?
Milt?
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
What do you mean, it changes?
I couldn't find any razor blades.
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Good. I think you're an asshole. No, let me correct that, an immature asshole. Which is fine, except you're marrying my daughter and I'm afraid my grandchildren are going to be little assholes.
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
Olivier's in that, right?
C'mon. I insist.
My gift to you.
Got me.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
I don't know.
Be gentle.
Tim, fill out the alarm card.  Clean the pipe poles, wipe down the ladders and hang some hose.
Let me take the lead, Stephen...
It's comin' along... want a beer?
It works.
Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
Hey! You don't know me --
Brian --  -- See ya tonight.
This?
Dad's way? Where did he tell you that? In a fucking seance?
Everybody did.
Maybe I do.  ...What a fuckin' mess, huh?  People can change Brian.
-- What are you doing here?
I'm sorry... I'm sorry I thought... I won't.
C'mon Jennifer, he's just another North-Side jag-off with a mouth.
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Uh huh.
You told Swayzak about our arson lead. It's all over the fucking news.
-- You could have scared the son of a bitch off. We may never bust him now. All for a couple's political points.
-- I work for the city.
I quit two days ago, Brian.
Hey, do I know you?
Who's doing this?
What?
You walked out on this academy six years ago. One week to graduation. You think we forgot that? You think I did?
What are you listening to?
No it couldn't.
"Trychtichlorate is a binary structured --"
What reason?
Yeah? Airtight?
Yeah.
No.
I know, I know, Should'a called. I've been really busy. I joined the fire department.
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
What the hell are we waiting for?
I was ahead of my time.
Brian. He's not doing it right, dad. He never does it right.
And DIE!
Cute.
You've come along a dozen times, Stephen, give your brother a chance. We'll be back in a few minutes.  How 'bout it, sport?
I'll be there.
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
Here we go...
Fixing my roof.
He's going to be a fireman.
Hey, I'm the first one to admit when I'm wrong.
In a fire? Never.  Look, I'm his brother. I care about him, y'know? He was going to get himself killed. Maybe not today, maybe not in a year, but it would've happened. And I couldn't -- I just couldn't...
What's wrong?
McCaffrey, hold this for us.
Trychticholorate? Alright, it's an absorption catalyst in toxic waste accidents. It's pretty rare, they stopped making it a couple'a years ago.
What the hell was it doing in the fire?
He works for me.
They're alive, aren't they? Come on, man! Everyone's making such a fucking fuss, just because she's a nun. Just because she wears a penguin suit, the church puts up 50 G for the guys who dared to rape her. Do you think they'd put up a dime if you got raped? Of course not. Or even for your little sister? The virgin? Like shit they would.
She's fucking nine years old! Jesus Christ.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
Who?
Yes.
Why do I dream every night of the whore who brought you water on your road to death? And why have I never forgotten that if she, then I --
I wanna go double or nothing on the next game.
That's my problem. Just put in my bet.
Good. I'll give him an extra 10 grand for his trouble. I hate that motherfucking house and --
What case?
Yeah. Sure. Yeah. We're on it bigtime. Lots of leads. You bet.
B-L-A-K it is.
YEAH!
I didn't mean to scare you like that.
Whoa, hold up li'l sis'.  I done told you 'bout that.  Julius ain't my name, you better recognize Hopkins was our slave name.  My true name is...
BIG BLACK is the first name and AFRICA is the last.
So are you telling me that you wouldn't even introduce me to Delacroix or set up a meeting?  I'm talking 'bout me, your only brother, ya own flesh and blood, hook a brother up, youknowwhatI'msayin'.
Microphone check.  One.  Two.  One. Two.  One.  Two.  Hold up.  I gots to give my peeps some props. Brothers introduce yourself.
You might be right.
No shame in ya game.  She got ya nostrils, ya chnoz is wide open. Sloan's what we certified ladies' men call low hanging fruit.
Sloan never told us she had friends like you.
Look at my lips.
Damn skippy.
You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short?
We might need some mo' money behind this.
Did we get our bill yet?
Are you crazy?  The joint is crawling with cops now.  You wanna go to Rikers?  Go to the hoosegow?
We're starving.
Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks.
No costume.  No blackface.
Yes.  And I say yes because who is to judge?  Who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not?  Who?  Who can play God?
I'm sorry I'm late.
So are you telling me everyone knew about this get-together except you?
...to white?  I still feel all of my scripts would make good shows.
Yes!  Yes!  Yes!  I want a show that will make headlines, that will have millions and millions of households tuned in, glued to their televisions every week.  I want advertisers dying to buy on this show.  I'm gonna squeeze this show out of you if it kills you.
Go on.  Good so far.
I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go.
Exactly!
And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick?
In the projects.  Like Eddie Murphy's "The PJ's."
We think so.
No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that.
We just punched it up a bit.  Made it funnier.
Hello, Mommy, let me get rid of this other call.
Because I had too much pride.  Too much integrity.  I wouldn't lick nobody's butt.  Some material I refused to do.
Nuthin' I can't handle.
Where do you go from here?
I didn't mean that, in life.
The drinking is for the pain.  It doesn't kill it, just dulls it.
I was a hostess at this club, your Daddy was performing and I had never laughed so hard in my life. He asked me to come with him.  I quit my job and we've been together ever since.
You getting cold feet?
I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
The pleasure is mine.
I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny.
It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
I don't want to hear it.
I can't lie to him.  If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
Light?
The first and only time.  A big mistake.  I'm gonna have to ask you not to see Mantan anymore.
I perfectly understand where you're coming from.  As a minority I can relate to your struggle also.  But I think you should give us all a chance.  We want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. Please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.
Pressure?  DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!!  This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
Now I'm privileged?!  Why?  Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare?  Because I didn't call home a cardboard box?  No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too.  Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
I feel fine.
It looks delicious.
C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
Can't beat it with a hammer.  Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
It's gonna be hard for me to get away with the show taking off.
What's a Negro.
Did you just ask me what's a Negro? I'M A NEGRO!!!
The best defense is offense.
This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black.
A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies.
I think that would probably make you the happiest.  When I'm hoofing, I mean really doing my thing, hitting it, nothing compares to that feeling in the world.
I'm more comfortable around my people.
Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.
I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.
Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan.
You tellin' the truth.
The one with da big...
Sleep 'N Eat, one of dem slinky, sexy, little foxy...
...to big.  The in-between one, not too tight, not too lose.
...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than...
No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit.
...too early...
...too late, maybe around...
...like grits and butter...
You expect the unexpected in circumstances of that peculiarity.
How be dat?
Mantan, dat sho' is a whopper.
A song a comin' I feel.
Are you trying to rap to me?
Just a little something' somethin'.
No, before my time.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Y'know what?
You look beautiful like that.
And what?
Why don't you answer?
Not at all, sir.  I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
I never was more in earnest.
It was my joke.  I was tired, and did not care to go farther.  There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
How do you do, sir?
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
I had news of you in Dublin.  Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother?  She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
Sirrah!  Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I will let down the steps for your honor.
You are going to drive to the frontier.
I have orders to gag your honor if you cry out, and to give you this purse containing ten thousand frederics if you do not.
Your honor must lower his voice.
The gentleman has nothing contraband.
Yes, sir.  Here is my letter.
No one, sir.  Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you.  Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin.  The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital.  I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
Certain?
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
To love you until death.  To subscribe to all your commands.
Then you must get it.
I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do.  I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
Do you happen to know Gustavus Adolphus, the thirteenth Earl of Crabs?
Yes!
What is to be done?
You must be very cautious with regard to the company you should meet in Dublin, where rogues and adventurers of all countries abound. I hope you will do me the honor of accepting lodgings in my own house, where Captain O'Reilly will welcome with delight, my gallant young preserver.
Yes, of course.
I see.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
What the devil?  What kind of fools do we have here?  Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Brooksy was better than you, papa, he used not to swear so, and he taught me many good things while you were away.
The milkmaid's daughter?
Is it not a pleasure, gentlemen, for me, as I am drawing near the goal, to find my home such a happy one; my wife so fond of me, that she is even now thinking of appointing a successor?  Isn't it a comfort to see her; like a prudent housewife, getting everything ready for her husband's departure?
And he doesn't care about me?
Tender Hegenheim.
It's ten thirty in the morning.
Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
What do we do?
We found him like this...
Tell me about them.
I'm serious --
They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
And the bodies?
Washout rejects, guys he said were "dumbfucks too stupid to know they dead"...
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
Sir, Dunbar, sir!
Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West --
Why?
We just want to check your pack --
Yeah...
Oh, come on --
Enough to go to prison? Childs' PX scam, Mueller was in on it --
You saw West, right? How was he killed?
From up close or far away?
What don't you know?
Senator Daddy must be thrilled.
You said you wanted to know what happened -- I'm telling you the truth.
Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back.
I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men.
My heart weeps.
No. I said Dunbar.
Then we'll leave it up to the courts -- His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?  Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.
I'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?
He can wait. Kendall's out of surgery.
There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it.
From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty.
The Senator...
I thought you said that wasn't a compliment.
That's preposterous --
You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
You knew Sergeant West?
That is the most unprofessional --
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
Got it.
I don't think that has anything to do with --
You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession.
Watch me.
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here --
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that.  We can do this, Hardy.
What?
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
You couldn't have known --
That's gonna stay my secret.
Maybe... Maybe we were nowhere near. Sometimes mysteries stay mysteries.  I haven't by any chance grown on you, have I?
Isn't this how your story goes?
Seven.
This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?
In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
Poor fucker my ass...
What, "The Truth"? Please. There are degrees of truth, officer, always degrees. Things are not what they seem.
"You're gonna die tonight, faggot". Clear as day.
Because he'd shot Mueller.
You can't threaten me --
I scared Dunbar into silence. He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret --
-- failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself --
Yeah.
Ma'am, Ray Dunbar's black.
He's former Army and the best I've ever seen in a room. Besides, he knows the territory, we did Basic together here.  You've had three hours with Dunbar and haven't gotten a peep, we need to take a different tack.
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
It was on that night Karl met his destiny. And I met mine. Almost.
I just saw the woman I'm going to marry, I know it. But then I lost her.
Yes!
I don't expect to.
Was she nekkid?
I suspect it will hurt a lot.
Apparently I've overlooked this one piece of it, and I'd like to remedy that. You see, in order for the town to be preserved, the trust must own it in its entirety.
Please. Go. Just go.
Go.
Stop.
Well, we were all set to, but there was a complication.
What's your name, Giant?
I love every square inch of it. But I can feel the edges closing in on me. A man's life can only grow to a certain size in a place like this.  So what do you say? Join me?
Okay.
Beats me.
Did you do any of that?
You think I'm up for it?
Really.
What did he say?
I will.
It's rude to talk about religion. You never know who you're going to offend.
Oh, so you know.
What?
What, you're seeing down to my nose? My chin?
It would kill you, huh?
The river?
How what happens?
Somehow, you're better. Different. You're getting ready to go. And I say...
I want you to know, when you left Spectre it opened my eyes. There was a whole life out there that I was not living. So I travelled. I saw France, and Africa, half of South America. Every day a new adventure, that's my motto.
'Fraid so.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward.  Like this.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
Did you?
They met at Auburn.
That's because most of it never happened.
We rented a car.
He's up with your father.
Really! That's wonderful.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Mom, do you know who that is? Blonde hair.
Yes?
Yes. Thank you.
Do you want to stop?
Yeah.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Good. 
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
You're asking for my documents?
What?
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
Oh nothing.
No. It is too judgmental.
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
Good night.
What? What does he want?
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
Yes.
Yes.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
You don't understand anything.
I don't have any money.
I don't want to talk about him.
It's none of your business.
He will come back.
You don't want to talk about it.
Okay we won't talk about it.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
Sometimes neither.
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
You don't have to say anything
Please, there's no... Oh.
Then okay.  So how old were you when you met him?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Thank Christ for that.
No.
No. I think I better just go.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Just wanted to see.
Oh! Gave me a start.
You didn't have to do this.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
Well. Hope you enjoy it.
That'd be nice.
At church?
Hey. You wasn't at'cha work but that nosey gal up at the counter give me your home address. Hope you don't mind me comin' over.
I need ya help again.
Wanna get on somebody 'bout live music, get on ol' Laz, there. He the one got this place shakin' back in the day.
Can I put it in your mouth?
Yeah. Transmission's shot.
Sure.
You been home yet?
You need a ride?
That's not right, really, cuz I...
Careful how you point that gun, boy.
Don't need none.
Best try gettin' ya wits about you 'fore you try to...
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
Whose doin' is that?
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
You just havin' a fit. You ain't goin' nowhere.
No one's gonna hurt you no more.
Don't think that'd be wise.
I know you didn't. But you a grown girl. You can handle it. I got to.
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
Maybe I won't.
Word wit'cha. In private.
Now, hold up.
Don't see generosity much these days. Everything always got a catch. Guess I'm tryin' to say... thank you.
He's fine. Just had a bad fall.
Or what?
I'm tellin' you the truth, dammit. I found her beat. Left for dead. So I brung her home.
I do.
Naw... I got it, Mr. Lazarus.  You wanna tip me, best do it in butter beans. Momma say she need a bag 'a yours, none of that store-bought junk. That's what she said.
Why she got a chain on her?
That's right.
What's on your mind?
Rae don't do this now...
You feelin' sick?
Holy shit, Ronnie!  You're a fuckin' rock star.
Yeah, I do.
The hell you call me?
Let go...
Charlie...
Eating Scungilli, just like the last time you asked.
Beats forty hours on a plane.
Where is the subway station, please.
Number five with a bullet.
Hey, when in Rome --
What does Charlie mean?
Where would you look for the mafia?
The mayor's office, under the bed, the back room at Lombardi's.  And call me Ich.
Leave the rice cake outside and go home!
I don't deserve Ohashi's respect.
Why weren't you at the platform?
Yeah...
I can see that.
We can ask someone I used to work with.  A criminal.  Someone I pay money to...
No.  Don't say anything.  Don't do anything, and for Christ's sake, don't apologize!
If you're gonna give me a hard time, wait outside.
Four goddamn days.  This is going nowhere...
San is an honorable title.
What...?  Why?
Big enough.
It's done.  You don't have to come.
Kampai.
He's on duty.
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
I don't remember you saying no.
Maybe.  If I come visit, we can find out.
Then take it from him.
It is not allowed.
Do you know what this is?
If anything happens to her while I'm here --
I don't think there is another human being in this whole world who would have helped us.
Oh?
Can the maker repair what he makes?
What about E.M.S. recombination?
Put it this way.  Rolls Royces are made to last -- as least they were. But I'm afraid you're a Ferrari. A high strung racing car -- built to win, not to last.
Of course not.
I don't know much about biomechanics, Roy.  I wish I did, but you're out of my league.
His company made us.
Be better if I could talk to him in person.  But he's not an easy man to get to.
Not if everybody is doing their job here at home.  How are things at home?
Five.  Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation.  Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm.  Its guess is that all five are in the city.
Yeah.
Your customer, eh?
Soon as I finish the job.
This is Esper and I'm ready.  Go ahead please.
The five in question are third generation Nexus Sixes, constructed of skin-flesh culture, selected enogenic transfer conversion capable of self-perpetuating thought, para-physical abilities and developed for emigration program.  Are you with me?
Unlike a five, they can sustain massive traumas to several parts of the body without debilitating another.  Sever a leg and it will perform quicker on the remaining leg than the fastest man can run,
And what in your estimation works?
Nexus designated Pris:  incept data December 13 2017, competitive, programmed to provide pleasure for long term spacers.
I'll but you one.  What'll you have?
Shot of vodka, please.
Prosit.
Two months.  But this one is not guy.  It is girl.  His girl.
I'm doing okay.
I think I'm starting to empathize with these Nexus-sixes.
Meaning?
Yeah?
Huh huh.
Nope.
Of course.
What night?
I'm with the American Federation of Variety Artists...
Oh, yeah. You'd be surprised what goes on around here.  I'd like to check the dressing room if I could.
You mean the snake.
Does it eat?
A humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard.  If it's a benefit, it's not our problem.
You have a little boy.  He shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
Me and my dad.
Like?
What's a long time?
Because it's not.
Andies only simulate suffering -- if they're programmed for it.
What?
You know where I been.  I been on vacation.
Severed spine.  You'd better get in here.  Bryant's waiting for you.
Go ahead.
One that relies on human interpretation.  Where's the subject?
Five, maybe six.
Don't move.
A tortoise.  What's that?
I've got stuff.  If you wanna go to my place?
What's that?
What?!
No, you get out of here.
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
I just had a mental picture of...
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Heck, no!  What?!
What is it?!
Perry?
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
They like Dr. Pepper.
My Mom and Dad.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Okay.
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Why?!
Sure.
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
The engine is still running.
Sure.
That's boring!
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Do I look crazy?
Not that one!
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
But, Eve, I would--
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
No.
Not at all.  And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
...All right, Eve.  If you say so.
My mother's like that.
Of course you do.  I'll stay here and pray.
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
Why?
Shit is a French word?
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife?  Isn't that closer?
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
My father is a genius.
Thirty-five.
Up there!!
Yes, please.  I'm looking for all beef patties.
You could have a meat order that big delivered to your home.
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
I'll go up.
Are you in trouble, son?!
Yes.
He'll catch him.  Hi. This is Nina Aron.  I've got a run away and I'm going to need police assistance.
Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been out here when the plane hit.
What about relatives?
Yeah.
The blast?  Honey, I have survived a host of things. Like the song says: "A country boy can survive!"
"Hell up here?"  Honey, it's been hell up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.
Sorry, honey!  I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
Then after that it's safe.
To go up.
No.
All our friends...
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
Hi.
You bet.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
We do?
Excuse me.
--do as I say!
I thought ten years.
What are you doing here?
Shana Gillroy's apartment.  Remember her?  The model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going!  Bye, Adam. Nice coat!
I guess we shouldn't fight in here.
I knew you'd like him.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, that's blunt!
No.
He's from Alaska.
Eve?!
Right here?  Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
Yes, you do!
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior.  Know what else he told me?
We'll find him.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Have him committed.
You bet, Mom! Coming up!
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. For instance, many marriages are saved by.
Fine Frank. Fine. How are you?
Shit. Let's drink to something else. Let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
EXCUSE US por favor! Hey. Let Tits see her kid.
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Yes?
I won't let the bastards get me up against the wall. It's an act of defiance.
It's blue. Blue velvet.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs, and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and...  ...and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
I can't tell you the whole story. I. I took it upon myself. I can't say more.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Does Dorothy know her husband is dead?
Nope, it's new stuff. No smell.
Look. I'm sorry. Just let me leave.
I, I don't know.
Yes.
Or do you just want me? I'm going to let you enter me now.
I'm sorry, maybe I better go Dorothy.
Frank is coming?
That's good.
I'm doing it.
Frank would open you.
Kiss me.
Do you love me?
If I die, then they'll be free. It's getting late, isn't it? I can tell, it's a cold feeling when it's late. It's warm then it gets cold. Jeffrey. I feel it getting cold.
Why are you here?  HMMMMMMMM!!!! OK.
Who, Dorothy?
Yeah, but get outta here. He's comin' back.
Oh he forced you, huh?
He became obsessed with her. She hated him. He had to have her. He kidnapped them to control her. To make her do things. Then she wanted to commit suicide so he started cutting off ears as a warning to her to stay alive. I'm not kidding. Frank loved blue, blue velvet. He had to have Dorothy cause her whole life was blue.
What?
Be right down.
Jeffrey! Nobody wanted you to leave school and go to work in the store, maybe going back to school will be an option one day. I hope so.
Alright.
Is something wrong? What's happened to your face?
Oh, yes, Jeffrey. Come in. He'll be back any minute now. You're welcome to wait. Is it urgent?
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah, I know.
Yeah. okay.
Yeah.
Sure thing, please don't worry about me. Can I help you with the dishes?
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean, no offense.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
Where are they?
I don't know, like I said, she's not my father's case.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. Aren't you curious about my plan?
Alright. the first thing is to get into her apartment and open a window that I could crawl into later.
Alright.
Yeah, let's get outta here. What happened?
Well, it's Friday night and you're a beautiful girl. I guess you would have a date, that does that.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
I don't see how I can, and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. Also it could get you in trouble.
Actually. I've been in twice.
I will. I'll pick you up on the same corner at three thirty-five, okay?
Okay, Sandy.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well- dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. Now get this. In the distance was a murder. A drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Yeah.
Yes. Is that so surprising? Yeah I worry, a lot. I got you into this.
Yeah. I think so. I just had to tell him some of what I knew. Is Friday still on?
What is it?
Nothing, really! It's good to see you.
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Shhh. I'll tell you.
Go ahead!
No Jeffrey!!
Okay.
Well he's the one shooting up all his guys, right? He's scared of the kid. Says he's real good, got every available gun in the city up there.
Up his house. I don't know what's going on but I know it's gotta have something to do with this kid.
Yeah. I was only twelve or thirteen when you guys used to talk about him, like he was a ghost or something.
What?
Where's your gun?
Let's do him right here.
Fuck it! I'm doing it. I deserve it. I've been working for those fat bastards since I was in high school and look at this place.
He probably knew you'd end up nailing the fat guy, maybe one or two more, but he had to know you weren't walking out of there. Figure it out. Shooter's dead on the scene. No in-depth investigation. It'd slide right off his back. 'Cause as much as I love ya, you're not exactly Don Corleone. What would he be losing? A thirty- five year old delivery boy?
Fuck, man! I may as well have posted flyers. Right out in public, man.
This guy is very sharp. If he hasn't figured us out yet, he will.
You won't do it Connor, you won't. You love me man.
Connor, is that you?
Is that worthless brother of your there? I want you both ta hear this.
Well, you know how it is with him. Always complainin' he's never turnin' a profit on St. Patty's. Whole damn family goes down there with no money, cause we know he can't bear ta charge us.
Come on, ma. Out with it. Who came out first?
We... met them last night.
How many?
Shut it. It's Ma.
Yeah. It's been twenty-seven years.
...so that which is good may flourish
For what?
What is all this "they" shit? This ain't a movie.
All right, get the stupid fuckin' rope.
Yes, we are.
Yes.
Holy shit. Who? How many?
I'm strangely comfortable with it.
A-fuckin'-men!
We do not ask for your poor or your hungry.
With every breath we shall hunt them down.
Oh, come on now Rozengurtle. I was just tryin' ta get a rise outta ya.
That's just fucking weird. I have no idea.
These guys were pros. I think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...
What?
Crime of passion. He just went nuts. He would have shot everyone in here. He just ran out of bullets.
Twist of lemon!
Shit! Shit!
Yeah, fuck it. If you think about it, it's all you can do really. You can't tell him it was us. Go in braggin' and shit.
Hey, Murph.
So?
Well, I'd say that makes him a lia- fuckin-bility.
We have to go now.  We're on the lamb.
You'll make it outta here. You can't ever stop, not ever.
You have entered the house of the Lord of your own free will speaking of beliefs and feelings. Is it so much to believe that God has brought you here?
Yes.
Open it!
Fuck you Vincenzo.
I caught your show down at the velvet room at the Holiday Inn, loved it when you busted into Viva Las Vegas.
Black hair. Paul Michael Glaser.
Right. The blond guy.
He says. This is he.
Kind of. Except we've already got the keys.
Nothing. Go ahead.
You're out! I'm not working with either one of you!
Unlock that door.  Check the aisles.
Oh, shit. That was scary. In the middle of the robbery. The manager looks at me. Right in the eye. And goes, I'm going to remember you.
Bob?
Then you're going to have to dye it, Anthony. We've got to hide our identities. Especially after Bob crashed the car.
Hi.
What. What's the matter?
No kidding.
No, no. Look. OK. Let's stay here until we find out what's going on.
Don't worry about it, Bob.
This was in fourth grade.
After that my parents never let me go to Dignan's again.
Where was it parked?
Maybe he just went to the store.
We said 48 hours.
Bob went to help his brother. I understand that and I can't help it if you don't.
I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
What?
I don't think we can do that.
I don't know, Dignan. I just --
You're so spoiled. What is "not good" to you? Only a few hundred --
I know.
Get out of the way.
Easy, Dignan. It's OK.
Look, you're going to do fine. It's OK to be scared.
He was all right.
Stand by, Bird Dog.
It was Bob. His walkie talkie's busted.
I don't know.
I'll see you there.
I don't think so.
Oh, I'd say about --
Behind Bob's house.
What can I say? It's jail. You don't sleep when you want to. You don't eat when you want to.
Nice to meet you.
Thanks.
So do I.
Me?
Yeah.
See you, Bob.
He looked too shaken-up.
And if Future Man doesn't get let out of jail in 48 hours, then we go back. All right?
No, I don't mind.
Sixty days?
Why were you drawing the Holy Mary?
Jesus Christ! No.
Sure.
No.
Who's got the car keys?
Temporarily.
Is that Buckethead?
True.
I don't know about that.
Not even for emergencies?
As much as I want. When these plants bud I'll probably have about six thousand dollars worth of weed.
Good question.
You're paranoid, Bob.
I warned you, Dignan.
Well, don't blame me. I told you.
God DAMMIT.
Don't count it.
No. All he'll remember is a guy with a piece of tape on his nose.
That's true. That would give me nightmares.
I told you they were there.
It's registered in my mother's name.
See you in a little while.
Well, the marijuana crop is a good start.
They also found my two beam scale in the garage.
I was just going to use it to see how much I had.
Well, obviously, we got to go back.
Don't threaten me, Bob.
Let's go.
I didn't have any choice.
I know it, man. Hang on.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't go around telling people lies about me.
This is Anthony Adams, Mr. Henry.
Can't get it. It won't... 
Will it track back to us?
And the Landy woman?
Never heard of it.
What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me? You want my desk? Is that it?
...this is Conklin's computer.
I wasn't sleeping.  You OK?
Thanks.
What?
Then what?
You're a liar.
YOU'RE A LIAR!
Sorry. Old habits.
I like it here.  Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a good spot.
Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked out.
Two years we're scribbling in a notebook --
-- it's always bad and it's never anything but bits and pieces anyway!  You ever think that maybe it's just making it worse? You don't wonder that?
I do remember something good. All the time. I remember you.
I don't mean that. I worry when you try to ignore it.
The Telegraph office.
We pushed it. We got lazy.
Back there -- at the corner -- Hyundai -- silver --
-- where? -
What if it's not who you think it is?
There must be another way!
Tell me later.
IS SHE RUNNING TREADSTONE?
They know!  They know you were here. They know you killed these two guys. They know you and Conklin had something on the side. They don't know what it is, but they know!
It was Pamela Landy's op. The guy was going to sell-out a mole or something. I haven't been debriefed on exactly what it was.
What do you mean?
You never worked Berlin...
I'm working on it.
And the Germans can't match it?
Then get a number, they need to know who they're dealing with.
-- the hotel -- how far? --
I want to look at the room.  Check it out.
What?
-- no! -- not me! -- no other people! --
That's where we came out.
For a thief. A mole. I vetted the source, Marty. He's real. If it does nothing more than narrow the list of suspects, it's a bargain at ten times the price.
I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved. And that whatever information I was going to buy in Berlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from wherever he's been hiding to kill again.  How's that scan?
Before this? Before Bourne? No.
Look, what do you want me to say? I was there. I believed him.
I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe traumatic breakdown.
You mean, did I want a date?
What do you want from me? I was reassigned. I'm out.
And why is that?
Yeah, that'll work...What the hell was he doing here?
Are we hacking or asking?
My brother and nephew perished two days ago, when their hay cart turned over.
It was in Latin, sir.
You've all sworn to Longshanks.
So let the council swear publicly.
He has already agreed to come.
You are surprised he would lie? Balliol was murdered in a church yesterday. You are Longshanks' new designate. You will be king.
I hear. This Wallace is a bandit, nothing more.
I have ordered conscriptions...
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
Wallace's followers.
Mornay has come. So will the Bruce.
We're here to stay. We don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.
No. One of us is enough.
I wanna have supper waitin'.
A common thief.
We don't split up!
Confess, and you may receive a quick death. Deny, and you must be purified by pain. Do you confess? ...DO YOU CONFESS?!
How do you know this?
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
A magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt Wallace to fight -- and fight he did.
It's battle I want, not talk.
A Lordship. And gold. That I should become Judas.
It will numb my wits, and I must have them all. If I'm senseless, or if I wail, then Longshanks will have broken me.
We all end up dead. It's only a question of how. And why.
No English lord would trust an Irishman!
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
How soon?...
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Great. I'll see you soon.
Something must've happened! What set him off?
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
No, it's just weird with him being such a brain and all, I just wondered if he was ever able to remember stuff he'd forgotten.
What? What could he do?
How's Kayleigh doing? She all right?
Damn it, Mom. I told you I need them all!
Can you protect me?
Straight up.
Shit. I knew you were crazy.
No, protecting her.
Photos?
Sorry, dude. Just figured it'd be okay with you bein' sick and all.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
You'll see.
I know I've been actin strange lately. It's just that... I don't want anything to happen to us.
No. Just that you need to hurt me with it. I've been where you've been.
You wouldn't believe me. I mean, people always say, "You wouldn't believe me", but in this case, it's not even worth trying.
Different? How?
I couldn't give a shit if you believe me or not, and frankly I'm too tired to prove it to you.
Then forget that. How about... you prefer the smell of a skunk to flowers, you hate cilantro because for reasons unknown to you, it reminds you of your step-sister.
Know what?
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
...yes.
Been there, done that.
Bullshit. I'll send you a postcard when I've made everything perfect again.
I'd say blow me. Get the pledges to do it.
I won't let you down, Professor Carter.
Yeah. I've been keeping journals since I was seven.
Deal. Now read me something.
Sure. I was gonna make a new one, anyway.
Yeah, good, what else do you remember?
Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh.
Fat little baby, crying for mommy.
It wasn't enough that the whole world loves you, but you had to take away the last person on earth who didn't think I was a piece of shit.
Right, Evan. I believe you just said "sick fuck."
Sorry, Mrs. T. He's been out of sorts lately.
I think I'll go check out the chapel.
Huh?
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
Aw, hey now, that was a compliment.
Yeah, you do that, Lenny.
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Oh, yes.
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
Oh, yes, please.
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Goodnight, Monsieur Rick.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Er, my check, please.
It's not for sale at any price.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Well, good luck. But be careful.  You know you're being shadowed?
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
Good day.
And the other alternative?
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Looking for a job.
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
You can believe that if you want to.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
No.
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
-- Yes?
I love you very much, my dear.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I said, ask your wife.
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
Are you quite finished with us?
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Good day.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
A leader, like Laszlo?
But everybody's having such a good time.
Huh!
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
-- Thanks. I will.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Put it down as a gesture to love.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
What friend?
Oh, he won't be followed here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
You think of everything, don't you?
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Our expenses?
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
I never make plans that far ahead.
-- Sacha, call a cab.
Take your hands off me!
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
I like it fine here.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Then don't have a drink.
No, I don't.
You said it!  Here's looking at you, kid.
Worse than Warsaw.
Take it.
Fix raft first.
Why do they have to die for me?
You quitter you quitter you quitter.
If I don't have a sea anchor I'll capsize.
Thank you for fucking up my life.
Nothing out there but ocean.
No.
Okay.  Sure.
Just sit here, I'll get us some lunch.
You smell like formaldehyde.
Chuck, forget the Xerox.  So Russia didn't turn out well?
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
A ring.  I wanted a ring.
It's our dog.  It belongs to us.
A week, max.  Okay?  Okay?
The regular flight is scheduled for oh three hundred tomorrow.
Dehydration.  Vitamin deficiency. Protein deficiency.  Any or all of the above.
You bet I do.  High tide comes right up to this road.
Yeah.
Let's eat.
Come on down to the plant.  It's state of the art.  We're doing for chickens what FedEx did for the delivery business.
It's nothing you did, Mom, believe me.
There's settled folks, and there's nomads.  You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
Roger got me on.  I wasn't doing anything, and -- but you're back, you're really back.  I would have come to Memphis, but --
We're on.
I'm most definitely not dead.  And as I recall, you're the sick fucker.
I never thought it would end.  Then it did.  It was so great to be saved, I couldn't stop laughing.
Hallelujah.
Would you do us the honor of joining us? We're just sitting down at mess.  Pork chops and gravy, cranberries, baked potatoes with all the trimmings, fresh- baked bread, apple pie...
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
She died of *secrecy*, she died of *ignorance*...
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
I was lookin' for Wally's letter. I was gonna show it to Homer...  They made him a captain already-- *Captain* Worthington!
Good night, Daddy.
Two.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?  They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
"King Kong". It's really good.
I *did* like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
It will be okay.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
You got up! You *did* something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a *decision*!
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Well, this *is* an orphanage.
I know what you've been doing.
*Homer* liked it!  Didn't you?
Homer was born *here*, in, what was it, 1922?
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
Why can't we have pumpkins for Christmas, too? We don't get any good presents at Christmas, anyway.
I don't remember.
Maybe I was kissing someone and he bit me.
I must have been *dreaming* of kissing someone.
A B-24 Liberator.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
Yes, for both.
In other words, scurvy.
It's *your* splice! You blame me for everything!
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Of course.
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Yeah, well... you could move on with *us*, man! You could move on somewhere *warm*!
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
Them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!
You mean *swimmin'*. I ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!
It's encephalitis B. He's recovering at Mount Lavinia Hospital, Ceylon.  Uh... Captain Worthington is paralyzed.  Waist down. He won't walk.
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Tell him what you want, Muddy--*you* is the crew boss today.
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
Oh god. I'm overbearing and rude. Lily. Lily Finn.
Maybe you can help us understand what's so hard about getting a corporate loan.
They scare people off because most people lack vision. Vision and balls. Present company excluded of course.
We know exactly how we're going to make the money back. There in lies the Catch-22
The standard ten.
Gordo plays the inside. You're the Shill.
Suits used to say that in any con, sooner or later someone's going to start asking the right questions. Usually, it takes a little longer.
Cue the fucking violins. Come on... It's getting cold.
You're pissed we didn't get credit?
I gotta work off some of this adrenaline. I got a line on this Pawn Shop guy over in Brooklyn. Anybody want in?
And what about Big Al?
We get fifty percent. And we get clear of the King.
So then Miles walks straight into the Creative Director's office and says "The code's fine, the program's for shit" and throws down like a thousand pages of code on the guy's desk!
And all you need to do for your ten percent is put some paperwork through and push a button tomorrow.
Eight A.M. flight.
I'd like this cashed, please.
Jake. You can call me Jake. Here and there.
You know, back in the day, grafting was considered a gentleman's racket. Good suits, good food... The Underworld of the Underworld. A grifter had to survive on his wits, his instincts... I like that. I like the idea of that. These days, things being what they are, guys like me gotta stay low. It's all take, take, take. You can't just be fucking witty about it.
Of course, your line of work's only as good as the people you find.
Tip was fine, Jake. We were a little more curious about the Fed.
Something stupid.
Jake. Jake Pearson. I go to lawschool with your daughter. Carolyn. We met once or twice.
Y-y-you fucking shot him! That's what happened!
You interested in a little work?
Take a deep breath and count to ten. It's not that kind of work. You're Lily, right?
You're working Daffy's block. He was going to break your kneecaps. Pick- pockets can be so bitchy sometimes. I told him you were with us, so that's two you owe me.
Gee thanks. Now I don't have to find that bridge to jump off.
Here's my deal -- Don't waste my time. What do you want me for anyway? You don't even know me.
Hey, I got it! Take some mental notes. You just might learn something here.
What?
You're just going to have to trust me.
Then show me how.
Honey, this is Mr. Lewis. Carolyn Lewis's father. Mr. Lewis, this is my wife, Lily.
It's what I do. It's my job.
Good quality porn has it's place in the world.
Then he grabbed me and threw me down on the floor, that really cold linoleum tiled hospital floor and started ripping my uniform off.  He said he was going to "fuck some sense into me."
You know why I told you that, Jake?  Because I trust you too.
There are three people I trust -- him, him and a guy who got killed. I don't know who you are! You're like some stray dog that wandered into the house. So I'm telling you to cut loose of this. No one's looking for you, Not the King, not Moonan and not Gillette. Just go wherever it is you would go. It's over.
What about what?
You sure we're clear?
Just an idea, but let's just fucking split. We'll meet up anywhere. Akron or Austin or Atlanta. Anywhere...
How do you know the King's going to let you walk?
Michelle Strigo. Loan officer.
There is no scam! I've got a fucking sign on my back! I can't leave town now and come back with a suitcase full of money. You get it? It's over. We walk.
And we got rid of the red head.
Don't worry, I'll settle up with your boss. We haven't skipped town yet.
My fucking heart bleeds.
Let me ask you something... You really think I'm going to come this close, this fucking close and let my guard down? I'll get square with your boss. I'll get square with whoever did Al. I'll get square with everybody. Then I'm going going to cash in my chips and be on my way to a new and better me far away from here.
Maybe he's got it right. Maybe we're all just looking for a safe place to shit.
Eee Oott Auught!
I saw you go up from the Knecker, working that Grind, learning the Barnard's Law and I thought, "the kid's a prodigy." But I know that if you're using these goods... So then I figure, what's worth that? You're either looking for a little history or a retirement fund. Who's the Mark?
I want to get out from under all this for good. And I want to fuck them all doing it.
A Fed? Is he close?
Look, I'm not a confrontational person by nature.
What do you get out of it?
To who?
All men are cheats.
What's the Blue Book price?
I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
Get what?  Are you accusing me of cheating?
You want me drunk?
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
You've got such beautiful hands.
It's only hair. I haven't changed.
I'll see you in my dreams.
Do you have to swear all the time?
Marion, stop this.
Marion. It's a book.
Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
You were talking in your sleep.
Then what?
Don't let yourself down.
Absolutely not.
I don't gamble.
That's fine.
You choose.
What kind of trouble?
Was that why you did the two grand? I couldn't help you.
Forget it, Jani. It'll never work.
Robbery's not criminal?
You're serious.
Wait a minute...
No thank you.
Jack! It's Jani.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Who did it? Tell me!
Too much. Eighteen hundred.
Over the river.
Nice car.
You've done pretty well.
Some other time.
I don't cheat, Jack. You've got it wrong.
That bitch? No.
I'll tell you later.
Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
Has he?
It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
Any exceptions?
Five.
Five.
I said good call.
We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.
Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
How?
A pleasure. Pity about Bella.
I read that with a quantum increase of seven.
What flickering light?
Key? Key? What is the key?
Boiler, we're alive. My heart.
Time to start talking.
Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.
Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient life in the Horsehead Nebula...
All right, then...
Energy shielding positive function.
No.
I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.
But how do you know you exist?
Why, that would mean... I really don't know what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.
Yes, well...
I recall distinctly the detonation order. My memory is good on matters like these.
Hmmm...
...nine seconds...
Yes, Doolittle.
Doolittle...
I need a computer reading on a fail- safe mark.
Any planets?
What?
Who cares. Don't bother me.
Out where?
Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?
I don't like to go below since Commander Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I'd sleep up here...
They are a body of asteroids that make a complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The Phoenix Asteroids... From what I've heard, Doolittle, they glow... glow with all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they've seen in the time they've been travelling -- the birth and death of stars, things we'll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all empty, but it isn't. In between the stars, it's seething with light and gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no one on Earth has ever seen... No one but the Phoenix Asteroids...
Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
Yeah?
Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers doing?
What was that, Doolittle?
Sorry.
Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.
No?
I'm on a break.
Yeah, sure, I understand.
But the boss knows I always been loyal.
You didn't tell me you lived with her.
Where?
Don't look down.
Theo rode for this place a long time, man.
I ain't mad at you...
Just thought maybe he'd like a little coffee with his saliva.
They took my daughter.
Like I said-- This isn't my regular line of work so I'm making it up as I go.
Hello...
I don't want to move away.
Are we in some kind of trouble?
When?
No, because it's the Egyptian goddess Bast.
Now you know who I am, where I live.  I figured I better find out who I'm dealing with in case you were looking to hurt me.
Too early to tell.
Something.
You need to get out more.
How well do you remember the lab?
So, you know the lengths he'll go to keep her from going public... I'm turning Lauren over to Canadian law enforcement tomorrow.  They'll put her in witness protection, but if you're with her the risk of her safety goes way down.
Somebody's got to.
I don't know what to say.
She may be easy on the eyes but she's trouble, trust me.  Hot run to two-oh-two Sansomme.
Oh?
How sweet.  Standing by your man, even after what he did.  You're a very understanding person.
You're also a fool.
Now, here's how it's gonna be, Lydia. You're gonna take your threats and your acrylic nails, and you're gonna go home and figure out your marriage, instead of trying to make other people feel as miserable as you do, understand?
I understand.
They don't exactly have a search engine for finding a bunch of kids with bar- codes on their necks, which is something I'm not even going to ask about--
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Besides, think of the drama I'm sparing Natalie.
But, of course, there's nothing self- serving in that scenario.
I'll bet you can.  Sit.
Quite a mouth on a girl so young...  ...but my guess is talking is not what it does best.
I told her it's just business to you, that all you want is a reasonable solution to this.  You give her daughter back, she agrees to leave the country.  I play the guarantor, drive her down to Mexico tonight, and put her on a train to Brazil or wherever.
She's gonna need to know that her little girl's alright.
Feel like the dog's dinner.
What if he's on the level?
But there's another side--
I'm the victim here.
Who either doesn't care, or could have me killed.  Either way, Natalie's still gonna find out.
Or, I dissolve into an angry, hysterical wreck who never wants to see your lying ass again, which is probably what would really happen.
You don't.
Easy Sketchy.
Lydia may not have been one of humanity's finer specimens but--
None of this would've happened if you had exercised even a smidgen of good judgement or self-restraint, which you didn't.
You were trying to have it both ways and you were being completely selfish.  And if I ever find out you're going out the back door on Natalie again, you're the one who's gonna be hanging by your ankles three stories up.  Understand?
Shut-up...
I was on call. 
He's sick.
How 'bout you don't break my sneakers on this.  The guy is seriously not well.
I don't know how to break this to you, Normal, we're all looking for another job.
Theo's dead.
You're too kind. I'm Amanda.
More than anything in the world.
Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.  And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
You're not gonna chicken out on me now, are you? We've got your KISS song playing and everything.
Thanks.
Right, slow...
Oh, I'll remember it till the day I die. His name was... Simpleton the Simian? No, Samson Samoan... No, simply, similar...
I have never heard a girl squeeze cheese in my entire life.
So? Your mom's car has a CB, radar detector and cruise control, check?
Gimme a second, dudes. Lemme think.
Next stop: the 2:45 to Detroit Rock City!
Lex, am I gonna have to lock you in the trunk till we reach Detroit? Don't worry, these babies are built for speed.
Hey, disco dude, it's cool...
Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
What?! Are you mentally deranged, Jam?
Guys, GUYS! Come on, if this is anyone's fault, it's mine. I was the one who grabbed Trip's jacket by mistake. It's my fault and I apologize.
Uhh... nothing.
Besides, those jeans are so tight I can see your penis.
If I'm anything like you, I'll deserve him.
Okay... when she peeled off that gown, you'll never guess what she was wearing underneath.
Splendid! I love a good game of Name That Nightie.
You're one to talk, Lex. Your mom's a fuckin' dyke.
Waitaminit, dudes! I got it! Maybe we can glue the tickets back together!
Smug, Trip! Not snug, smug.
Simple-icity is more like it. And you guys thought Jam was in trouble before. Wait till Mrs. Bruce finds out he went to that concert with us.
Hello summer detention.
Fuck you, Lex! This whole thing wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for you jinxing us. I just made an honest mistake.
It's not nearly enough, punk.
No, you gimme your gun, boy!
Not if I shoot first!
Yeah, you did!
Whoa, easy, Trip, this is radio, not "Taxi Driver." Now listen up cause this next part is crucial. Stay on the line so we can get your full name, information, and...
So... in order to travel back in time, you'd have to have a big spaceship or something that can travel faster than the speed of light --
So... that's it?
Not until like... eighth grade.
You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.
We just want to guide you in the right direction.
You'll know soon enough.
Do you believe in time travel, Donnie?
Take it off. I want to see you.
I am so sorry.
It is the name of my father... and his father before me.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Sure.
He fled. They still can't find him.  My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
Until it withers away.
No. I just wake up and I look around, try to figure out where I am... how I got there.
Why?
I don't want to talk about it.  So what happened to your neck?
Why not just buy your baby a night light?
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
Are you okay?
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
The whole movie. Let's go.
Where is she?
But you're OK?
It's safe here.
There's something you have to know, Gretchen.  Everything is going to be just fine.
Yeah...
Just place an X in the appropriate place on the Lifeline.
If you don't complete the assignment, you'll get a zero for the day.
Do you get to meet Ed?
How does it feel to have a wacko for a son?
So we're not supposed to tell anybody what nobody knows?
He said to follow him.
I think... about... "Who's the Boss?"
No, I don't think about fucking my family. That's sick!
I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
Have you ever made love, Donald?
I... I was playing with fire.
What else makes you feel regret?
If God exists?
I have the power to build a time machine.
Well, don't worry... I'm taking my medication.
I was just being honest.
Well, Gerald, I think you're afraid.
Come again?
But let me remind you that this treatment is... experimental.
You're not a bitch.
If you think Michael Dukakis will provide for this country prior to the point when you decide to squeeze one out, then I think you're misinformed.
How did you know --
It is a big deal.
I guess they made him do it.
But now you can't go.
This meeting of the PTA was called to inform the parents of our ongoing investigation...
No more fuckin' for her.
She's right over there.
I -- I'm quittin' the pageant.
Simple. Just say, "Mom, I know you sacrificed everything -- relationships, dreams -- your tummy, ass and thighs -- all to bring me into this world. All so I could have tap lessons and be in the pageant -- the same one you were in. But, y'know what? I'm quittin'." There. Easy as pie.
Yeah, you betcha...
Right by the airport -- Oh, Amber...
Our baby's going to Nationals! Lincoln, Alabama -- look out!
Oh, yeah, sure. You know, every pageant is special, but this one is extra-special to me. When I was seventeen, I don't know if you know this, but I was crowned Mount Rose's American Teen Princess. And this year... drum roll please, my lovely daughter, Rebecca Ann Leeman is competin'.
Mom, look, don't say anything. First of all, I'm not pregnant.
No, wait. It -- it was here before the openin' number... wait. What am I sayin'? I should just ask you, Becky. Where is it?
Oh, Amber, like you're the only one who visits Mary.
Bitch!
Here, have some.
Yes...
Yah-sure, fine... fine.
Oh, Jesus H. Christ!
Oh, naw. Hi.
Okay. Take her purse.
They told me to practice.
It smells funny. Like gasoline.
Mm-hm.
"U.S.A. is A-okay."
"Can I? I'm Amer-I-Can!" People ask me where I get this. I don't know, it's... maybe a gift from God or somethin'.
This pageant's like a roach motel.
Sammy Davis, Jr., honey.
Yah -- Gladys had me order that swan special made from Mexico  in case Becky won. I do a lotta business with those people. I always offer to pay 'em in tacos.  Whoo, they love that.
A.k.a. Minneapolis -- St. Paul.
Nothin' too showy!
You'd think they'd build the parking lot of America to go with the Mall of America!
We need more bars!
Harold!
English! English, you stupid little retard! We America now, Tina!
What, you deaf? I say shut up -- shut up -- SHUT UP!  Cut her outta this!
"My dear"...
I no gotta new-rosis.  My uncle he's- a got a flower shop -- he's-a gotta new-rosis.
All right -
Well, maybe he's still the vice- president.  Now if I were to offer you --
Well, if you wanna work in the post- office you'll have to stick out your tongue.
I've got just the job for you -- Secretary of War.
What do I get?
I think we oughtta have a standing army, so we can save money on chairs.
Who said I had a gun... Gimme those plans, you paper snatchers --
That's all right.  We let you have twenty-five thousand men -- and we both start even.
Sure.
Fine - keep on yelling - Do everything you can to disturb Firefly - Now what about your cousin?
All right -- I'll go out and find one.
If chewing gum is chewed, The chewer is pursued And in the hoosegow hidden...
Tired!  I'd like to stretch this into a week -
You swine!
Yes.
I don't remember.
Well, maybe I am a little headstrong...  But, you know, it's awfully hard to forget what he called me. 
Oh, your Excellency, you take me off my feet.
Why -- why -- of course.
Don't bother me - I'm thinking -- What was that?
THIS IS TREASON!!  What a fool I was to listen to your siren song and fall a helpless victim under the insidious spell of your irresistible charms --
Well no -- not exactly -- but --
I didn't come here to be insulted.
This is terrible!
My dear niece -- I must ask you not to interfere.  War is not a woman's problem.
She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.
No, I think a whiskey.
I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
He's sick, Bytes. He's going to die.
I intend to.
Right... Right.
No sir, he's got bronchitis and he's been badly beaten.
He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
Do you think they'll go along with us?
Of course. How long did you and Mr. Treves prepare for this interview?
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies, Thou anointest my head with oil...
Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...  I pray God he's an idiot.
Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits.
I've brought you some things. I hope you'll like, Mr. Merrick. I hope you don't think it too forward.
Well you must go. It is one of the most beautiful places on earth. Of course, I'm rather partial.
I fear not, Mrs. Kendal. Even in the short time he was gone the size of his head has increased rapidly... as is his pain.
Yes. There is nothing more frustrating, nothing that makes a physician feel more useless, than standing by watching his patient deteriorate. And when that patient is a friend, no... no, there's absolutely nothing I can do.
Yes.
Good morning.
Yes.
...I learned a long time ago.
That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"
John Merrick.
Say "Mmmerrick."
Hello, my name is John Merrick.
Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say...
Good evening. Very well, thank you. And you?
I promise you. You will never see the inside of that horrible place again. You will never, ever go back to the workhouse... or that man. It's a splendid room, don't you think?
How is your tea, John?
Of course.
Your mother?
Good morning.
Yes, John.
Mr. Treves, tell me... tell me truly. Is it alright, did I make any mistakes that you can see?
Yes! The workhouse!
Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
Yes. John wants it.
John thinks it's very dashing. Something no gentleman should be without. I'm inclined to agree.
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
Never mind. I'm the owner.
But one day I'll catch you... Like I caught her...
Well, my dear, I think you'll find it's all a question of what you want to believe in.... I have slightly more experience of these matters than you...
These? What are THESE? They're swords.
What... you mean "got into bed with" them?
"The fifth one this week"!
I'll bring it back.
Goodbye, Aud...
But, Aud... I... I came to find someone...
The sun is up beyond the clouds -- where it always is.
And you're not just saying it because you think we want you to?
Yes?
They'll be more than "hurt" if Halfdan the Black lands! Ow!
Don't talk nonsense.
Oh! No! No... of course not... it's just I hadn't expected it to be quite so big.
About raping me?
You DON'T like it, do you?
I dunno... you looked so... so vulnerable...
I don't know! I just did!
I know. Snorri! Get your oar out!
It saved my father!
That's my boy!
Row! Row! Row!
ROW!
What "magic"?
We don't HAVE to help anybody.
But you're the Gods!
No! We'd be the first living men to set foot in the Halls of the Gods.
Leif, you sit there. Even, you sit there. Harald, you'd better sit over there...
Has anyone told him we've got a dragon eating our boat?
Right.  Farewell... for the last time... may the gods prevent...
What's the matter with Bjorn?
What is it?
What if we could find Bi-Frost the Rainbow Bridge?
Over the Edge of the World.
Bye... sorry...
Do what?
I hope the Dragon of the North Sea gets YOU AND your lord.
No, I'm not.
How can you help feeling bad when you're sea-sick?
That's it!
Hang on...
I... I...
It's me. I'm just going to water the dragon... 
What are you doing, Keitel Blacksmith?
What have you got there?
I KNOW! I'VE HEARD IT ALL 1 THOUSAND TIMES!
I'm just building up to it, Dad.
Yes, Mum.
Yes, Mother. Goodbye, Dad.
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
Say hi to Naomi.
I did. You said, things were fine.
I told you that later.
Why?
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
I'm Joel.
I'm not nuts.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
Very much.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
Yes.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
I want to have a baby.
I don't want to talk about this here.
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
No. Thanks.
No.
What do you mean?
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
You had the whole human race pegged.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
Yeah, like that.
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I think she's great.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
I love you.
Tomorrow?
Make love?
Oh, um...
Hey, Joel --
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
I just walked in.
I'm like a joke to them.
Clementine. I should just maybe talk to her.
I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
I didn't want to go. I was too nervous. I thought, maybe you were a nut. But you were exciting. You called from upstairs.
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
I hope you get your work done.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Oh! Great. That's great!
We'll speak soon.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Hi.
Sorry. I just --
Then why did you ask me?
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
Yes?
Is that Nietzsche?
It's no big deal.
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
The guy we're doing? He's disappeared from the map. I can't find him anywhere.
I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic. I had to go pee.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Maybe after the holidays then.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
You can if you want.
Jesus, Patrick!
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
It's a quote book.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Clockworks.
The Clock People?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
I'm staying with the Countess.
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
What guy?
I have to go, Julian.
Tired...
A born freak can only go uphill.
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
Uh, yeah Coop, I'm still here.
Justin?
Coop, where are you...
What about the accumulator...?
I'm telling you, I saw it...
Goddammit, DJ, it was not a hallucination! I saw a man, he was on fire. And then he disappeared.
It's not a distress call. It's a warning.
Hear what?
Oh God...
A power drain --
His peritoneum has ruptured...
I apologize for the short notice, Bill, but we've had something come up that requires your immediate attention. Lyle?
Navigation Control tried to hail the vessel. This was the only response.
It's been two years since she died. He's over it.
The dark inside me.
How do you know all this?
Dr. Weir, Admiral Hollis would like to see you as soon as possible.
So where are they? Starck, any luck with the bio-scan?
Skipper...
Do it.
Justin.
Captain, I didn't come out here to sit on your bridge, I need to be on that ship...
In an emergency, the charges detonate in series, destroying the central section and separating the personnel areas from the rest of the ship. That way, if the gravity drive malfunctions, the crew could use the foredecks as a lifeboat.
Negative.
It's possible that a burst of gravity waves escaped from the Core, distorting space-time. They could be what hit the Lewis and Clark.
If it worked, yes.
The Event Horizon's computer think's it's 2034.
Check the Core for radiation. Carbon dioxide may be the least of our worries.
You're insane. You've lost your mind.
Starck... Cooper...
That's not it. That ship was built to go faster than light... That's just wrong, it goes against everything we know...
Love to.
Smith, where the hell have you been?!
Get outside, go back to work. I'll join you shortly.
Captain, we got a problem.
She was right behind me, I turn around, she's gone. She could be anywhere.
Let's go.
I just finished drying...
What's causing the readings?
Not acceptable. I want to know what's causing those readings. If the crew is dead, I want the bodies, I want the crew found.
Dr. Weir, you were right there, you must have heard something, seen something...
There was a another surge in the bio- readings right before you... you saw what you saw. We picked up a similar readings right before the Clarke was damaged. What if there were a connection between the two? The gravity waves, the hallucination, all part of an defensive reaction, like an immune system...
What's going on in there, Starck?
He's awake, he's in the airlock, he's not wearing a suit.
You better hurry. He's engaged the override, we can't open the inner door.
Five seconds.
Whatever was on that bridge wasn't Weir.
Blow it up?
Yes.
He's been past Mars?
Isn't it possible that you were traumatized by finding the body on the bridge?
Not according to the computer.
Skipper, Justin just activated the door. It's on a thirty second delay...
She's not ugly.
It still has air and reserve power, we can activate gravity and life support.
Picking up magnetic interference.
Explosive decompression.
Hmmm. Claire used to tell me I loved the Event Horizon more than I loved her. I told her that wasn't true, I just knew the Event Horizon better, that's all.
It wants me. I have to go.
I'm alright. Please.
I like the sound of that.
Is it safe?
Oh, he did.
It's not him. It's them.  I can't live like this.
Victor must've taken him.
Don't come any closer for a sec. This is gonna be kind of a shock... You remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?
Deb, it's me. It's still me.
This wasn't our first stop, in case you forgot NASA. And Victor's not that bad. He's just a little...  Larger than life.
External SRBs, orbital system engines. Its just like the shuttles you flew in --
Should?
Three days. I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
Yeah, you and Debbie and perfect --
Ben, I don't know if this thing'll change us back or make us worse. I need you to be patient for a little while longe--
They're fine. Everybody else... is fine.
Give me the god damn mirror!
I've never felt better in my life. When do you get off work?
Stay right. Left is trouble.
Ben, are you there?
Act. Here we go again. Reed, what if we got these gifts for a reason? What if we have some, you know... like, calling?
Grow up, Johnny. You want to run around on fire for the rest of your life?
You were at 4000 Kelvin. Any hotter, you're approaching supernova --
Blockhead started it!
No, I'm sorry, for pushing you out.
Showtime.
Sir, I'm sure he wouldn't put himself --
Actually, uh, people seem to think the scar "humanizes" you.
That's why. Because I could have any other woman... You know, when they asked Caesar "why England," he said, "because it's not mine."
Never better.
It's been changed.
Yes, thanks.
What? What do you mean you --
We need to get past them.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
What in the world would give me that idea?
Of course. Of course.
With the right energy, we can stabilize the storm. Maybe tie into the city grid...
No way to know. Without more tests, experiments.
You need a doctor.
Hilarious.
He's had some kind of... reaction to exposure from the cloud. And he's not the only one.
Which is precisely the point. Analysis is over. It's time for action. My men could have mass-produced this by now.
I told you, I'm fine. It's you I'm worried about.
I'm just saying, I know what it's like to lose something you love. To see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.
For your sake I hope you're right. I'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Look, Brad, I've been trying to think of a way to tell you this. We're almost out of high school, this is our last year. I think we owe it to ourselves to be free, and meet some new people. Then, if we get back together, we'll know it's the right thing.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
First door on your left!
Don't strain yourself.
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
See you later.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
They were left over from the last shift.
What a guy.
Mark is a really nice boy...
Sure. Come on in.
Let's continue.
I didn't see you this morning.
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
What do you mean -- wuss? This girl is my exact type. It's her. Definitely her.
You tell me, Mike. What do I do?
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
Damone. It's Mark.
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
Fascinating.
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
Really?
He was hot, wasn't he?
No way! He just called him a dick.
It was okay.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
Not since November.
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
Yeah, like maybe never.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Yes.
Thank you, Desmond.  What's the reason for your truancy?
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
I know, everyone says that.
No problem.
I don't know. Wherever you want.
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Not at all.
Two more Cokes.
Today's April 16th. Damone never comes to school on April 16th.
John Bonham. The drummer for Led Zeppelin. He died a couple years ago. Every birthday he stays home and plays everything John Bonham ever recorded. It's like his own holiday.
You did the right thing. Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo.
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible. Can you have someone drive it around to the room?
WHAT?  What was that crazy bitch said to him?  There's a war on, man! People are being killed!
Not where we operate.
You know what I mean. We've done it before and we can damn well do it again!
Hell, no!
It's okay. He's admiring the shape of your skull.
Pay no attention to this swine. He can't handle the medicine. 
You whore!
I think he's lying to us. I could see it in his eyes.
Why what?
Where's the ether? This mescaline isn't working.
Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine. Watch out!... Why money? My name is Brinks; I was born... Born?
They didn't have any. They don't grow in the desert.
Look you better put that blade away and get your head straight. I have to put the car in the lot.
How about a check?
Do it! I want to get HIGHER!
Why worry? You'll like it. Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty- five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves...
Shit. I met her on the plane and I had all that acid.  You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink.
You'll go straight to the gas chamber. And even if you manage to beat that, they'll send you back to Nevada for Rape and Consentual Sodomy. She's got to go.
That's good. You can't be subtle in this town.
...and every one of them stacked naked...
They were all veterans.
Me?
It's gone too far.
Two glasses of ice water with ice.
Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once...
How far is Baker? I was hoping to stop there for lunch.
I'll try. I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time. I've heard a lot about it.
Part of what?
No! No! I swear to Jesus I never heard of that stuff!
What the fuck are you doing he's in there!
They'll get in! We'll all die!
We can't risk letting them in.
He's right, let's move. Be quiet and get to the exit. Pair up, grab the weapons.
They'll be back.
I don't wanna go home alone... I don't wanna see what might have...
We're going to get my little girl.
Where is everyone?
Where's that?
Come on, come on.
And the rest of 'em?
Easy.
It's in the basement, about a hundred yards long. It spits out on the backside of that hill down the way. There's a truck there.
What!? I'm not going down there again!
Buddy, I'm a full-blooded Chucktow. I can't think of a time my people haven't been takin' it dry. The fact that we are being eaten now, doesn't even faze me...  ...this is just another Tuesday.
No. You?
The door... on three.
Why don't you go check it out?
My truck.
What's in the back?
Well...
It'll calm your nerves. Works like a charm.
But --
Uh huh, now wiggle that sweet little ass over here and sit on Daddy's face, I wanna do some appraising.
What?
Covered.
Whoa!
They're probably on to the next buffet by now. There's a retirement home up the road. They'd be easy.
What the hell's going on here!?
Clear!
Well, we are one miracle short tonight. So, just guard the stairs?
There's a bomb shelter over in Durant, by the IGA, on First. You all know where that is?
Am I too heavy for you?
As long as it's dark, they're around. They hide, wait for you to drop your guard, and then attack.
Everyone take a role. Let's prepare the guns, ammo and whatever else we can scare up. We also need to help the hurt so we can move them on our ultimate exit outta here.  So, who's going into the basement with me?
I'm done drinking. That's it. Just Church and grocery stores. Nothin' else.
YOU'LL HIT US!
They'll tear this place down within the hour.
And the last one is the...
That's fine.
All right.
I think --
Thank you --
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
I'm not!
Thank you.
Huh.
In my eyes, officer.
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
Showdown.
Dick, we need some time apart --
The hearing's tomorrow. If she gets out legally, they can't come after her.
No. Never.
Thanks, Dad.
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
I have a right to talk to her. She's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why I've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers! They'll lead you safely down the mountain...
Fifteen.
I wouldn't miss it.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he's running for Congress here.
Yeah, well --
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
He wouldn't play ball. What can I tell ya... it's done.  Anyway, I didn't want to be next, so I skipped town; came down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job.  I'm sort of a non-gentleman's non- gentleman.  How d'ya like the camouflage?
Forget it.
I don't have what they want, Harry.  Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
The hell you will, Harry York.
Jesus, Frances, how'd you find me?
Frances...
You've looked a whole lot better. C'mon.
That sure looks like fun...  You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Frances, you're fulla drugs. You don't know what you're saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your mother thinks you're crazy and she'll keep on thinking it as long as it suits her.
Yeah? She's a shark, Frances. I'm not taking you there, and that's that!
No. To thoroughbreds.
What's that?
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
I got your number, Mister Man.
Who?
Oh Harry...
Yeah. I don't know.
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
How did I look?
Why do you say that?
I'm not sure.
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Run!
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Fine!
'Golden Boy.'
I know, but I'm not seeing it. It's there, Frances, the fire is there, but it's not coming through. You're lazy --
Yes, you win them, you bring them into your heart, touch them, but you don't set them on fire!
Your big speech?
You got it.
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Go on...
I'll be back.
Mama...?
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
But what -- 
Don't I know you?
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
It ain't for lack of trying.
I see.
Stay calm, please.
You're telling me you feel guilty.
Yeah?
Then why weep for him?
Better that way... for me.
Worse.
Yes. Very close
You speak.
How did you find me?
I see it before me.
There was something at work in my soul which I do not understand.
We'd travel north, my bride and I. To the furthest reaches of the Pole, where no man has ever set foot. There we would live out our lives. Together.  No human eye would ever see us again. This I vow.
What does it matter? She'll live again. You'll make her.
She's not for you.
So have I
Elizabeth. If it's true, travel into Germany would be banned. You'd never get near Ingolstadt.  Besides, they're only rumors.
Fine.
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left.  He's coming home to marry me.
It's far too late for him to still be out.
Quite a send-off, isn't it?
To be the best there ever was. To push our knowledge beyond our dreams... to eradicate disease and pestilence... to purge mankind of ignorance and fear...
Not as weak as I.
They knew the risks when they signed on. I've come too far to turn back now.
Do you foresee this happening in our lifetimes?
Oh God.
These are exciting times, Henry. We're entering an era of amazing breakthroughs. Look at Edward Jenner. He wasn't content to bleed people with leeches, he pioneered a new frontier of thought
But you haven't listened, Never in history has so much seemed possible. We're on the verge of answers undreamt of... but only if we have the courage to ask the questions.
Thank you, Henry.
And is it true, Miss Moritz, that you love Victor Frankenstein? That your heart was broken?  Answer the question. Do you love Victor Frankenstein?
Is it also not true that you murdered his brother William in a misdirected crime of passion?
You have a way of provoking his.  I've been watching you. You seem impatient with your studies.
You disdain accepted wisdom?
But the possibilities. Combining ancient knowledge with new? Something like this could change our fundamental views!
The strain was evident.
Are you a physician?
Would-be. I'm plagued with my share of difficulties just at the moment.
You know of it?
Bill -- Bill -- Bill is out there...
Push on this side. Alice, this is Jack, Marcie and Ned. Push.
You told her to sweep the courts.
Oh, thanks. I wish I could spend more time at it.
Thanks, Alice.
Not if they're where I think they are.
Absolutely.
Can't hear anything through that wind and rain.
Wet. I don't know.
Oh, you...
Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.
I need you so much, Claudette.
Where'd you get that stuff?
Here we go.
Don't get up. Take a second...
A short somewhere.
God, but I love that sexy talk.
Whatever you make yourself.
That was the telephone.
Whassamatta?
Girls can't be cowboys.
Frankly, Scarlet, I don't give a damn!
That's thirty percent.
Oh, that's just my daughter in the bathroom.
Well, because you picked that place out of a hat, my brother's dead now. And this girl's family's dead.
They're gonna kill her anyway. At least now with all these cops we've got a fighting chance.
If trusting you means trusting those fuckin' killers, I can't do that. If you don't tell the cops, I will.
To keep the daylight out! This is where they sleep! Get to the door!
He's my son.
Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.
What's this about, money?
That's not fuckin' that...  this is fuckin' this.  Go sit over there.
Good.  Your old man's all right, he just saved your life.
Auto wreck.
No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the car weren't great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she crashed, she died.
Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for about six hours before she passed on.
Then stop, 'cause that's where we're going.
Shit, I been to bars make this place look like a fuckin' 4-H club.
No, I do drink, I'm just not drinking now.
I'm gonna just sit here and drain this bottle. And when I've drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel now, I'm gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.
What's an official cross? Some piece of tin made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against vampires, it's not the cross itself, it's what the cross represents. The cross is a symbol of holiness.
Yep.
Scott?
Sure.
Where are you taking us?
What's in Mexico?
You asked me if I would --
Yes.
Anytime.
Later.
Feel this, real wood paneling. That's real wood, too, not that fake stuff.
Agent Chase, does it appear that they are heading for Mexico.
Knock yourself out.
This is a private club. You're not welcome.
He signaled the Ranger.
You believe me don't cha?
I'm not dead, but I'm definitely shot! I told you that bastard said, "Help us!"
No.
It's not your fault, it's her fault!
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yeah, I guess. I'm just a little fucked up.
That's what you look like.
No, Richie, what do I look like?
He needs our help!
Who's "we"?
Senator, they stand out on the public highway with telephoto lenses --
Your prerogative, Senator.
The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
So I'll get a fair shot?
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
I'm not sure what --
Smoke her.
Fuck me.
Did you hear?
I was one member of the investigating commission.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.  In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
My office will fill him in and help expedite.  Look forward to meeting you at the proper time.  Jumping off now...
Yes, dear.
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire.  Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him.  He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
I'm sure it is.
Fuck.  Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over.
She's a women, and that's why you're ridin' her bareback.
I oughtta report you.
What "all females"?  If I'm the only --
Maybe it's not my place to speculate on his private thoughts.  But I think the Chief knew that his way -- his world -- had come and gone.
You're the analyst for East China, O'Neil.  Analyze.
Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon?
Just like you would be.
I'm only trying to warn you in case --
Jordan.  You watch your ass.
What about him.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country.  He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
Yeah.  Me too.
And how do you know that?
Thanks, Wick.
Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit.
That's a good story.
Sure, sure.
Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask.
You heard me.  Move on.
Educate her, Pyro.
For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia.
Should I be afraid?
I think you're the liar.
Hey, hey, HEY.  No possibility.  You can't stay in here.  You can't sleep right next to me.
Listen, Sex Ape.  I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear.  Try a wrench on that thing.
FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for?
What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil?
Great. See ya then.
In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you.
Perfect! You wanted a story, well, baby, you got one.
Look, you want to make it up to your friend? Well if he's right, this is your chance.
It's the maintenance entrance. Runs along the side of the tunnel. When they repaired it last year I worked on a piece about it.
You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK.
It's good to see you, Nick.
What?
Most people don't.
I got pretty close.
Well what the hell did you think was going to happen?
I know a way. I know how you can get a message out of here.
Oh, just some insurance guy.
Speak of the devil.
He's scum! As far as he's concerned you're just a pair of breasts that talk.
Nick Tatopoulos.
Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue?
Five bucks.
It's your choice.
Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey?
Ah, Elsie Chapman, paleontologist.
I don't think so.
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You will have to go and get help!
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put land mines in them, bombs, I don't know, just make sure that goddamned thing doesn't leave the island!
They are with me!
We have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.
It happened so fast no one knew what hit them 'til is was over.
We're sending divers into the river now to retrieve the body.
Thanks.
Why are you telling this to me?
I am not permitted to speak of such things.
Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific.
Makes us look more American.
It's okay. I know her.
Well good, that's very... nice.
Is that the bathroom?
COME IN PROTECTOR... PROTECTOR...
What's the scale?  Is that ten miles? A hundred miles?
You go first! There's no time!
No time to worry about that, Alex. Tommy, let's get this thing slowed down... Gwen, see if you can calculate the impact point. Guy, cet down to deck C and make sure tne injured are secured. Also lets-
Oh, and did you hear he booked another fan appearance without us?
No, Jason, that's a wrap!  There's nothing to think about!
You have a better plan, Alex?
Dear God.... How did I come to this?
The ships are gaining...
It doesn't make sense... Surely they could have fortified the compound against those creatures...
No I didn't.
No time for pleasantries, Kyle. We have a level five emergency. The Commander needs us to get him to the core and shut it down before it overloads.
You've got the utility systems walkthrough, right?
We accidently traded Vox units when we bumped into each other on Saturday.
My cousin's boyfriend's sister went out with the screenwriter. His favorite movie is the Omegaman.  He's seen it 13 times...
Berithium lava coming through. Use the handholds above you.
Guys, we're sustaining structural damage!...
The enemy is matching velocity.
No, we don't have an extra Beryllium sphere.
Listen, I'll go in, create a distraction. have this...  may be able to hold them back long enough for the aliens to escape.
Jason, are we doing Episode 31 or not?
We're doing episode 31?
We made it. Commander, we made it.'
How much of a nothing? Not enough to split five ways kind of a nothing?
One minute   I'm -  Hey, I'm dressing.'
Only answers to me.
Let me think. I need time to think.
No, I don't think so... Wait. They're not but...  Something is.  Oh my god.
Right.
Because it was on the show!
I see them!  I see them! RD STREET	PASADENA 57
Deliver the device now or I will destroy your ship.
You have ten seconds.
Stop, please! I don't know!
Please, don't hurt them, it's not their fault. I'm not the Commander, I don't know anything.
Our dimwitted friends don't understand the concept of acting. They have no theater, no imagination these scientists.
Yes... You understand THAT, don't you, Mathesar?...
This is embarrassing, really.   I shan't tell this story when I return home.
Right, If this is about the thing tomorrow you can hammer out the details with my agent, but make sure I have a limo from my house, they jammed me into a Toyota the last time I did one of these
Home.
Long live Theramini.  Take a left here?
Oh, I don't think so. I gave him both barrels.
I would but I am REALLY running late and the 134's a parking lot after 2:00.  But listen, the guy gives you any more trouble, just give a call...
Thanks
It was a lot of fun. You kids are great.
Well... Sort of...
And determination.
I think we're going to exit the space port.
They designed the ship from watching you. So... Take her out, Lieutenant...
Why don't you just turn it on and see?
It's as far as it goes!
Okay, let's go.
Good work, Tommy.  Let's go!
It's a ROCK. It doesn't HAVE vulnerable spots!
Jason? What about me? What do I do?
Pedal to the metal...
But sir, my MEN. The core implosion is not reversible...
Hmmm... she's beneath me, I'm afraid.
Congress is talking -- openly -- about replacing you with Lee.
We're so damned important!  Look at us -- Nathanael, you were a horse- shoer, Benedict, before this?
That can't be.
Cut those men down.  Congress is pushing ahead with your court-martial.  Benedict, trust me to handle this.
Tell Mrs. Washington I am compelled to stay a while longer.
You are never, never to touch my guns!  Do you understand!?
That you would have known you can trust me.
Because they have hardly any uniforms, they designate officers with colored ribbons.  My lord.
The British!  These men cannot stand against them!
That's Greene.  He's supporting our reconsolidation.
To learn to shoot cannon?
Colonel Hamilton.  Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north.  I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair?  Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!?  You realize what would happen if this fort fell?  The whole Hudson would be open to them!
March on Philadelphia!  Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war!  Get them all!  Sweep them aside!
I'm not sure.
As does your ability, Horatio.  We must talk further, when it's more convenient.
Is that where our meat and boots and uniforms and muskets went?
I tell you every damned place I go the man is adored!  "General Washington!  Champion of Trenton! Savior of the Republic!"  And you should hear the way people are deprecating Congress!
It's the political 'cost of doing business', George.
A ground swell-Christian movement, George, you see?
To assert the rights of our founding fathers!  This country was colonized by Christians!  This shall become a Christian revolution.  Surely as a good Christian you understand that!
Well, I shall deny him to you!  He is evil on earth!
Uh... none just now, but...
I am.  Then, I understand you too serve without salary.  You know, since your charming little victories at Trenton and Princeton, the French court is softening.  I expect any time now a ship load of supplies...
Muskets and uniforms and Bayonets.
Don't be ridiculous, of course that won't happen.
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
I think I heard that.
Come out and meet my soldiers. They're good people.
We're leaving them?
You don't believe I can fight from a sense of duty and patriotism?
Then, maybe I do see what you're after -- perhaps... you get to chose again...
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see?  Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
I think I will disappoint you.
I see...
An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
They all sound big at the talking stage.
I seen it, but I don't believe it. Says Harry shot Ronnie five times. Four to the chest and one through his foot.
Into air bags. There's no cushion under what you're doing. I'm out of it, Cat. I'm done.
Just do what I told you and meet me back here at midnight.
No. What's this?
I gave him a key to a locker that had the money in it.
Because there were a zillion DEA guys hanging around the terminal.
Harry, let me answer that.
It's what he said, I'm his associate.
What about her?
There's nothin' to know. You have an idea, you write down what you wanna say. Then you get somebody to add in the commas and shit where they belong, if you aren't positive yourself. Maybe fix up the spelling where you have some tricky words... although I've seen scripts where I know words weren't spelled right and there was hardly any commas in it at all. So I don't think it's too important. Anyway, you come to the last page you write in 'Fade out' and that's the end, you're done.
Lemme see if I got this right, you break into Karen Flores' house, ask me for three hundred grand, doesn't even belong to you?
Gimme an hour.
In the can. That the money?
I can't do it.
Yeah, I hear you bagged Martin Weir for Mr. Lovejoy.
It's not the kind of thing you do.
Okay. So who are you?
Never heard of him.
Look at me, Ray.
Ray Barboni. From Miami.
I'm in the movie business.
I want you to keep looking right here, okay?
You know Dick Allen, Mesa's Casino?
You gonna get rough now, threaten me? I make good by tomorrow or get my legs broken?
Fuckin' basketball game.
They always paid.
Who's the star?
Harry, I probably know 'em better than you do.
They'll be looking at you. They don't know who you are.
You're kidding, right?
I don't know, maybe I wasn't clear. But I thought... I told you to keep your mouth shut.
His shrink's trainer.
Yeah, he wants us to talk to Buddy, set up a meeting.
I found him.
Who?
Ask your man here.
One of mine?
With what? Wiseguy money?
Yeah, but you haven't found him yet.  The guy took off for Las Vegas.
It's not that simple. You have to be careful. There's another guy that comes along, a hard-on you owe some money to. A mob guy. Wants to take you out anyway, on account of a past situation.
At eighteen percent, okay? And don't ask me no more fuckin' questions. I'm leaving.
I know who he works for. Where's your phone.
I know what a vig is.
...That's what we finally decided.
I married Martin. That was a full- time job.
He must mean after "Slime Creature 3".
Don't go out of your way.
How 'bout Get Shorty? Except that isn't a movie. That's real life.
Yeah. There's a girl in it now.
Whichever. Let's talk about it tomorrow.
What happened?
You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
I'm thinking about producing.
I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
Whatta you mean, whose point of view; The audience's point of view.
Yeah, me too. He was a helluva good writer. And I would know. I discovered him. Made him what he was.
No. But now that you mention it, I did talk to a handsome executive at Paramount the other day... who just happened to get his hands on the script.
Harry -–
He's telling me an idea for a movie. It's not bad so far.  Sit down, have a drink.  Tell Karen, let's see what she thinks.
That's where you got the idea?
Yeah, that's what we need. More agents.
No problem. You go on off to bed.
Shylock?
Hello, Martin.
Yeah, Karen knows him.
Arctic Warrior, passenger vessel Chimera was lost at sea day two month two year one nine five three.  Over.
Roger that, North Island. Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over and out.
Take it easy, Dodge. It's only a piece of metal.
Morning, skipper.
She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it.
Lemme see, was that before or after the oil fire?
Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow.
Gimme a break.
Why not?
Sounds reasonable.
I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
A salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. It's ours.
It looks like it.
What is it?
With all due respect, skipper.  Part of that up there's mine. I'd kinda like to have a little say in what happens to it.
You smashed it!
You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday.
Conveniently enough for you.
Right.
Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps?
He'd let you off at the nearest port, that's for sure.
Because of the gold.
Nothing. Let's get outa here.
They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away.
Maybe. But there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.
The guy. He just came this way.
I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy.
Possibly false. Hence the IMA record of being lost at sea. I don't think mutiny's out of the question here.
But, who -- ?
But where's the damage?
If it was a ship she hit.
Let 'em ask. This ship's legally ours now.
Hey.
Never mind. Before your time.  I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.
Maybe it was one of them did the handy work on those Greeks.
Victims of what?
Epps, over.
He's not on deck and I can't raise him on the radio.
Right here.
Maybe it was more than that.
Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him.
Go.
There's a large vessel out about ten miles to the north-west.
So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before.
And look what happened.
A what?
Must've heard something below deck and went down to check it out.
Leave it.
You think whoever did this is reasonable?
Fine with me.
Whyn't you mind your own business, chief.
You pump it out and re-seam the hull, she'll be good as new.
Fifteen, at the most.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
It's tough to find a good job without any kind of training.
How should I know?
Who?
She understands what you're going through and she really wants to help you. She says that job at Computer Station is still available if you want it.
But I can't --
Uh, no. I missed that one. But what do I know? I like Laurel and Hardy movies.
Please tell me it isn't that teenager!
I can't believe this! I thought at the very least a guy like you would never pull this kind of shit on me!
Help me what?
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
Look, I already told you I'm not going to give you a ride.
No.
Can I come in?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Then why do you hate me so much?
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
What?
Why?
How perfect.
Just look at them!
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
God, it's so totally pathetic.
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
We should follow him home.
Gross!
Forget it, I can't explain it...
What, is she black now?
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Let's go hassle Josh.
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
Everybody's too stupid!
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
Where?
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Which one?
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
We were such desperate sluts back then.
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
What are you talking about? Who?
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
Well, we won't keep you.
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
That's okay...
Seymour does.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
I know it's over, asshole, I --
That tape sucked, by the way!
Yes.
You're late, asshole.
Hey, where are you going?
What?
I don't have anything after about 1935. I may have one Hindu 78 from the twenties in my collection, but it's not really for sale. I don't really collect "foreign."
Sure, I guess.
Nah, it's not so great. Here's the one I'd recommend.
The Skip James record? Yeah, that's a masterpiece. There are no other records like that! I actually have the original 78 of it in my collection. It's one of maybe five known copies.
Watch my stuff.
I... I didn't think you would have any interest in this get together... I mean if you had told me you were coming I would have warned you -- it's not like a real party or anything.
Yeah, well sure... you can if you want to... it's just I don't want all these guys in there at once... you know...
Please... go ahead and kill me! This stuff doesn't make you happy, believe me.
Oh, right...
I don't know, what kind of question is that? I mean it's totally irrelevant because a girl like that would never be caught dead with me...
Shh!
C'mon, Seymour, please?
That thing is just so shrill and piercing and loud - it's like someone jabbing me in the face!  KFTO comin' atchya on this beautiful evening...
Yeah, well it's simple for everybody else - give 'em a Big Mac and a pair of Nikes and they're happy! I just can't relate to 99.9% of humanity.
But it's not totally hopeless for you... I've had it. I don't even have the energy to try anymore.  You should make sure you do the exact opposite of everything I do so you don't end up like me...
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
If you don't mind my asking -- why do you care so much if I get a date or not?
What?... Oh that... I borrowed that from work about fifteen years ago... I guess it's mine now.
You work at Cook's Chicken?
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
No, in a lot of ways things are better now... I dunno... it's complicated. Everybody still hates each other, but they know how to hide it better, or something...
That's the spirit!
Oh yeah?
Who knows?
How can you be so sure?
It's just that, well, you know, Dana just got out of a really bad relationship and I don't want to give her the wrong idea... you know...
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
Can you at least let me in?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
But, I...
Forget it, there's no way... find some other poor sucker to abuse.
He has every reason to freak out -- this is a totally fucked-up thing to do to somebody!
I wish I could see him.
It's a "found object"... that's when an artist takes an ordinary object and places it in an artistic context and thus it becomes art.
I guess I see the teacup as a symbol for womanhood, because of tea parties in the olden days, but instead of tea I was trying to kind of confront people with this... like...
Right, exactly!
Are you sure she wasn't there?  Maybe she was just hiding from you.
He'll replace you, too- that's all you really care about.
As are they all.
But I have in India- every country presents problems.
Don't they, though?
Yes he is.
In point of fact, it didn't.  But I'm convinced the theory is sound.
All they'll bring is more chaos and we've plenty of that already- and if they come in, word will get out- and what happens to your knighthood then?
Karim will have to show me where it happened. And of course, I'll need the donkey.  With any luck, I'll sort it out tonight. 
-please- you needn't be so graphic-
I suppose I could answer you. I suppose I could explain that the place is so inviting, what with the smell of blood and flesh, that they have to strike. It's even possible that I tell you I found some fresh paw marks around back which means they're already contemplating feasting here.  But I don't want to answer you because when you question me you are really saying that I don't have the least idea what I am doing, that I am nothing but an incompetent, that I am a fool.  Anyone who finds me a fool, please say so now.
We're not much good at goodbyes, Helena.
What if there are complications?-
The females are bigger- only animal here like that- have to be or they wouldn't survive because the males eat the young.
Just that they fart through their mouths.  Must make kissing something of a gamble.
Have you got that in writing? 
And anxious to get started.  What is this, mostly malaria?
We know three things about man-eaters. First, they always return to where they've attacked before. Second, they're always old- they can't catch other animals so they turn to us. And third, they're always alone- they've been cast out by their pride because they can't keep up.
You mean nobody died?
Nonsense- Samuel would have done something. 
No, but you do-  -see, you were needed after all.  And fifty warriors at the camp before dawn.
Has it ever done that before?
Don't they have to be?...
The most of any lions... a hundred...?  Probably more.  Johnny...?
Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. 
Thank you, Samuel.
I don't believe you had a mother. 
Four should do it.
Actually, I'm not eating lunch today.  I have an appointment.  In fact, I'd better go.
Hello, Dana.  I happened to be in the neighborhood and I thought I'd stop by to see if everything's all right with you -- you know, with the blackout and everything? Are you okay?  Is the baby all right?
We don't have a relationship.
Does he ever mention me?
Okay, let's take a look.
You are personally responsible.  If I can get conjugal rights, will you visit me at Sing Sing?
I didn't paint it.  I'm just cleaning it. It's an original Ver Meer.  It's worth about ten million dollars.
As a matter of fact, I stopped by to tell you that I haven't forgotten your problem and that we're still on the case.
Yeah, it's not the kind of thing you'd want to hang in the rec room.  You know what it needs?  A fluffy little white kitten in the corner.
I don't know what to do anymore.
Really?  And how would we handle the sleeping arrangements?
I put them in your hamper.  I thought they were dirty.
I want to stop getting involved with men who aren't good for me.
Why do you say things like that?  You're so much better than you know.
Your alien had a room in the Holiday Inn?
Now you're talking.
How are you?  What's that you're working on, Johnny?
Well, I'd make an exception in this case if I were you.
I know.
Yes, the scourge --
-- the sorrow --
Yes.
Hi, it's really great to meet you guys.  I know this sounds weird but once I had a dream that my grandfather was standing at the foot of my bed, but I knew it was impossible because he died and he started to tell me that --
Well, I think it's important for people to know that the world is in danger.
No, I guess I'm just saying that shit happens and somebody has to deal with it.
Yeah, you would.  Is that for personal or professional reasons?
They love you, Lib.  Keep it up.
I'm worried.  The vibrations could shake her to pieces.  We should have padded her feet.
Why don't we try the Giga-meter?
It may be ebbing and flowing from some tidal source.
And we're the ...
That's it.  It's on the bottom.
You mean this stuff actually feeds on 'bad vibes'?
And it's all flowing toward the museum.
There's something very familiar about this painting.
Oh, just checking something for an old friend.
Who?  Just -- someone we know.
Aaah!  Nobody!  I can't tell you!
Okay, let's heat 'em up!
I'm Peter --
I'll get one more reading.
You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license.
We're almost there, Lib.  Step on it.
No, I just thought --
Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys.
Don't you see?  It's the slime.  That stuff is like pure, concentrated evil.
You think all those predictions about the world coming to an end in the 1990s are true?
I don't know.  It probably would've been the same.
No thanks, Louis.  I'm really tired.  I've been rehearsing all morning.
I thought I turned it off.  I guess I forgot.
I am Zuul.
Thanks.  What's in there?
What?
Well, let's check it out.
I know.  You're quite a celebrity these days.  Are you here because you have info ... about my case?
The "stiff?"  He happens to be one of the finest musicians in the world and a wonderful man.
I'll cancel the reservation,  I found the name "Zuul" in ...  The Roylance Guide to Secret Societies and Sects.  I don't suppose you've  read it.
I'll pick you up at your place.  I'll bring along the Roylance Guide -- we can read after we eat.
I am Zuul.  I am the Gatekeeper.
Really?  Can't wait to meet him.  As long as we're waiting for him, I'd really like to try something with you -- in the bedroom.
Well, I'll just use it for a while and get it right back to you.
I am Zuul.  I am ...
Dr. Venkman, we believe that the purpose of science is to serve mankind.  You, however, seem to regard science as some kind of "dodge" or "hustle."  Your theories are the worst kind of popular tripe, your methods are sloppy and your conclusions are highly questionable.  You're a poor scientist, Dr. Venkman, and you have no place in this department or in this University.
Yes.  I'm Dr. Venkman and this is Dr. Stantz.
Die in what sense?
I don't care.  I see us as tiny parts of a vast organism, like two bacteria living on a rotting speck of dust floating in an infinite void.
What calls?
Here are tonight's calls.
The EPA?  What's he want?
You could say that.
A square?
You volunteered, didn't you?  Aren't we paying you for this?
Were you recently in the bathroom?
I'm always serious.
She's telling the truth -- or at least she thinks she is.
Didn't see anything,  Didn't get anything. Nice girl - no ghost.  I'm starting to worry.  You said your graph was pointing to something big.  You told me things were going to start popping.
If you turn that thing off we won't be responsible for the consequences.
She said he was "the Destructor."
And look at this, Peter  Cold-riveted girders with selenium cores.
Peter, at 1:40 this afternoon at the main branch of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue, ten people witnessed a free-roaming, vaporous, full-torso apparition.  It blew books from shelves at twenty feet away.  Scared the socks off some poor librarian.
No, this one's for real, Peter.  Spengler went down there and took some PKE readings. Right off the top of the scale.  Buried the needle.  We're close this time. I can feel it.
What do we do now?
Hey, Lady?  Lady!  Can you talk?  Who are you?   This is not working.  Think of something else.
Let me tell you, Ray, everything in life happens for a reason.  Call it fate, call it luck, Karma, whatever.  I think we were destined to get kicked out of there.
But at nineteen percent interest!  You didn't even bargain with the guy.
Maybe.  But no one ever advertised before.
It wasn't a date.  It was an investigation.
So far all we got is a shit smell on the twelfth floor and we almost fried a Puerto Rican bellboy.
Forget the trapping!  Just blast him!
The Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man!  He was on all the packages we used to buy when I was a kid.  We used to roast Stay-Puft marshmallows at Camp Waconda!
Uh ... Oh these are blueprints of the structural ironwork in Dana Barrett's apartment building ... And they're most unusual.
And the seas would boil ...
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
I'm sure, I don't know.
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
Taking my pleasure.  Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother.  The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Gladly Caesar.
We have to stop the Germans now!
I'll nose around...
That's their job, isn't it?  To argue.  So, I think my case will be long on talk and short on action.
That makes his birth sign... Virgo! Why that's the sign of a little girl!  Can you tell my readers more about your star-crossed connection with Emperor Commodus?
I need to give you my word when yours is worth nothing?
You don't know how wrong you are.
Narcissus!  Terrified?  You?  The only thing he's scared of is me.
I don't believe that.  He's got the best doctor in the world and a will of iron.  You know we're preparing for a full-blown invasion of Germany.
Yours will do!
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children?  The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
The fort helps position us for a final invasion in the spring when they're most vulnerable.
I will, Marcus.  But you're going to be well enough to direct it yourself.
So I understand.
They fear me.
I'll do anything in my power to help you restore the Republic but I can't be that power.
Well, we can try...
I can't let you do that.
The 'people'?, listen to the people, they know what they want:  A government that gives them what they need and doesn't bother them with messy thoughts of issues.  You know, messy... thinking.  They want a dictator!  As far as the children, there is only one thing that every Roman child dreams of:  being you! A famous gladiator!
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
Greeks?
I can see that...
Who else?  I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome!  Or for the glory of you!
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
No!
You are to be killed, exactly. They'll give you a sporting chance, but just enough to make your murder... entertaining.  Romans like to mix their metaphors:  laughter with their executions, you know?  If you survive, though, you will become a gladiator.  A gladiator at least gets a fair fight.
Chain him.
I didn't get killed and everyone else did.
So I pretend I'm dead.  You get gold, what do I get?
As, what, 'The Galloping Gladiator?!'
On you!  Of course!  You are my bravest fighter -- the best fighter I have ever seen!
I can really rape them on this!  Can I at least tell them you'll think about it?
I'll do it!  Sure as there's shit in the Tiber we're all going to die, but for you -- anything!
Are you mad?  With all this unrest the Colosseum will be open day and night!  Anyway, I'm not political, I'm in the entertainment business.
Yes.
I'm sorry I took you in there.
But, Elaine --
No, I couldn't.
Wait a minute.
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Get out of here.
At the Zoo.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Did you say rape her?
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
My belt.
I don't know.
No.
I don't know.
Yes.
I'll think about it.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
No, Benjamin.
Shhhh.
What?
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Mr. McQuire.
Yes, sir.
Not exactly.
I am going to call the police now.
What?
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
What do you mean?
What?
Like what?
So?
All right. Now finish your drink.
Yes.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
I've got to go.
Of course.
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
What?
I haven't. No.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then.  If you'll excuse me.
Benjamin.
Benjamin.
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Are you kidding?
If you want.
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Well what do you want to talk about?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
There!
I walk out.
What?
Thank you.
See if you can guess.
Art.
Kind of.
How do you think.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
Why not?
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
But if it's sickening for you --
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Very good, sir.
When I go off?
Goodnight.
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
About an hour ago.
About what?
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
Ben -- how old are you now?
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
You'll never be young again.
Ben, can I say something to you?
Quite a while.
Yes, sir.
Oh yes.
No, it's not --
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
Don't shout at me, Ben.
Yes, I can.
I'd like to discuss this.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
That what he says. Right?
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it.  Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the -- 
The pearls are in her room.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
With the pearls?
Not with strangers.
Dictation.  You know...
No -- why? -- should I?
Very little.
Where downstairs?
Sorry.
Chasing what?
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
For tonight. 
What do you want here?
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone. 
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear -- 
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
I know.
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
Don't.
Not at all, sir. 
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Yes, quite.
A little strange, Baron.
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just --  Well -- well --
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
No -- not at all.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
I thought she was splendid!
That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
Nobody, Doctor.
You're tired. I can see that.
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Everything?
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute!  We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
You don't understand that do you?
What?
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock. 
Well?
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Why not?
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
All you have to do is phone for it.
And I said we didn't.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
You've decided against the merger?
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.  You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester. 
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce...  ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Next week.
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told.  Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
He likes to play the great man.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
Goodnight, Suzette.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Why not?
You haven't time.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
The troupe, the scenery, everything -- all on board, waiting. You have a rehearsal in Vienna tomorrow morning. Come, Madam, are you mad?
No news yet?
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
Well -- gentlemen.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
On the square, huh? And how are you making out these days? Stealing much?
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
Well, you can tell them I said they're right.  I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
I like you, too.
Hah.
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
Goody!
So here we are!
I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had moments I was worried.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
But they must be! They cut glass!
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
That's just the first year. If you aren't worth a lot more than that the second year, I'll kick you out. What do you say?
Oh, sure. Fine.
Perk.
The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
You don't have the stomach for it.
I pay my debts.
I've really got to --
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
As though you do what I say.
This way's perfect.
You've already made a start. Doesn't look that clean, though.
Don't be sorry. You're not taking it.
You must have some money.
Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.
Not very good!
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
I don't?
My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money. She's waiting.
Are you sure?
No, baby. Come to Mama.
You already went back to work.
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
And when he got serious?
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just... 
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
What?
No! Because I --
For Christ's sake, why not?
Yes?
Well, mostly, I don't believe it.
One thing I have to caution you about. A gunshot wound...
Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.
That don't match either of the victim's.
Unable to escape, she turns and attacks the killer, but doesn't connect.
Broken blood vessels on her right forearm.
It's Blake.  How do you feel about Wisconsin?
I'd prefer you didn't.  I'm very busy.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again.  Thanks for your concern.  Goodbye.
Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Who are you, the serial killer police?  What difference does it make?
My blood pleasure.  You scared the hell out of me.
You sure?
Nothing's missing?
Betcha' didn't predict that.
Just forget it...
Will, sit down...
John...
I came to see you.
Yeah.
I know.  I'm really, really sorry, Miss Tate.  Please let me keep the job... it's the only way I can afford to stay here.
Who?!
What?
Oh, right.  Sorry.
Can't it wait till Monday?  I thought maybe we could dance...  I'm very light of my feet.
Big time.  And news travels fast. Wouldn't be surprised if the whole school knows about this one by tonight.
Wasn't scaring the hell out of me once today enough?!
Another episode of 'Daddy Knows Best' at the Strode house.
We were worried about you guys so we left early to see if you were --
Relax.  Everything's cool.  Didn't I tell you Harry would be here?
The voice man!  He's here!
But I've seen him!
You can't expect us to stay here --
Danny!!!
Lock the doors and call your husband. Get your family as far away from Haddonfield as possible.
Mrs. Strode, Michael Myers is here to kill his family.  And he won't stop until you are all destroyed.  I only thank God that I found you before he did.
It's ... Michael ...  ... Michael Myers!
No, please listen!  They're coming ... coming for me and my baby.
Danny, go downstairs -- Now!
Him.
Why would anyone want to kill an innocent baby?
It's a rune ... Thorn.
'When applied directly to another person, Thorn could be used to call upon them confusion and destruction -- to literally visit them with the Devil.'
Kara, no!
That's the whole idea of living in the country.  I thrive on the seclusion.
You should know that it's not wise to play Halloween pranks on me.
You don't know that for sure.  It could have been anyone.  A practical joke. Kids.
It was you.
Dr. Loomis, thank God you're here.  You heard her, didn't you?  It was Jamie.
Only me --  -- and Dr. Wynn.
Didn't recognize you.
Home.  Jesus.  I'm like this.  Home!
How all the magazines show tits today.
Tell them yourself!
I sure didn't expect her to drop dead.
Really?
Sorry.
Of course!  Not only go to it but go to it in full uniform!  Rent a uniform!
I dunno. You know.  I used to really love that Alice. Do you know that?
If what?
What?
It would have been fun to see you drop your rifle and run the first time an elephant charged us.
You're hollow, like a woman.
He can shoot!  He can hold his ground!  He can attack!  You're in your proper profession right now-- sucking up dirt for frumpish housewives, closet drunkards every one.
Out!
Dad was never in England?
"The sting."
Tell me that.
Dr. Woodly says he's seen hundreds of children permanently injured by football.  He says that when there's a war, everybody goes but football players.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.  It can't be. How embarrassing.
Sir?
She's a real heavy sleeper sometimes.
Penelope!
Damn.
Your mother and I do not wish to be disturbed for three full hours.
Nothing.
I think so, daughter.  How old are you?
A springbok, an oryx, a gemsbok--a gazelle.
Raw hamburger, please--and a whole onion.  I want to eat the onion like an apple.  Do you understand?
Did you ever daydream that you would one day meet a friendly millionaire?
Daughter--I love you very much.
Destiny often seems that way. You're going to marry me.
Give us time.
I don't know.  This is a new disease to me.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
We thought it was an emergency.
Buy yourself breakfast.  There we go.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
I have a brain.
What a honeymoon.
This is not a coy deception.  I do not want to be scrogged.  I want love.  I want tenderness.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Well, I can.  Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me.  I'm not a silly carhop any more.  Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would.  But I've been sensitized.  I have ideas now--and solid information.  I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
Yes.
No you're not!
If he wants to go.
It isn't a matter of liking.  It's a matter of getting used to death-- as a perfectly natural thing. Would you mind leaving?  No woman ever walks out on Harold Ryan, and then comes back--for anything.
Hope.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Sounds quite beautiful.
Like what?
Then you'd better fix your bayonet, because there aren't any bullets in the gun.
There it is.  Give it to me.
Hello, Mother.
Oh dear.
She still has just the one child-- the boy?
And what, exactly, is your relationship to Mrs. Ryan?
I came back.
Whose son this is, whose wife that is.  A fiancé is the most ridiculous appurtenance this household could have at this time.  Good night.
Are you've seen it work cures?
It's healer to killer.  Is that the same thing?
Now who's being cruel?
Yes--well--uh--that's another one of those statements which more or less automatically requires an apology.  Whenever you feel like it. It's sort of like turning off an alarm clock that's ringing loudly. Your apology turns off the alarm.
And terror, if you don't mind.
In any event, I will not beg for mercy.
No. WOODLY The magic root you gave me--I had it analyzed.  It was discovered by a Harvard botanist in 1893!  He explored your famous jungle for five years, armed with nothing but kindness, a talent for languages, and a pocketknife.
And the hell with it.  It was so tragically irrelevant, so preposterously misinformed.
Never.  For when you began to kill for the fun of it, you became the chief source of agony of mankind.
Oh God--you're really going to kill me. HAROLD It won't hurt as much as the sting of a bumblebee.  Heaven is very much like Paradise, they say. You'll like it there.
Thank God. HAROLD Crawl home.
It's trash now, like mine.
Jesus.
Well--I walked up to the front door. I was still alive.  Big surprise. I rang the doorbell, and old Mrs. Wheeler answered.  She had her Goddamn knitting.  I said, "Guess who?" She conked right out.
Yeah--cripes.  I never did get any sense out of Alice.  She found me holding up the old lady, dead as a mackerel.  It was a bitch.  You know--maybe Mrs. Wheeler was going to die then and there anyway, even if I'd been the paper boy.  Maybe not.  I dunno, boy.  That's civilian life for you.  Who knows what kills anybody?
Honey--Alcoholics Anonymous takes all the time I've got--and Harold Ryan is an individual I would rather forget.  He drove me to drink.  He drove his first two wives to drink.
Ja?
I don't care what she wears.
She doesn't care!  She's not married any more!  She's going to have fun!  I hope you have so much fun you can hardly stand it.  Dr. Woodly--I hope you make up even better jokes about my father than the ones you've said so far.
All my dreams have suddenly collapsed.  We did have a lot of laughs together, Penelope.
Stay home tonight!
If you have to go out with some guy--can't he be more like Dad?  Herb Shuttle and Norbert Woodly-- can't you do better than those two freaks?
You're the only woman he ever took out.
Still lives with his mother.
I was afraid to ask.
It's beautiful.
No.
That man is your father.
Shivers and sweats and groans.  His teeth chatter.  What'll we do?
I apologize.  But you didn't know him, and neither did I.  How's your asthma?
How's the fungus around your thumbnail?
He is my father.
Something happens to my confidence.
That's when I'll get my confidence back.
Yeah.
He ditched me.  He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
Before he started to run.  He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
You're saying no.
What's so wonderful if I lost the sale?  You poor kid.
What?
It is?
Why would you do that?
We've got to rescue him.
Oh--look at the poor, crucified violin, would you?
You fake!  You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon.  You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
That maid just quit.  The place is a mess.  You can start in the master bedroom.
Mozart plays shuffleboard.
Jack the Ripper plays shuffleboard.
Big threat. TV would ream you.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Are you going to stiff me?
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
The rate is a dollar per line, a dollar and a half bold face.
Overpowering?
Yes. I think it'll look better.
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
Yeah.
Three hundred?
Okay. My client pays for it anyway.
I don't drink, but you can go out.
She's dead.
At least I'm a growing person.
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what?  You can't even say it, can you?
'Sucking off.'
You and I, Niki, have very different ideas about sex.
You really believe all that?
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Why can't I meet him now?
On your own land?
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
Well, what do they know?
So then, Mr. Mast...
...What do you have to offer?
What do you mean?
I don't know.
You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
Research, my ass. I suppose these are the 'extra expenses' I've been paying for? And in the middle of the morning, too.
Get out.
Nah. They don't care about some faggot hustler. They're more interested in your daughter's health -- and yours. Like I am.
It's just a name.
Go home, pilgrim. There's nothing you can do. Forget this place. Start over.
What?
I was told that there were certain things that only Ratan could provide.
Let's go.
What?
I don't know. Look, man, if you're looking for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.
My secretary said you wanted to discuss a business proposition.
Film making can be pretty expensive...
Oh.  Why is it that you want to get into film financing?
It's cool. Why do you think I got in the movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?  Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?
Don't get me wrong. A couple years ago, I woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the Lord's been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones, small ones. Right now we're setting up a two hundred thousand dollar feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That way you don't have to share the profits. There's plenty of guys in town that'll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr... what was your name again?
Calm down, mister. You don't want to get the cops in here do you? You got a family?
Why don't you just go outdoors, mister? Cool off.
You never heard of that?
You're taking a big chance.
No, Andy. Don't know the kid.
'Was.' He and that shitheel Ratan went down to T-J. Maybe I shouldn't say that. Anyway, I hear he's back in Frisco now.
Yes, that's good planning. Tell me, are you a regular, Candy, in this computer club?
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
You too, Buster. Stand over here. Lady, you're in a heap of trouble. I have you down here for several violations; speeding, resisting arrest, driving without a license, driving a stolen vehicle, possession of a stolen tree... Where's the tree?
I see the eternal goddess of beauty and love. I see Aphrodite. The consummate woman.
Harold Chasen.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Eh, no.
Oh.
It's very interesting.
Maude???!
Eh, fine.
Yes. Very much.
That's really great.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
Certainly a new experience for me.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Is he all right?
No more revolts.
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
Yes. It's almost there.
It's all right.  It's organic.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
What was that?
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
It's so blue.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Yes. They're old friends.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
I don't care what people say.
Can't complain.
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Does that worry you?
Ah, yes.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
What about the draft?
I don't know.
I go to funerals.
Yes.
Yes.
No.  I'd have liked to.
War is not all black.
To pit your own life against another.
Well, I don't...
She took my head.
Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
Don't waste your tears. Look at him!
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
Yeah. The things you were talking about.
Are you crazy?
WHY?
Kyle, you don't have...
And what about you?
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
Yeah.
Story of my life.
You mean, outside... with her.
Red, I found something --
I dunno, maybe five seconds -- ow!
Oh -- you don't wanna know what I think. Topside, now.
What is it?
Ruins. Not rocks. The remains of Trondham Abbey. Built on an intersection of Ley Lines, the boundaries between our world and the other --
Air and sea backup. What's closest?
From where??!!
Spiritual advisor to the Romanovs.  In 1916, at a dinner in his honor, he was poisoned, shot, stabbed, clubbed, drowned and castrated.
I know where to find him. I'll get him back.
Don't worry. I'll get him soon enough --
"In the absence of light, darkness prevails." For there are things that go bump in the night, Agent Myers.  We are the ones who bump back.
You're doing fine.
Nah. I'll be around, Red, just back in the field.
Not so fast. He barely knows him --
I can live with that.
No. Don't --
No one ever helps me. It's my job.
Yes?
Not hungry.
Well. Is it long?? I'm going out, but --
I like that...
Coffee's warming me up.
You want to know -- Now -- ? Here? Red, white, whatever -- Guys are all the same.
What?
-- Section fifty-one. Step back.
What's the problem?
Hi.
We're leaving.
It's just a puzzle box.
To a man called Frank Cotton?
Stay the fuck away from me.
I have to speak to my father.
Oh Christ.
Kirsty?
Poor baby.
Hush now. It's all right Frank's here.
I'm sorry. Of course. You're very welcome.
Forget him.
Just help, will you? Please God, help me --
What do you want me to do.
Good.
Who?
What?
Hell...
I said no.
Like this? Look at me! LIKE THIS?
I have to see my father.
The best part of ten years.
You mean we're moving in?
No. I'm not.
So what's the argument?
Oh Christ. Julia...
Why not?
I cut myself.
Shit.
So damn stupid.
I'll be scarred for life.
Can I get you anything?
I've seen worse.
Fine.
Don't go upstairs.
I... suppose so, yes.
Do you care ?
That's right.
No.
I prefer the floor.
What's wrong?
Steve.
I said: I found a room.
I'm not going to change my mind, Dad.
What for, honey? You know we can look after you. You've made the gesture --
I've forgotten.
She's not like Mom. She's... I don't know... moody. I thought that was what you liked about her.
Sure.
What's the problem?
If there's a train.
Oh, I don't know. Up-tight. Frigid.
Oh no.
I beg your pardon?
Say it.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
Rob.  Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's.  Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins?  "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
Oh, so what's the point then?
Bullshit.  The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway.  Why not have a little fun?  Big fucking deal.
I wanna live with a musician.  She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
That's fucking great, Barry.  We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each.  Fantastic, Barry!
What do you mean, "what?"
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all.  Dick, did you hear that?
Ooh!  A kind of recent record!  Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
Let's pack it up.  We haven't had a customer in four hours.
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you?  You two have to stick together now.  Boners United.  United in getting some.
Suck my ass.
Barrytown.  Barrytown?  Is there no end to your arrogance?
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Haven't seen it.
No.  We need the gig.
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by.  They got sick of the Barry/Barrytown thing.  We're called SDM.  Sonic Death Monkey.
Oh yeah.  We got it.
I have all of the others.
Nothing.
Nothing.  I just prefer the other one.
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
We work there!
Anna Moss.  Mossy.  The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing.  Is she all green and furry?
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary.  That's all.
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what?  Why don't I just make you a tape?
Oh, hi.  Hi, Rob.
Well, I'll just make it for you.
The new Belle and Sebastian.  Like it?
Yeah.  I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up.  She's gone.  And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Fine.
Liz, hold on a second --  What?
-- FUCK OFF!
Conflict resolution is my job, Laura.
Come on, Rob.  My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
You really believe that?
Good.  So.  Is it my job?
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Fine.  One.
Just ask it!
Will you please just go?
Have you slept with him yet?
I don't have your number.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are.  You're running.  On the run.  You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
It was kind of funny.
That bad, eh?
Hey, how ya doin'?
I can't talk right now.
Mmnn.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
I don't want to go back.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
It's no joke.  I'm responsible for what happens, you know.  Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards.  I have to put down a deposit for the room.  I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
Not really.
I mean it.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
Not in love, exactly, but...
Right.  Okay, then.  Shall we go?
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Hey.  It's Liz.
You called this morning?
It's a crematorium.
What difference does it make?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
Yeah.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Well call her mother.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed.  Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Then what are you getting so upset about?
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
Mom!  For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married!  She is not that kind of girl!  To use a phrase.  That's not what happens now.
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
Sixty.
Nice.
Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral.  The father looked just like Richard.  Even had a mark on his cheek.
Yeah.
I've been trying to find somebody who knew him and any connections his family might have had with museums or historical societies.
The boy _died_?
You owe me.  Besides, I'm cute.
You'll be safe here.  He won't kill in a church.
That bothers you?
You are being foolish.
Richard Taupin has become cumbersome.  It would be best if he just disappeared.
The only real difficulty comes in changing over the ownership of property I've aquired.  That requires certain records and most importantly a personal appearance at the county seat in Gettysburg.  But that's where you come in.
Follow me.
At least.
A factor of age.
I see.
That would be difficult to explain.
What could possibly be worth all this murder and distruction.
What about that family in '31?
Empty.  And fear.  Fear of those that would kill you and fear of those that would love you.  It can never last, and in the end you always end up destroying both.
The inheritance.
I'm just curious.
Now there's a new topic.
You better have a warrant.  That's my notebook, you've got no right to be sticking your fingers into it.
Never take up poker, Detective.
You see that desk?  _Your_ desk?  You see the crap piled up on it?
What are you doing man?
-In nomine sanctus esperitu-
Juan Cid Romirez.  Chief surveyor and alchemist.
I was nearly killed.
Yes.  Always.
What?
This is madness!
No!
This is monstrous.  I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
That's mad.  Surely you don't take their word?
Far away.
Perhaps not.  You seem to have misplaced a private.  No doubt by now his head is stranger to his neck.
Finish yours?
You seem to understand a great deal.
If you wish to play games, Major.
I had no choice.
Figure she's with him?
Think we should call the local P.D. out there first?
How many came?
We learned he'd found the immigration notaries in Liverpool and traced them to New York.  Then he figured out the birth records in Church Hill...
Kahn?
Sit.
Head still secure to the neck.
What are you doing here?
Not tonight.  Tonight I have a drink with an old friend.
I've had a few more concerns.
You're wrong.
Are you here?
Should I care?
Yes.
No.
That's none of your business.
I presume it's a sword.
Your murder weapon?
A neighbor saw your car leave.
When may I expect the cleaners?
Hildy!
What's the idea of locking this?
Hello, Bensinger.
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
The Criminal Courts Building.
Hello, Bruce...
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
No -- she didn't.
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
No, you don't!
Give me the District Attorney's office.  I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary.  Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
What?!!
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Now you got me.
What for?
Oh, I'm sorry.
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
Hold on a minute.
Yes. Where is he?
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Give him the works.  Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Is he coming back here?
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
You -- you!!
You grey-haired old Judas!
I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean?
You got plenty of money?
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five.  Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. 
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
I think it is.
You said it!
Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen.
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Yes, sir.
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
I'll have it in a minute.
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
So do you what, you hoodoo!  And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
Yeah. I was never so tired in my life.
Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you?
I thought so, too.
What's the use of fighting, Hildy?
Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it?
Thanks. So long, Hildy!
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
Mother!
That man there!
Very simple, Earl.
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
They're not human!
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Ssh!
Never mind! Just play dead.
Shut up, you!
The reprieve for Earl Williams.
Who do you think!
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
I'll explain it tomorrow!
You're insane!
A very fine-looking women.
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it?
We want to see you.
I give that marriage six months.
She and Mollie were talking.
I think you hit him, Grandpa. He was limping when he ran off.
Very well, Grandpa.
You're much more convincing when you're making it up.
No, she didn't.
Bugger off.
Won't they have maps?
Would.
Ask her yourself.
We thought it was poison.
It's dinner time. It really is. Cross my heart.
...and six...
The land and the King are one, my son. If he stutters we falter. He's getting batter, and so are we.
We will, you will, for the rest of our lives?
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
Air-raid?
There is all right. This Hitter fellow. We've got to winkle him out. And get shot of some of our lot at the same time.
And I'm still just a lad myself.
What's that?
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
Half the time he's bluffing.
The ideas you get in your head.
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
It's not. It's happening to me.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
Wasn't it lovely?
How many of our class left? You and me out of twenty-eight.
It's just the wrench, Grace. It's for their sake.
...since I used to take you to the Proms?
Look after yourself, Grace.
Kids don't care. You're thinking of yourself.
I know you mean well.
Well! I'm not talking about Mac. He hasn't toughed me for ages. And not often ever. My life started when Mac went on nights.
Deadwood, is that what it's called? Cool, will you show us?
Huh... what cone?
Things like that get a lot bloodier than ya think.
Yeah, it won't take long and besides you sassy poodle girls will slow us down.
Baby! Stop!
Enjoy your last night...  ...where's Otis?
Who's your Daddy!
OK.
Almost there... are you in a hurry or something?
Aw, you ain't seen nothing yet.
Oh... yeah, he already left. We'll wait inside, come on.
No. There's a bunch a us 'round somewhere... I think Mamma's sleepin'. She sleeps a lot, now... do you want marshmallows?
A dead one.
OK, sorry... maybe the Great Pumpkin ate 'em up.
You know... a couple of queers.
I was just wondering, cause you got a pissy look about you... like a real pussy licking bitch.
Now, what makes you think that?
I'll bet you do... how much we owe ya...  ...Goober?
Great story Goober, how much?
Holy crap, thanks!
Y'all find us country people real funny like don't ya... well, God damn pack up the mule and sling me some grits, I'ze a gotta get me some schooling.
Oh yeah, I forgot about her. She was pretty hot.
Dude, talk about baggage, that ain't no carry-on shit, that's some heavy duty Samsonite shit.
I hope this place is cool. We could use something interesting to liven up chapter 12.
Wake up the chicks and bust out the camera awesome?
And the spare is safely sitting in Jerry's garage.
Jesus, you think she was really gonna cut you?
I suppose. I mean they're obviously all bonkers, but I guess they're harmless.
Lock the fucking doors.
Where ya headed?
There's a dog in the road.
Quiet.
Hmmmmmmmmm?
The retard over at Molly's fruit stand.
Naw, he don't do anything else with 'em, but he did get caught once with a Planet of the Apes doll hanging out his asshole.
Can I get some stamps off ya?  Did you fix the toilet yet?
Yeah, I remember Mr. Alacard the shop teacher use'ta call you Little Dick Wick. Hey, wasn't there a song we made up to go with that?
He should be back in a couple hours.
What happened? Oh, I'm sorry, it's none of my business.
Tickets for what?
That seems likely.
It says, "records show that Ellie Thompson was born in 1914 of normal physical stature and lived a life of normal bearings, until such time that she was placed in the care of the Willows State Mental Facility."
I don't...  ...I just thought it was weird.
Thanks for coming to get us. Little brother almost scared us to death.
I know, but we can make it out of here. We can do it.
That's not me. I didn't... I'm not doing that.
Yeah, well he's still here. I think him and Jerry are fast becoming buddies, you know Jerry... yeah, he's gotta see everything... yeah, I know... thinks there's some unsolved mystery around every corner.
Sleeping.
Christ, I hope this isn't more crappy folk art. It's so quaint... it's so primal... it's so crap.
Tell me about it.
Shhhhhh, quiet.
Can't Tiny drive us to a phone?
Just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
I don't doubt that.
Please, let us go, we won't tell anybody.
You said it, not me.
What!
Enough with the stupid voices.
Negative. Shit, we are so deep in the sticks we could walk for hours and find zero.
Doing what? Messy up your day? Well, fuck lady there are some bigger issues at hand... than your fucking have a nice fucking day bumper sticker shit!
Well, Bill... he's a good guy, he's been great help to me... a real blessing... I couldn't have asked for a better specimen. I mean you don't know what a dry spell I've had, total block...  ...total block... but Bill he's OK.
This can't be real, this can't be real, this can't be real.
My name is Lt. Wydell, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
What! God damn, how many?
I'm sure there's more than that... fucking pigs always travel in packs...  ...here, take this.
Wait, I want to say good-bye.
No they couldn't, somebody had to see something.
Right.
That's it?
How old do you think I am? I know who the fuck Spider-man is. Get to your point.
Uh...  We must never act like apes, son. For you see, The ape is our closest biological relative -- specifically the pygmy chimp.  A single chromosome separates us. But you know what truly separates us from the apes, what makes us better than apes?
And think about what you've done.
Like father, like son.
Woof.
French?
Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful.
Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident.
It's true. I wouldn't lie.
Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world.
Shit.  Hi, honey.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Hmmph. Hmmph.  Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
Unnhh.
That's Lila?
I don't know. Something's missing.
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us.
But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Three foot one.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
Shut up, you.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
Paper or cloth?
I'm not sure.
It's only that I really enjoy your company and...
I like you, too, Nathan.
A deer?
I think he's feral.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Nothing. Be right out.
Absolutely, Gabrielle.  Someone from work!  Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly.
Good. Making progress.
That's great.
I guess.
Such as what womanly things?
I had sold my fucking soul.
Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs.
I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did.
Yes.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing.
Ooka.
Bravo, Puff! Bravo!
I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world.
Even better.
Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance.
here, here.
And how do you feel about Gabrielle?
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
That's the way it's done.
Deal the cards.
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Yeah? Why?
You being cute?
Maybe he knows how to drink.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
Whaddya been so far?
Why?
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Now, when did you adopt me?
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
Miss Packard. How do you do?
How're the hands?
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
You well-heeled, partner?
Okay, I told you what I wanted about Minnesota Fats. You just go ahead and play him, friend.
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
I don't want it.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Get with what?
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
I asked around.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
How much?
Now, look, fella, I saw you playing at Ames the other night.
Ten dollars.
You're a pretty good player.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Since four.
Fine, thanks.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Come here.
Thanks.
You want to go with me?
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Yeah. For a little while.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
What's it so hot in here for?
Why did he tell you?
Is he a winner?
Yes, I'm glad.
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Come here. Come on, now.
Why should I?
I'll be up later.
Well, what's the matter?
California. Oakland.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket.  I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball...  You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Game's over, Eddie.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You lived like this once.
We move.  Place to place.
Yes.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
You are The Human.  The Hunter.  The thing that comes in the day and kills --
Yes.
I'll go.  We'll both go.  Far away.
They are... sinister.  They want to kill me.
Yeah, but when your mother came what's the first thing you showed her?
That's fine.
I'm am architect.  I'm working on a site back in --
This can be your room if you want it. What do you say?
It's that time of year again. We should get a pretty good show out here.
This should be the heaviest shower of the year.
I don't know, Dad.  But it was big.
Sure ... fine.
I'll take you to school.
That's Ed.  Ed works with the Bell Telephone switching division.
Yes -- but ...
May I ask why?
No.
Behind my house, up on the ridge.
But it's not, Jimmy.
We'll be very careful.  But we have to see.  If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?
Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
Hide the car.
No, Mom.  It wasn't a plane.
What happened to your other slipper?
The back door was open.
This afternoon.  It's wonderful up there -- you still haven't seen the best part.
I'll pack us a lunch.  Hamburgers. You always like that, don't you.
All right.  I'll be right back.
It's really nice of you to help us.
I've worked with embedded loading. They're communicating with a hidden signal. They're going to attack...
Connie, don't hang up.
Fifty six minutes, forty five seconds.
David, don't...
Punched the President? Oh my god.
I could have evacuated the cities hours ago.  You know, when I flew in the Gulf War everything is simple. We knew what we had to do. It's not simple anymore, Connie. A lot of people died today. How many didn't have to?
Think. It's like in chess. First you strategically position your pieces. Then, when the timing's right. You strike.
Can't this thing go any faster?
Dad...
Because last time I saw him I punched him in the face.
He wasn't the President then.
What'd I say?
Doesn't matter. Game's over.
She should be shortly.
Yes, Sir.
And our troops here?
That's not your call to make, Mr. Nimziki.
Sir, I strongly recommend we move you to a secured location immediately.
This is crazy. We're loosing our first strike capabilities!
Baby, you know how it is. I have to report to El Toro right away.
Naw. I'll just tell my other girlfriends they can't come over tonight.
You know how I like to make a big entrance.
He wasn't his father. I was kinda hoping he'd want the job, though.
I'm a dancer.
I thought you didn't recognize me.
Just take it, dick head.  Alicia! Make sure he takes his medicine.
I didn't take it. I thought I didn't need it anymore.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing?
You're not going anywhere. You hear me? I'm still your father.
For once in your life think about what's best for Troy. Who has to beg for money to buy him medicine when you screw up? Who?
Just fell asleep. He's gonna be just fine. Join me in a little celebration?
Deploy.
The other bombers might have more luck. We shouldn't just give up...
Die.
Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
All your life.
Yes. My treat.
Dad was onto something here!
Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
Arghhh! Oh!
No, Henry. Try not to talk.
Don't take that tone with me, my good man. Now buttle off and tell Baron Brunwald that Lord Clarence MacDonald and his lovely assistant are here to view the tapestries.
I know who you are Mr. Donovan. Your contributions to the museum over the years have been extremely generous. Some of the pieces in your collection here are very impressive.
The Holy Grail, Doctor Jones. The chalice used by Christ during the Last Supper. The cup that caught His blood at the Crucifixion and was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea.
Every man's dream.  Including your father's, I believe.
You've got the wrong Jones, Mister Donovan. Why don't you try my father?
As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
We're through!
I usually don't.
In that case, I permit you.
But I'm already sad -- by tomorrow it will have faded.
Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
So it did.
Then wait -- count to twenty.
Don't worry -- I'm fine.
Good point.
He was actually there? You saw him?
And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
Yeah?
...the solution presents itself.
What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
What final challenge?
Booby traps?
What about Marcus?
Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christ!
What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
I don't know. We'll find out.
Fly... yes. Land... no.
More or less.  Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
I know, Dad!
The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
"J".
I can get it -- I can almost reach it, Dad.
After you, Junior.
What happened to Marcus, Sallah?
Compensation for my brother-in-law's car. Indy, your father and Brody --
This is a different situation, Dr. Jones. These people are like children. We have to lead them slowly into the twentieth century.
Something magical. A sacred rock.
Even if they were trying to scare us away, a devout Hindu would never touch meat.  Makes you wonder what these people are...
Miss Scott panicked?
Did you discover anything in that tunnel, Dr. Jones?
Finally!
No -- you can't go! Something awful's happened. They've got Short Round and I think Indy's been --
We found a tunnel that leads to a temple below the palace! Please, come with me, I'll show you!
It's some kind of cult! And they've got the sacred stones that Indy was searching for.
His Highness has not yet taken a wife.
Dr. Jones, we are all vulnerable to vicious rumors. I seem to remember that in Honduras you were accused of being a grave robber rather than a scientist.
Kali Ma protects us now and for ever, and we must pledge our devotion by worshipping her with an offering of flesh and blood!
Sure, I found him. Then last night I had a little trouble. Somebody tried to slit my throat.
A bonus, Dr. Jones. That is poison. You just drank the rest of it.
That's it. Pankot Palace.
Why?
Behind you!
You're betrayed Shiva. 
Pankot isn't on the way to Delhi.
Nobody brought us here. Our plane crashed. We were shot down by --
Siam.
Since I was nice enough to let you tag along, why don't you give your mouth a rest? Okay, doll?
What?!
THE WHAT?!
Well, when my nightclub career was run over by the Depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the Orient..." So, look where I got.
I'd be safer sleeping with that snake.
I'm a scientist. I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" --
Don't catch cold.
That's it -- the release lever -- look inside!
Quiet!
Yes, they believe you.
Not quite.
What for?
Willie, come on!
Al ???!!!
Al.
Yes?
Yes.
Yes.
What is your name?
I just got here.
Where are we?
Well...If you're in my head... to you, I'm...GOD!
I just went there for a job.
Yes...Yes...I'll explain it all. Just put the gun down.
With a man in my head...
No one. Maybe I dreamed it all up.
Still clear. Just a motorcycle.
Is it familiar? Have you been here before.
Who did?
I can't remember..
You do. To get out of here. You're gonna be me.
Just scratched my arm, why?
I'm at the airport.
Composition of the sand, ...trace elements..unique...
Send a man there. A secret agent.
Use my credit cards.
Who cares?
Nothing, but it's yours. Change it. Change your whole persona.
How else do you get seaweed under your nails?
For chrissakes, it's only sand. You should see some of the stuff that's floating around in here. That sand's the cleanest thing in you, including me. Now EAT it!
What was?
Try another language.
What can I do? You're on your own.
Don't just stand there, say something.
Anything. Aw hell...Just tell her the truth.
.
Maybe they won't stand on ceremony.
Rene...
That place. By the window.
Are you serious?
I don't know what's going on.
Your data must be bad. Everyone can't be lying all the time.
She's the toughest to read.
This just won't work.
I don't know!
Is that all?
Why don't you get out of my face.
We are trying to stand out. Right near his address. Easier to get them to come to us, than to try and find them. ..now keep your eyes open, something might present itself.
Follow her.
That's not funny.
You think. That's what you're good at.
Never mind, just say it.
Probably.
And Dieter?
Losing power. The laser drained it.
Where've you been?
Rene?
Face it, we're the men for the job. Besides, if someone is really chasing you, the best way to avoid them is to keep moving ...and FIND THE GODDAMN PEM.
Oh, I can't.
I know we fight, but I don't mean it. You're quite a guy. No one else could have dealt with this.
Trouble...is, if we both get stuck here.
We'll let you go. You leave the pods and the PEM.
It's the least we can do. After all, it's our responsibility.
I have a new client.
It's just money.
And how do you service foreigners.
Oh.
Remember what?
Oh....Sure.
The little man in my...  ...head...
Been complaning of hallucinations.
Much better now, thank you. Just sit here quietly...see there's nothing to worry about...just be my old self again....soon...
Just give me the keys.
What's what?
I didn't say anything.
Yes?
Nothing...Al. Why do you talk   that way?
Like there's someone else here.
...Rene.
It's not apparent.
You are.
You talk to yourself.
Why do you do it?
You seemed interesting.
They kidded me a little.
No.
You did.
This is a tough place to keep Kosher.
I'm sorry. What will you do?
What's he done?
He must be a good friend.
How do you know you can trust me?
Beats me.
Must be a pick-up, a rendezvous.
He plays it all the time.
Get us one.
You've  been there?
You coming along?
Can you?
I can't fly it.
Yes. No. I'm...okay. They can't do this. They can't hold us here.
What?
You're gonna laugh.
It was you.
I'm sorry. We're running behind. So many applicants...so few jobs... If you'll just have a seat.
A drink...
Why not?
Just one. The back up.
Thank you.
Perfectly.
Instant rice...?
That remote control thing?
You got a deal. 
You bet we are. And I can't talk to you now.
Oh, no, of course they're not influenced by money. They work for free. And you are a Volunteer Executive Producer.
Well, what do you think I'm going to do? Quit in protest? I'm not going to do that.
End up in a high-profile lawsuit with Lowell, the First Amendment martyr? I don't think so.  Take a look at this... This is a summary of a dossier that's being prepared.
No. I should have. I told them I disagreed with you, Mike and Kluster that this segment is as good as the original. I'm not lying for you. I'm not gonna shut up for you. Not on any of it.
I'm not touching my film...
Before you go...
Yes. Yes, I do.  Yes, I get extremely emotional when assholes put bullets in my mailbox...!
Okay. 
"Mike?"
You're getting ahead of yourself. We're all in this together. We're all CBS. We'll find out soon. Thank you, gentlemen.
Okay.  Lowell?
Hey, it doesn't work? You've burned your bridges, man.
Okay... About this whistle-blower... Did Mike and Don go along with the corporate decision?
Don't you have to be at the office?
Yes, it's on the stove...
Soy sauce...
No, thank you.
What's the difference...
Can we talk about this when I get back?
Hello? Yeah...
...it's anonymous. References to "P.M."  It's got to be Philip Morris, huh?
I'm alone on this...
Alright.
I'll call you then.
Yeah.
What chance is there of getting Jeff's interview on the air...?
You eating with us?
Hardly new news.
How are the rooms? Comfortable?
Good.
"Put the corporation at risk"...? Give me a fucking break!
I took off on Tisch. I took off on corporate. They'll know they're not going to see everything on Sunday night...
You disappeared on me. How long you staying?
Alright. What did you think?
Oh, lots.
Everything interests me.
That's good. That works.  Uh, you know, I want to ask you something... I know it sounds odd... but...
What are you talking about? Where are you?
Good. I want to talk to you.
Then... you're in a state of conflict, Jeff.
Oh, yes, yes, yes, I did... I wanted to talk to you. I wanted to hook up and talk to you. About what we were talking about in your car.
My father? What the hell's that got to do with my father?
They're gonna dig up stuff from your past, they're gonna throw it at you. I got to know what they're gonna throw. You understand?
...to a network, probably, we're all commodities.  To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important.
They're terrorizing us. Death threats?! To my family? My kids?!
Yeah, great.
No.
I do not think that you "know" for me... what it is to walk in my shoes...  ...for my kids to have seen it... for them to know why I've put them through what I did... the public airing of that... the testament to why I did what I did... you're telling me is not going to see the light of day.
And I've got to refute every fucking accusation made in this report before The Wall Street Journal runs.  I am trying to protect you, man!
That's bullshit, Jeff!
You're breaking up. I can't hear you.
There is -- there is no family.
Liane has filed for divorce...
Right.
A delivery device for nicotine.
And you sent the document forward to Sandefur?
And, do you wish you hadn't come forward? You wish you hadn't blown the whistle?
Oh, you got rights and lefts! Ups and downs and middles! So what?! You don't get to instruct anything around here! This is not North Carolina, not South Carolina nor Kentucky. This is the sovereign State of Mississippi's proceeding. Wipe that smirk off your face! Dr. Wigand's deposition will be part of this record. And I'm going to take my witness' testimony! Whether the hell you like it or not!  Answer the question, Dr...
Howard!
You did good, Massey!
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Is that... one person?
Mr. Dumbarton.
Shut up. I was a lawyer. Just like you. And my clients? Whores just like you.
You want Botox?
We did not.
I should be in therapy.
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Asian? No.
You have the pre-nup?
Yes?
So, that's good, right?
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Isn't everything?
Have you ever been married, Miles?
You just haven't met the right person.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
Absolutely.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
Thank you.
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
Me. Yes.
She held that against you?
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
Your mother was.
No.
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
What is it Miles?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Do you want to sleep on it?
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
I bet.
May I come in?
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
What kind of "stuff?"
That's blackmail.
Please! Leave the house.
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
Thank you, Mrs. Rexroth.
Of Massey Myerson?
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Oh, God!
Shit.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
I want to be exposed.
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
He would invite these girls home from the staple factory to our condominium in Palm Springs. He had a device he called the Intruder.
Yes. Maybe you're right, Miles. Maybe we're being too conservative. Seventy five percent.
Kirshner does not apply. Kirshner was in Kentucky.
Rex, please.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
I'm not sure.
Video.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
Video.
Sorry.
What are they?
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
-- the coin?
We don't have much of a relationship anymore. I haven't seen her since before she married Rex. We had some very nice times prior to that. We were quite close.
Who's Rex's guy?
Why—uh—she's all right, sir.
"I found a million dollar baby—"
If I didn't I wouldn't be here!  I've got it all itemized. 
Yes, I know—but—
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
I'll get it annulled.
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Oh, yes. I heard.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
Lower the boats!
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
Sock her!
Yes, sir.
Yes, of course.
Any others?
There's another wire from Peter, sir. They're in Glen Falls, Michigan.
"Young people in love Are very seldom hungry. People in love Are very seldom hungry . . ."
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
Fresh guy, huh! What you need is a good sock on the nose.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you—  scram.
Are you talking to me?
Well—of all the—well—  Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Yes.
I hated to wake you up.  How about some breakfast?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
You must have me confused with—
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
Beat it! 
Are you talking to me!
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind. 
Smart aleck!
The pleasure is all mine.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed? 
I can't go out like this.
Like this. I have no robe.
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime.  Come on, sit down.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
No. No. It's too good a story.
Um. You're doing all right.
You don't have to lose your temper!  That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you—
Well, you were!
You weren't so bad yourself.
Next week "East Lynne."
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
Why, haven't you—?
You didn't give that boy all your money?
No.
That's silly.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
You're prejudiced.
What?
Well, take them off.
What?
Doesn't sound very exciting.
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Raw?
There's no end to your accomplishments.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
Why not? I'm hungry.
Come on—get in.
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
You bet I did.
Hey, wait a minute!  Let's get something straightened out right now. If you've any peculiar ideas that I'm interested in you, forget it. You're just a headline to me.
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
Who—me?  Want to see me?
Not interested. 
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Sorry, Miss. It's gone.  Ellie's face clouds. The crowds surge about her. She looks around thoughtfully. Suddenly her eyes open in surprise at something she sees, and the VIEW then moves over to Peter, who sits on his suitcase, looking toward Ellie.
You ain't gonna stick me for no phone calls. You can go down to the Sheriff's office.
Get out!
Yeah.
What!  Say, listen you!  When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office—unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours. 
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
Well, I got it, Joe.
I am, Joe.
Well, I'll be—
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
I ain't got a hat.
Yeah.
Yeah. You know, one of those toy things. They sent me to the store to get it.
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60.
He looked like an upright young feller to me, Ma.
That's right.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see—and—
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
My instinct is that Ferrie is going to keep on deteriorating, and we'll end up getting more out of him when he finally cracks.  If we call him now, he might freeze up and we could lose the best shot we've ever had.
I've seen him copying files, leaving here late at night.
Because you keep conning me, Dean. I read your testimony to the Warren Commission and...
You tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "Clay Bertrand" and asked to fly to Dallas and be Lee Oswald's layer.
You can't ever say crime don't pay in Louisiana, Jim - only not as good as it used to.  Good chowder, ain't it?
Like I told to the Washington boys, Bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his Marine discharge...
I don't know how they got to me. Maybe cause I repped him here.  The Feebees run background checks.  On my mama's breasts, man, that's all I got.  There wasn't no conspiracy, Jim.  If there were, why the hell didn't Bobby Kennedy prosecute it as Attorney General, he was his brother for Chrissake.  How the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, I don't know.  It was Oswald.  He was a nut job.  Faggot, y'know, hated this country.
God's sake, chief.  The President was shot.
Susie, you're an assistant D.A., remember.  Stick to what you can prove in court.
Hey, where y'at, Frank?  You're wasting your time here.  Big Jim gave strict orders.  No FBI allowed.
Boss would fry me in hog fat if he knew... 
No, I'm not...
Pretty flowery for Dave Ferrie.
Who is he, Joe?  I've been to every bar, no one wants to talk.
Clay Bertrand is Clay Shaw?  The guy who used to run the International Trade Mart?
Yeah.  Clay.  I met him sometime in June of '62 at the Masquerade Bar. Dave Ferrie took me there, for the express reason to meet him.
To frame him, obviously.  You got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, Bill!  They're not ordinary crooks.
Let's start making some assumptions about the man.  Why would he leave a path as big as Lee Harvey Oswald's? This is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one.  Who found the evidence?  Who set him up?  Lou, Bill, Susie, I want you to go back and check all the sightings of Oswald in Dallas, New Orleans and Mexico in the summer and fall of '63 - see if it's the same guy.
He'd die pretty quick, either a heart storm or a ruptured blood vessel in the brain.
No, I did not.
Dave, you know that's where this road leads.
Yeah!  He'd kill for you Dave.  He likes you.  Your mind.
Do you remember me, Mr. Garrison?  I met you on Carondolet Street right after your election.  I congratulated you, remember?
I see.  And where did you drive?
I see.  Dave thank you for your time.  I'm sorry it has to end inconveniently for you, but I'm going to have you detained for further questioning by the FBI.
Dave, I find your story simply not believable.
Oh, you got that?  Banister's pet project.  Getting paid by the government to work against the government.  Beautiful.  What a mind he had, what a guy, Guy.  He had all those files.
Fuckin' A.  How do you think the Agency gets people to do their bullshit?  Fuck knows what they got on Oswald!
Shaw's an "untouchable", man - highest clearance.  Shaw, Oswald, the Cubans - all Agency.
Jack?  Jack was a pimp.  A bagman in Dallas for the Mob.  He used to run guns to Castro when he was still on our side.  Check out Jack Youngblood. Shit - we almost had Castro.  Then we tried to whack him.  Everybody's flipping sides all the time.  It's fun 'n' games, man fun 'n' games.
But you took his orders.  He was directing the autopsy.
Well, I am saying it.  Bring in the jury.
That's something, Jasper.  What is it?
I knew something was crooked as a dog's hind leg, 'cause no one who is just taking a deposition gets that involved and angry... sure enough, when I finally read my testimony as published by the Warren Commission, it was a fabrication from start to finish.
Negative on his tax records. Classified.  First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record.  I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them.  There are about 1200 documents...  Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them.  All classified as secret on the grounds of national security.  It's real strange.
Makes sense - he's a spokesman.
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
And Marina?  Does she have a problem getting out?
Sort of like Benedict Arnold coming back to George Washington's cabinet.
I wonder about the Williams'.  Just where did the first description of Oswald come from at 12:44?  No one knows.  They claimed it was Brennan's, but his description came after 1 P.M.  Who called?  Somehow the FBI's been tapping the Williams' and picks up a call between Bell Helicopter and Janet's phone, an unidentified voice saying "We both know who's responsible."  Who called?  Why's the Bureau been tapping them?
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans!  It's outrageous!
This is interesting - are you ready for this?  Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination.  It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Well... in an investigation we're conducting your name has come up a number of times.
Not at all.  But on the other hand, I do have a lovely Chippendale dining table and I often have a friend over sitting at one end while I sit at the other.  That is precisely the point of a long dining table.  The splendor of the meal adds to the enjoyment of it.
It adds a taste of elegance for which I must confess a weakness for now and then.  I call him Smedley.  His real name is Frankie Jenkins - but I could hardly imagine anything more uncouth during dinner than my turning toward the kitchen and hollering "Frankie!" .. Where is this leading to, Mr. Garrison?
Pffft!  Absolute nonsense.  The Quarter is filled with vivid imaginations, my dear Mr. Garrison - grimy young hoodlums who'll say and do anything.  As you well know.
One meets so many attorneys in my business.  No, I don't believe I know Dean Andrews.
Naturally.  Are you claiming, Mr. Garrison, that Mr. Oswald also had dinner with me?
Mmmmm... sure smells good... but Egghead, do you realize Oswald was interrogated for twelve hours after the assassination, with no lawyer present, and nobody recorded a word of it?  I can't believe it.  A police captain with 30 years experience and a crowd of Federal agents just had to know that with no record anything that Oswald said would be inadmissible in court.
It's incredible, honey - the whole thing.  A Lieutenant Colonel testifies that Lee Oswald was given a Russian language exam as part of his Marine training only a few months before he defects to the Soviet Union.  A Russian exam!
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
Liz, I'm really sorry.  The meeting went much longer than expected.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake!  ...Oh, it's Lou.
Our home, Jim!  A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
How do you know?  How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore!  You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
I'm leaving.  I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving!  I won't stand it anymore.
You and your government!  What's the matter with you?  Don't you have any feelings?  Your daughter!  What kind of man are you?
I never doubted for a second that I was.  Will you come to the trial, Elizabeth?
Oh no!  No!  I can't believe it.  I can't believe it.  Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
Bring on all the motherfuckers! Bring their college degrees in here! I got nuthin' to hide.  They can't buy me.  You can't buy me.  I don't even need the parole.  This is about the truth coming out.  You're a goddamn liberal, Mr. Garrison, you don't know shit, cause you never been fucked in the ass.  Fascism is here now, Facism is...
You wanna know why?  'Cause that mother fucker Kennedy stole that fuckin' election, that's why!  Nixon was gonna be one of the great Presidents 'til Kennedy wrecked this fuckin' country.  Got niggers all over the fuckin' place asking for their rights, where do you think we got all this fuckin' crime now, 'cause Kennedy promised 'em too damned much. Revolution comin'.  Fascism's coming back.  I tell ya this - the day that Communist sumbitch died was a great day for this country.  I jes' hate to think they're blaming it on some silly fuckin' Oswald who didn't know shit anyway.  People should know why that sumbitch was killed.  'Cause he was a Communist.  Put me on the stand, go ahead, I'll tell the same goddamn story, I'm proud of it, don't matter fuck all to me, things don't change.
Yeah, Guy Banister.  Ex-FBI man.  He died couple years ago.
What are you driving at, boss?
I have a plane to catch... going to Washington.  An interesting lead, says he's closely connected to these events, but he won't come down here... I know what you're going through with Ferrie, Lou.  We'll talk tomorrow.
I'd say the opposite - hypertension.
Who?
Allen Dulles?
Russell, honestly you sound like one of those kooky critics spreading paranoia like prairie fire.  I just can't believe the Chief Justice of the United States would put his name on something that wasn't true.
I've been called everything under the sun, Jerry.  Call me whatever you like.
Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry.  It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over.  But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence!  They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
Sure they do.  The camera can pick this up.
Yes.
Well, I just hope it was worth my while, Mr...
I've already been warned by the Agency, Mr. Whoever.  If this is another type of threat, I don't...
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse.  You, too.  I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging.  Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy.  That's important - it's historic.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town.  You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks.  Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack.  Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
His name?
Never touched me.
I don't know if I should talk about this.
Was he there often?
There was one guy, I don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair - I saw him come into the office once. He looked out of place, y'know - like a society guy.  Can't remember his name.  Oswald was with him.
It's a contradiction, Numa, get used to them.  The only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets.  Or fake secrets.
He'll never make it.  If he wins, they'll kill him.  He wants to avenge his brother.  He'll stop that war. No, they'll kill him before they let him become President.
Yes, thank you, Mr. Garrison.  Your coffee's almost Turkish down here but I could get used to it.
I imagine because this is the Criminal District Court Building  This is an enlargement of a potential shooter standing behind the picket fence.  We...
If you must know, virtually nothing.
The job manages to keep me pretty busy.
How long do you think it would take me to be appointed?
Yes.
Who was there for your ass?
Look, I hate to be the kinda nigga, does a nigga a favor -- then BAM -- hits a nigga up for a favor in return. But I'm afraid I gotta be that kinda nigga.
Course you didn't.
Can she afford a good one is the question. Otherwise she'll be in Sybill Brand three weeks easy before the Public Defender gets around to her.
Hey, Jackie.
She wants to go back to work.
What time do you have to be there?
Sure, ever been to the Riverbottom?
It's okay. It's a cop hangout.
You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
It was the other guy who busted me.
Give 'em what you got. Offer to help. Show a willingness to be helpful. You want to stay out of jail, don't you?
You went out this morning and bought a gun?
You went out this morning and bought a gun.
Sure.
What I meant was have a lawyer do the negotiating for you.
No thanks. There's gotta be other ways to get it out.
Surprise.
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
How was it?
They seem to like the idea.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
Okay, sure. I might be tempted. Especially now, since I'm getting out of the bail bonds business.
Shoot him with the stun gun. While he's incapacitated, cuff him, take 'em to County.
He never came home. But I'm sitting on the couch, in the dark, holding my stun gun and the whole house smells of mildew -- So after a couple hours I think, "What am I doing here? Nineteen years of this shit? So I made up my mind, that's it.
All Winston had to do was ask around. Ordell's living in Long Beach with a woman junkie.
People talk to Winston. He's street, same as them, they trust him. They get busted, they know somebody who can bond them out. I thought I might drop in on him. He'll no doubt be surprised to see me.
I'm sure.
You'll get over that.
I'm just tired in general.
And cooperate? You might get probation.
Do you live together?
Not every day?
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
You two meet?
Ever meet her, or they talk about her?
Who's the other one?
She told you that?
Was she there?
But she mentioned Beaumont by name?
Oh, that's taken care of. I called the State Attorney's Office. You were no-filed this morning in Circuit Court.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
I thought you were watching him.
Gimme one anyway.
I told them.
I suppose you see a piece of this for yourself?
I can do that.
What the hell you talkin' bout?
Well, you weren't supposed to be there.
She won't have no problems 'cause she don't know nothin'.
She don't know shit about the money.
We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
Uh-huh.
We had done time together already.
I don't like dancing.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that.
Does that bother you?
Uh-huh?
And your point is?
Uh-huh?
All right already.
Just stay right fuckin' here, all right?
What's your cost?
C'mon in.
Over half-million dollars worth of merchandise.
What does that mean?
Hang it up, she's on her way. You gotta listen to this. This involves you.
Did you get it?
When I see you. Pick me up at Sam's. You count the money?
That's what I gotta tell you. She bugged me the whole time. Got pissy with me 'cause I wouldn't let her carry the bag. Started running her fuckin' mouth... I couldn't remember right away when we came out where the car was parked, so she got on me about that. "Is it this aisle Lou- is, is it that one?" She was totally fuckin' with my nerves.
Twice. In the parking lot.
In the chest and stomach.
We went to the parking lot.
Maybe the Feds got it.
Tell me.
Sure thing. I don't have to know what I'm doing, long as you know.
He's a big one. You two tight?
It was our idea to take the picture, wasn't it?
Fella named Beaumont. They have him up at county. It started out drunk driving, but they wrote it up "possession of a concealed weapon." Dumb monkey-ass had a pistol on him.
You think you could do that?
The door was opened, so I just came right in.
She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty- five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all.
Did the police contact you?
What does she do for you?
Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand.
She got off, huh?
Git your ass in here.
'Ola!
I was gonna tell you...
Just to see you. That's all.
No, don't. But thanks.
Stop!!!!
I don't know if I can. It's just that war is war. Things happen.
There's nothing to expose.
Maybe it's not the army, Jake.
Don't bother to call again, okay?
This isn't injustice, Mr. Geary. The army did something to us and we've got to find out what.
Exactly. And we need someone to cut through it. We hear you're the man.
Ah! Well then, they're going to have to pay for that, aren't they?
You need ... a doctor.
Something's going on here. You're not telling me something. What the hell's gotten into you?
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
War games? Thailand? That's not true! How can you believe that? Can't you see what they're doing? It's all a lie. We were in Da Nang, for God's sake. You've got to believe me.
Why do you say that?
He told me he was going to Hell.
How long had that been going on?
I think something's fucking connect- ed. I mean, a car tried to run me over the other day. Doug too, right? We've got six guys here going fucking crazy.
How do you know?
I was absent the day they taught that in school. What did she say?
I'm with another woman now. We're both with the post office, Midtown, 34th Street branch.
I doubt it's my mind that interests her. I tell you Prof, she's a fiery lady.
I see them, Prof. Everywhere. They're invading my life.
Hell, you think I am?
It's freezing.
If I knew I wouldn't have to ask. What did you do? I was happy the way it was.
Thanks.
Don't ask.
I don't know.
Your kid dropped it off.
Why you left.
Gabe.
I wanna leave. Get me out of here.
Where are we?
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
It's gone to the top.
Get your clothes off.
Lie down!
You are the most unbelievable woman I have ever met. One second you're a screaming banshee and the next you're Florence Nightingale. Who are you? That's what I want to know. Will the real Jezzie Pipkin please stand up.
Why didn't you call me?
I don't believe this.
Stay away from me, Jez.
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what?  Vietnam? ... What experiments?
I'm gonna make love to you. That's what I'm gonna do.
Yep. Finally. I love you, Jez.
Don't play games with me. There's nothing more to say.
Sometimes. When it's convenient.
I don't know.
No. I couldn't.
I don't know what to say.
Tan? What tan? It faded on the airplane. I'd try to get my money back, but who do you ask?  Two hundred dollars a night, for what?
What?!
Help me!
Louis Schwartz. Nostrand Avenue.
I'm awake?
Where's Sarah? Where did she go?  She was here ...
She said I haven't been the same since then. Since that night. There's still this big hole in my brain. It's so dark in there, Jake. And these creatures. It's like they're crawling out of my brain. What happened that night? Why won't they tell us?
Are you kidding? We've put up more of her cousins. You wouldn't believe how they breed down there.
Jesus, Jesus! ... When?
He doesn't like it.
Speaking of which, duck!
Yes it does.
Yeah yeah I better call the labs, see what the hell is going on.
He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here.
What do you mean, not enough time?
We're not leaving Crutch!
Why wouldn't we be. I mean, look around. So far so good.
Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage.
The hull's imploding!
Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there.
Thorgan, suit up.
Then stop talking and work faster!
Suit up.
Not a chance.
At least try to get him alive...will ya Brodski?
No, you're dead! You're all dead!
Look! Just get everyone together, get off the ship... and then blow it to kingdom fucking come! That's the only way you're going to live.
I hope so.
400 years in the future and these pea-shooters are the best you can do?!
What if we don't?
It's better this way. If we were rescued Jason would just get off the ship. You want him on your precious Earth II?
I think so, why?
What about the others? Shouldn't we wait?
Oh I like her a lot.
She's obviously dealt with this guy before.
I'm on my way.
Well, do something!
Keep your shirt on! I'm working on it. You won't believe what we found.  Adrienne! Stoney!
Try to calm down. Just think, you're going to be famous!
Are you crazy?! Pull the lever!
Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
Sergeant, we could use a big bomb.
Come here, might as well fix that arm.
Don't worry about me. I live for this shit.
I am now. I missed you, Thorgan.
Then open the doors!
We just left old Earth. You'll never believe what we found.
If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here?
Nanotechnology.
We've had Nano-Tech for the last 30 years.
Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
Why don't you get it? He's going to kill us all!
You wanna die?
Exactly.
It's okay.
Here --  Take him home.
Two cases. And dinner when you land.
We got a barrel on him. We can't lose him. We stay out here until we find him.
Dead astern! Zig-zag!
Full throttle! To port!
'cause when we bought the house it was Autumn. This is summer. Feed the dogs.
No. Home here.
You going to be all right?
All I'm saying is that Amity is a summer town -- we need summer dollars, and if they can't swim here, they'll use the beaches at Cape Cod, or Long Island.
That's good. That's real good. Ben Meadows getting pictures for the paper.
Be reasonable, boys -- this isn't the time or the place to do some kind of half-assed autopsy on a fish. Ben...  do you have all the pictures you need?
Why?
Maybe we can save August...
You're tellin' me. I swear, this town has gone crazy.
Who are you?
Swell.
Just as I thought. He drifted up here with the Gulf Stream, from southern waters.
I Bought it.  Both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so I don't have to touch my principal.
It is a job. I'm not fooling around like some amateur. It's my life!
I want to check something. Hold my feet.
You're situation here suggests that a Great White has staked out a claim in the waters around Amity Island, and that he will continue to feed here as long as there is food in the water.
I wish it would rain...
This is quite a place.
Just keep kicking.
Somebody could've -- I was sort of passed out.
We never had any. What's the problem?
I wouldn't put it that way. But I love sharks.
Like those Cousteau specials on television? I think it's for the kids, but I love them.
Just fine, Missus. We'll be back soon. Everything's fine. We haven't seen anything yet. Orca out.
Let me see your hands...
I'll see ya. Tell Dorothy hello.
Just a little appetizer. I want our porker to know we're serving. I want to put some iron into that big yap...
And I'll drink to yours.
I think I can top that, Mister...
He's under!
Let's just cut him open and see what's inside...
So that's cool with you, then?
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Oh, hey Vijay.
Yup.
What are you talking about?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
Fine. Call me when you learn how to love just one person and not cheat at your brother's college just because you had four Smirnoff Ices and a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
What? No! Do we come off like paranoid yuppies or something?
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
Commercials.
Have you seen those ads for Titanium Power men's deodorant?
I wrote that.
Hey, I like this.
Well, sort of. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.
You're something else.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Come on, I have something for you.
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
No thanks. I'm off pills.
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Nothing.
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
Congrats.
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
You're pregnant?
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
You mean like couples?
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
I am a suicide risk.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
She's hormonal. Right, June? It's just part of the whole process.
I don't know. There's just things I still want to do.
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
...Yeah.
He whips you?
You can?
Took 'em all.
...That's not true.
Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now.
Well Adele... it was for...  ...saving your fucking life back there!
Early! Stop!!
Not so good. You sure you have to?
Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite.
Henry Lee Lucas. Well he was only convicted of killing eleven but he claimed to have killed over three hundred.
They picked up hitchhikers... young men... and brought them back here.
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
...I do.
...I think it's the best stuff I've done.
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
I don't want to talk about it.
A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything.
Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too.
Why, what did he do?
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em...  Like fer shurr!
...Brian hurt his foot.
No, never. Excuse me.
Wasn't my fault...
What is it?
Who are you?
Well now I'd say that's the least of Mr. Diebold's problems.
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
You fucked it?
Who am I? Who am I? The mothafuckin' virgin surgeon.
Oh my god, so good. That girl can fuck.
Hell yeah. That bitch was bleeding. When I first put it in she screamed real loud. I saw her bite down on the pillow.
Did what take?
How did she smell? Did her puss stink?
Hell's yeah. She was so clean.
Yeah.
What do you want?
What for? That guys a dick.
Den less go Joe.
Three pennies and a ball of lint.
Right.
Man I haven't seen her in forever. What the fuck's she up to?
He looks like my uncle.
Darcy?
Yeah.
Bet.
I guess so. I gotta stop off home too.
So.
Why not? You stink.
Maybe Nasa. I don't know.
Probably. Fuck that, I'll sneak in. I need some female vagina tonight.
Na.
I don't know. But all I know is that I kicked him so many times my fuckin' toe feels broken.
Yeah. Do it again.
Naw. I'm not seeing anybody. What about you?
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
Yes.
Nothing?
I don't want you to hurt me.
Do you care about me?
Bang up stuff.
No, Fidget, I...
No...
You want to fuck me. But you can't fuck me.
But, I don't know. I'm just scared that things would change. Between us.
Do you care about me?
No.
What?
You're OK?
A bad day! You wanna hear a bad day? Yesterday my son was smashed over by a car and when my wife found out she collapsed on the floor. She had a minor heart attack. Partial paralysis. But I don't let myself get sad. No way. Not me. It's not good for the soul.
No.
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Yeah. I was gonna write a book but I can't spell.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
I know.
Foreplay. Foreplay.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing.  That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Good luck.
I only did it once and...
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
No. I just gotta go find him.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
Yeah I get bored.
Did they ask you a lot of questions?
It's not his fault. He had a hard life.
You've heard the stories right?
Oh god. That's horrible.
Four-thirty in the morning?
If I had it, maybe. But right now I don't have a penny to my name.
It's me. Telly.
Paul it's Telly. Open up.
Nothing. We just wanted to come by and see what you were up to.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
It's grandmother style.
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
To come?
Yes.
What kind of problem?
You are!  I don't like you.
It means, if I were a killer and I thought the police were closing in on me I might invent someone to try and put them off the scent.
What?
Let's see how much he wants to play.
You think you're going to catch him on a trace?  Everything he does is planned out well in advance.  The only way we're going to get him is to rattle him -- make him slip up.
You don't have an investigation without me.  You got that?
No, I need the original note.
I was at the beach.
I'm positive.
Run it down.
I'm sorry, this is just too convenient.
Could someone this disturbed give the appearance of being normal?
I've got a feeling we're going to go the distance with him.  Let him sweat for a little while.
I don't know.  Maybe there's two of them.  Maybe he hired some Wino to make the calls.
Who is this?
I haven't got time for this.
We all have paths to follow.  You hope yours will lead you to me.
Do you know what I'm doing right now, Peter?  I'm looking at the name of the girl I'm going to kill tonight.
I know what I said!  She looks just like...
Please, I don't want to get into the psychological aspects of my actions. It would detract from the game.
If it's so important, why don't you just tell me?
Very good.
You're groping.  I have been fair. It's my move now.
Don't beg, Peter.  She has to die.  I can't win unless she dies.
No!  Wait!!
Can we correlate data?  Look for specific things, like player's ages... stuff like that?
Have computer search for anyone that's used that opening against me.  There can't be more than a handful.
New York.  1986.  Viktor Yurilivich.
You could have been honest with me for starters.  We work together.  I have to be able to trust you.
Fuck off!
How come the police never had a record of Sanderson before.  This doesn't come out of nowhere, there has to be a history.
You're losing me.
Uh huh.
Of course.
For what?
Six, eight hours tops.
Not that I can see.  We'll know more once I get the lab reports back from Seattle.
Not much.  I don't think she was raped. There's no bruising, or any signs of trauma to the pelvic region -- and no trace of sperm which makes sense because she took a bath.
No prints.
No Frank.  No prints.
Yeah.
About a quarter to one.
We're going to work on the message.
Here.  I played Gregory Lutz.
To my room and then I went for a walk.
That's alright.  We'll take it from here.
How can he be playing Chess with you? You're not making any moves against him.
Wait a minute.  There's an apartment in that area called the Castle Arms.
Are we going to go through this again?
On a variation, yes -- but it must be a variation that is unique.
Our computer went on the fritz again. David came up to fix it.
Hi, Sara.  This is Doctor Sheppard.  I was wondering if you could tell me if you have a book on chess called "Principals and Tactics" by Anton Berger.
What are they, please?
Yes.
How come you don't stay with them?
Not really.  You see your goal and you go after it.  Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
Chess is a reflection of life.  Life is violent.  The strong win.  The weak perish.
If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
I see.  This is going to be a very polite conversation.  What shall we discuss?  The weather?  Movies?
Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
Getting too hot in here for you?
Did you think it was going to be easy? You think he was going to lay it out at your feet?
I don't think I could.
Another kind of game?
I think it's best if we don't ask too many personal questions -- I want to keep things on a professional level.
Why?
I dunno.  Where's Erica mother?
And you?
I'm just trying to get to know you, Peter.
What are you talking about?  You don't even know me.
Then show me who you are.
I can't think any more, unless it's about you.  I'll be in the middle of a match and instead of thinking about my next move, I think about how you look when you smile.  Remember how you said that I hide behind my chessboard?  Ever since my wife died I've been...  I've been afraid of getting too close to someone again -- afraid of losing them.
You don't understand.
Why not?
Well, you should be, because this time I'm going to win.
Maybe you'd better look around for another candidate. I don't think my skin is tough enough to survive a lifetime of you and your brush.
In a great fortress in the mountains. Wait. Something's happening.
You must move away from the Center.
It was a platonic kiss, Father.
You can't reach her!  Through the door.  Quickly!
Does the Queen live?
Turold's son was to marry her.
I have no extraordinary powers.
Two or three days! While Lyssa is in their hands?
But there is another entrance to this place.
Then even if Lyssa tells us where she is, we'll never be able to reach her, for they will never allow the Fortress to rise near us.
Yes. They will be more help than high-born barons.
Yes, they knew of your first contact, so they drove her below.
The deeper she goes, the harder it is to contact her. Once she is below the second level, you will not be able to reach her at all.
He sees betrayal everywhere. He will attack us so long as he is conscious.
I chose the wrong passage.
Use your sword.
Cut. <u>Cut</u>!
I forbid you!
I found the body of the Seer in the stream.
Yes. It is today.
Each to his fate.
Perhaps you think no man would return to me.
Yes.
You will not, then?
I doubt it. The water is only an inch deep.
A forest near the Valley of Needles.
What business?
Hah! You don't know me, boy.
Why do they burn the villages? There's nothing to gain.
These we'll pay for.
Those beasts cannot be saddled by mortal men.
The Swamp of Betrayal. Be glad we don't have to cross it.
First, you desert me, and now you mock me. Go back to your one-eyed friend.
Would you desert your friends?
You had better manners as a pig.
The greatest boon of your otherwise worthless life, blockhead, is the privilege of dining on boar roasted by the hand of Ergo the Magnificent.
You know nothing of power, you foolish girl. You think power is a mighty sword, or a strong castle, or the paltry magic of an Emerald Seer. Power is none of these.
It has been taken, Freylag and all his people slaughtered.
Modred has treated with the Dark Ones.
It is important to assure the succession.
They will have the life that you and I might have had.
How many did you lose?
She has the power to kill.
It's a hundred leagues from here.
That is true.
No, she was not as beautiful.
We had no children.
Yes.
Power you have given me. What can my power give you?
Of what?
Why must you know?
Tomorrow, the Fortress of Krull will rise with the sun in the Valley of Reeds. But the knowledge is of no use to you. No man has ever escaped the Web. And soon the creature will come for you, even here.
You cannot stop time. Go now, before it runs out.
Why do you want to know?
OK. Mister Stansfield, Norman STANSFIELD.
Yeah... How do you know it?
No?
No... Not yet.  He's very shy... and very sensitive.
...Not at all.
Good.
Yeah...  Come on, have a little training.
OK.
Yes.
Quick doesn't mean "ready". And you can't discuss, we said. Right?
No.
No, you can't go out.
OK... And if it's you who gets killed?  ...Then?  Talking about other people's death is easy, but what about yours? She's here! She moves around you, and can get you in a thousandth of second. Because it was your day, your hour, your second...
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
Mathilda, don't resume, please. ....Change subject, OK?
What shall we do?
Friends? You're crazy!  In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
...You're young, Mathilda... You still have a chance to get out.  You can't give up this chance. You have to protect it. There's a lot of things to do in life, a lot of other jobs...
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
Well... I proposed them to play roulette...  Like we played...  ...And I lost.
...Mathilda, I don't feel like talking about this.
Stop, Mathilda! Don't talk like that!
...Yes. The day he got out of jail. I allowed him to make ten steps... No more. And bang. Two hundred meters. By telescope. That night, I left my country and came here, to join my father, who worked for Tony.  ...I was 17. Then, I never left the city...  And never had another girlfriend...
...Yes.
Yeah, what?
Good! Snipers can't be in position.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
I have no fear.
Huh? Why?
Messina.
Giancarlo... Rinaldi.
No...
You're right, son. You must care the links with your family, always.  It's the only important thing in the world.
Salute.
I respect your business, Mister Tony. Every time we asked your help, we were very happy with the result.  It's right this that makes me nervous, now.  I hope you'll excuse my temporary bad mood?
...Even his mother wouldn't.
May we have this wolf's name and address?
Where?
Why am I such an authority?
No it's not.
How serious is it?
I won't let you die.
That's enough.
Okay.
It's just a regular day.
We can do it together.
Sometimes people need to see things done for them -- because sooner or later they don't believe the words anymore.
Show me.
You like to take walks?
Don't bring it in here -- it probably has all kinds of diseases.
Where?
I'm not proving to her.  I'm showing her.  And I know I don't have to.  I want to.  I've realized, love is about giving. I'm alive, I can still give to her. I want to give her everything I can.
His name is Maurice.  He's dancing around everything else.
If he's in trouble with the law -- fine.  Not our problem.  He yanked two people from a car wreck, let's give him some space.
This guy's not a murderer.
Jumped where?
By car right?
Never have children.  If they're not a burden to you, they're a burden to someone else.
I told you.
So I've been informed.
Where am I?
Which hospital?  Did you take me back?
You ever lose somebody Stephanie?
Someone should be with you.
Forty-seven years.
What do you mean?
This isn't right.
No alcohol?
No.
No.
Of course.
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
Don't be silly?
What?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
OK.
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
We?
I warned you...  ...but I'm sorry.
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
How much, do you think?
Sorry. Look... you seem like a nice girl. I'm just sick of everyone in this town trying to get my money.
I am lonely, Yuri.
I once had to judge a Theta Chi Tighty- Whitey contest. Trust me -- I can handle anything.
I can't give you that. And if you put me on the stand, I'll lie.
That's not what's important.
Whatever it is -- it could save you.
I know! You helped me go from a six to a four!
I guess.
Because they got wet.
Who's askin'?
Due to the fact that you retained the residence, Ms. Bonafante is entitled to full ownership of the canine property in question and we will be enforcing said ownership immediately.
No, she was crying her eyes out.
Oh, yes. Mrs. Windham is the most sweet, wonderful woman I know. I have loved her since the day she hired me. She could never do something this awful. I know this because we are very close.
Just the love in my heart.
Would you be willing to stake your life on it?
Definitely! I love him!
I'm so happy for you!
Licensed attorney or family member?
You know her?
Although Mr. Huntington makes an excellent point, I have to wonder if the defendant kept a thorough record of each sperm emission made throughout his life?
I know. He has it sent out.
You think?
Why else would he be taking you to The Ivy? You've been dating for a year -- it's not like he's trying to impress you.
Serious?! Who the hell does he think he is? You're the most popular month on the USC calendar!
Thank you. I love you, too.
The professors? Yeah, they tend to do that. Socratic method.
Thanks again for your help!
She's completely untrustworthy.
She married an old man, she's made a living on telling women they're too fat, she hawks her crap on the Home Shopping Network...
You're going to trust the word of a woman who named her child after a condiment? She's ly-ing.
Law school was a mistake. Getting this internship was a mistake.
Going back to LA. Maybe I can fulfill my destiny as a useless bimbo and join the Swedish Bikini Team. No more navy blue suits. No more panty- hose. No more trying to be something I'm not.
Oh, my God!!
Are you asking me on a date?
Is he the only one?
What happened?
I changed my mind. I'd pick the dangerous one.
She was a Delta Gamma! Not in my pledge class or anything -- she graduated five years ahead of me. But I used to take her class at the LA Sports Club. She's amazing!
Has Warner Huntington checked in yet?
I mean, we're having a lot of fun now -- but things are gonna be different when I'm at Harvard. Law school is a completely different world. I need to be serious.
You're breaking up with me because I'm too -- blonde?
No.
Harvard. Law school.
I feel like we've barely spent any time together since we got here.
Am I on glue, or did I not get into the same law school you did, Warner?
Are you serious?
Why do you say that?
Nay.  This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
I know no more of shame than I do of fear.  I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
Do it now!
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Well, er... no.  I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
It's terrible.
I need your help.  In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles.  I --
Gump, is it?
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Please don't misunderstand.  I am grateful for your hospitality and --
Aye.  Black Baron's mischief.
Time for a champion.  Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
I know where to find it.  Taking possession be another matter.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
Better we eat him than the other way round.
Something's coming.
It would appear so.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Something the matter?
Very secretive, they are.  Keep their feet covered up.  Best if you don't mention it.
Stay on your guard, Jack.  The bug is enchanted surely.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
The chill is worse this night.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we?  For all the dark magic protecting it.
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers.  Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow.  Shoot the damned things as they fly.
Will you chance a miss?
I don't... understand.
In the dark, lad?  Why should he do that?
Mean you to seek him out below?
I admire your valor, Jack.  By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
Don't get too far!
Hush up, Screwball.  Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
No, no, no... this is different!
Screwball!  Be quiet...!  We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
They've fired the moat!
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Only were he a fool to boot.  See yon viper?
Be patient.
I'll go search for it.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
You've freed me, Jack...
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Pinching me!
His feet shall never cross my lips.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross.  All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
Be fair, Oona.
I think she's about to foal.
Watch behind or I'll never collect on it!
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
No speeches!  What's a little swim after sticking worms and ogres?
Oh, but I have.
I'm sending you back to Hell!
To Castle Couer de Noir?
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
Mom said I should.
I don't think Dad wants you home.
What color?
And why was the alarm on?
Uh...using Josh like that.
No.
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
He jumped into the ocean.
You look better without make-up.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
Really?
No thanks.
I'm sorry.  I'm just here to shower.
Hand me a towel.  I'm getting out.
Why are you so stupid?
I'm not gay.
Okay.  I guess.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
From Tuesday to yesterday, not including Monday or today.  Okay...Mrs. Dokos is repeatedly running over her lawn.  The Corliss' have attributed the increase in rat population in their environs to the state of your...structure.
He builds models for architects.  His dad, on the other hand, was the real deal.  Designed and built the coolest houses I've ever seen.
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
Maybe that's too long.
I hate this job.
Yes, it is.
Thanks, I'd like that.  Thank you.
Thank you.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You'll know me by the time we're through.
You don't have a choice.
I'd blame you.  I want you here.
It'll be fine.
You'll have money when you work for it.
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
The game was to make me smaller than he was.  No matter what.  He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller.  So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football.  If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough.  If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho.  I never won the game.  Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
We haven't build shit.  You're just tearing down your father.
How do you become something you're not?
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
After everything he did to you and your mom?
Absolutely.  Have him put it on a separate line.  At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here?  Trying to get me to like you.
Good for you.
I'd build a house.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
Check the permits.  It was built as a guesthouse.  It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I haven't forced him to work.  I only wet him down once.  Why would he leave?
She needs to be alone, I think.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
Let's go.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
Hindsight.  It's like foresight without a future.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
What did I say?
You bit my finger.
Left you?
What did he say?
It's not my back that's killing me.
Don't even...I'm there.
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
I could use the money.
Is Lois still here?  I'm starved.
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it?
What are you doing home?
I never asked for more.
Please don't leave me.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Take it off.
Do you like red?
No.
Yeah.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.  Maybe it's what I want.
Can we really help build a house?
Yes, it is.
Nigger.
Thought you'd never ask. Biscuit needs some gravy.
I did, Claude. I mentioned you. I mentioned you both. But the fact is, pardons don't come cheap. The kid can hit. What can you do?
Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie?
But I'm not on the outside. I'm in here.
Over forty years now. Me and Ray Gibson out there.
Yes, sir.
You think you could make an exception just this once, boss? She came all the way down from New York.
Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself.
That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it?
Of course I did. He said he'd file an appeal right away. You didn't tell me he was so good looking.
He seemed like a pretty good lawyer to me. His offices take up an entire floor of that big, new building on 125th Street, and he was using all these words I never heard before. He even offered me a job.
Ray Gibson?  No, no. He's the reason I'm in here, Daisy. For all I know, he's got a record a mile long. I got a better shot of getting out of here on my own. You tell Maynard to think about me, concentrate on me. Understand?
I really shouldn't. I gotta keep an eye on my friend.
Claude Banks.
You went to Monroe?
I don't know. Bank teller. Sounds like ladies work to me.
There is no Boom-Boom Room.
Oooh...
That jelly you were talking to right here?
That was mighty charitable of you, Claude. Looks like we both got fucked tonight.
He even got my daddy's watch.
Life?! What's life mean? There's no way I can do life. I got a job starts Monday morning!
Somebody just told me he wins the three-legged race every year.
Gimme that. That doesn't concern you.
Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude?
I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft.
Hell, you'd probably be half way to New York by now...
He'd be doing me a favor. I'm getting outta here one way or the other! Goddamn rats and shit! Fuck!
Sure, it says Allie Reynolds right here in the program. He's warming up right now. Man, we're so close to the field I need cleats. How'd you get such good seats?
Ketchup? Who eats ketchup on a hot dog? Mustard's what you want.
All right, grab the bat. Let's see what you can do.
My plan is on his way to Pittsburgh right now. That congenital idiot just got himself a pardon signed by the governor thanks to us, but we can't seem to do nothing for ourselves. Don't you feel a little disgusted right now?
I ain't getting in no airplane with you. I'm finally wrapping my mind around the concept. They threw us in this shithole for life. Don't you get it, Ray? We're gonna die here! Might as well head up to the cemetery, pick a plot and start digging.
I didn't do if for you, anyway. I just ain't no boot-licking trusty, that's all.
That was five years ago.
You sure looked funny running for those pies, bullets flying all around you.
He's just a lonely old man. He likes to talk.
Goodnight, Ray.
And what will we do when we get there? I'm sixty-five years old, Ray. So are you. What are we gonna do out here? Get married, have kids, settle down? That boat sailed without us, man.
Forget about that. You run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.
I ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.
He's got my daddy's watch, Claude. I always knew whoever took that watch killed Winston Hancock. And that was you, Mr. Pike.
You don't want to hear it, you don't want to hear it. There's no shame in that.
You didn't get ketchup?
Yeah? You and what army?
I'm all right.
Grandma Dodi's Pork Rib Joint.
Made just for you, Cookie.
My corn bread? Oh no, my friend. I love corn bread.
No, they didn't get their pardons, you dumb shit! If they'd got their pardons way back then, we wouldn't be burying them today, would we?
I heard some things so I went to see Spanky Johnson. He told me what happened and gave me some money to get down here. What happened to your face?
He must still be in there.
I'm going in for him. He'd do the same for me.
I prefer bourbon.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to teach this uppity nigger a lesson in manners.
Are you offering me a bribe?
They're called subways. A nickel will take you from one end of Manhattan to the other. Helluva ride, too.
Greenville, that the nearest town?
Sure I've been to the Cotton Club. It's pretty sweet. But it don't hold a candle to the Boom Boom Room. That's where the real action is.
Me? Willie Long.
I'm talking about old Satchmo nearly blew the roof off the joint.
You found him.
That's Natchez-under-the-Hill.
Green's the only color that matters under the hill. They got gambling, girls. You oughta check it out.
But you do. What does that say about you, Ray? What does that say about me? I've given you a lot of leeway over the years on account of your father. But he didn't last long enough to teach you the meaning of the word respect so I guess I'm gonna have to school you myself.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Absolutely not.
And he's dead serious.
You mother...
You want a queen? Got one right here.
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
You're already there...
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
It's not me, moron.
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
C'mon, man, I'm just asking for one Superbowl ring.
Yes, Jimmy.
Oh, and don't forget, you're shoving a pineapple up Hitler's ass at four o'clock.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
What was it called, sir.
I gotta say this cake tastes a little funny.
By she, do you mean he?
'Bout time...
Gotta be one of his disciples or something.
Should we wake him up?
We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?
Peppermint... alright.
That way.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then. Later on.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
Really?
My dad's an optometrist.
"Octopus people?"
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
I have to, Valerie.
I love you.
Right. And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy.  Aren't you boiling in that outfit?
I cut up a Sandman yesterday. They said I'd never get him... but I cut him up good, I did.
Nothing will happen! I make the rules as I go!! Cubs do what I say! Always have! Always will! I got Cathedral and I'll never let go!
Where do you send them?
Let me sculpt you and I will show you where the others have gone.
Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.  It's all here -- ready -- fresh as harvest day. Fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea... And then it stopped coming and they...  ...came instead. So I store them here. I'm ready. And you're ready. It's my Job -- protein, plankton, grass from the sea.
Turn this way.  No, no... not you... YOU!
Has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?
Well... you can't have them all.
I'm fine...  See you...
Holly. Holly! Please... The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after --
...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him...
Here.
Please... No.
Nothing. I felt sad, I put myself on the circuit. It was a mistake.
He was killed.
No.
I'm the most beautiful woman you've ever seen, I suppose?
You know.
All right.
I'm going to run.
Both... running's what I'm interested in.
And I never heard of Sanctuary.
What do you need?
You're not going, are you?
Muscle? I don't know that one.
It's brighter there... besides, we can't go back.
It doesn't make any difference anymore.
I guess so... I know I felt something I never felt before... and I didn't like it... not a bit.  I'll tell you one thing... Sanctuary better be worth it. That's the last place for me to live now.
Why don't we rest here? We know we can eat these.
Do you think he was telling the Truth?
Thirty thousand years didn't last very long, did they?
The Lifeclocks have no power outside.
"Beloved Husband". "Beloved Wife". What can all that mean?
To what?
Yes. You and I, Jessica. 
Sanctuary is the right to live... nothing more. But nothing less, either...
Yes...
Mother and Father said so... you know?
I don't know.
All this. All of it.
We'll remember. But that's a long time off...
Where are you going?
What a pity. I was hoping you'd be here to bury me.
More... many more.
I don't know. The cheeks maybe... look a little --
Too little.
You don't seem quite sure, Jessica.  Can you do it? Will you?
Okay.
This is our bedroom.
What is?
Maid? Relative?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
Or not so recently?
You know what I think?
I don't know.
Over there.
We should stop seeing each other.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
Okay.
What if Andy tips off Mr. Eddy?
Alice, I...
Feeling good, Arnie. Ready to get to work.
Sure.
Sure, Arnie. Bring 'em on, I'm ready.
Nice to know they can't seem to get along without ya.
Sit down a minute.
Yeah? what did they want?
But I don't remember anything. What did you tell 'em?
No.
The wife killer?
All right... but you see our predicament... Legally we can't hold him, but he may be able to help us... perhaps later.  For now, he's free to leave.
You came home. Your friend Sheila brought you here.
Nothing, Marsh. Vanished. There's an APB out on him. His photo's been faxed nationwide.
We'll get a tail put on him.
You say you haven't seen your son since the day before yesterday?
I don't know yet.
A headache?
SIX FUCKIN' CAR LENGTHS... THAT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND SIX FUCKIN' FEET, MISTER! YOU WERE FOLLOWING TEN FEET BEHIND ME... IF I'D HAD TO STOP SUDDENLY, YOU WOULD HAVE HIT ME. I WANT YOU TO GET A DRIVER'S MANUAL, AND I WANT YOU TO STUDY THAT MOTHERFUCKER... AND I WANT YOU TO OBEY THE GOD DAMN RULES. FIFTY FUCKIN' THOUSAND PEOPLE WERE KILLED ON THE ROAD LAST YEAR.  CAUSE OF FUCKIN' ASSHOLES LIKE YOU. TELL ME YOU'RE GONNA GET A MANUAL.
Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
Tenor... Tenor saxophone. Do you...
But my head...
A videotape.
No, nothing.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
Called? When?
Just a minute.
He's got some fucked up friends.
I wouldn't... The brain would know what's going on. Your heart would be ripped open trying to pump blood, blood pouring into the chest cavity. Savage pain, Marian.
No, no... It's okay, Mr. Eddy.
Thanks, Mr. Eddy... whatiya need? Just the regular tune-up?
All right!
Fifteen car lengths. About two hundred and seventy feet.
Pornos?
What?
I don't remember... What happened that night?
Whatiya mean?
It was weird...
I do like you, Sheila.
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
What's the BITCH'S name?!
Yes. Might as well - all of it.
Let me have it.  "Aboard the S.S. Manchuria. Last night Conway seemed to recover his memory. Kept talking about Shangri- La, telling a fantastic story about a place in Tibet. Insisted upon returning there at once. Locked him in room but he escaped us and jumped ship during night at Singapore. Am leaving ship myself to overtake him, as fearful of his condition. Wrote down details of Conway's story about Shangri-La which I am forwarding. Lord Gainsford."
She's remaining in her room. She isn't feeling very well.  Now please go on without me. I eat very little.
It's always been a source of deep regret, but the mountains surrounding us have made reception almost impossible.
A paleontologist.
This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
Good morning—
Well, it's a good morning, anyway.
Well, you just reverse it. Your left hand is—  What difference does it make what 'hand' you are? The north is the north!
Now you're irritating and absurd!
Please don't call me Lovey.
All the conveniences for the condemned, if you ask me.
I'm thinking.
Yes.
Sounds like a stall to me.
Just call me Barney.
Okay, Lovey.
They're very nice people - except that they've got horns.
So that's where you are. I might of known it. No wonder you couldn't hear me.
I'm going to sleep in my bed. Come on, Lovey!
Come on, Lovey.
In a quandary.
Plumbing. Everything modern. I'm going to run pipes all through the village—
Please! Please! Do not wait for me! I eat so very little.
Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
Say, listen - will you go and annoy the rest of your playmates? Let me alone!
You have no disputes over women?
A Belgian priest by the name of Father Perrault, the first European to find this place, and a very great man indeed. He is responsible for everything you see here. He built Shangri-La, taught our natives, and began our collection of art. In fact, Shangri-La is Father Perrault.
The only one.
It's weird.  Chang, how old are you?
No doctors?  That's fine. That's just fine.
Sure, you can help me! You can help me jump over that cliff! I've been looking and looking at the bottom of that mountain, but I haven't got the nerve to jump!
Well, we've been expecting this particular shipment for the past two years.
I'm sure you were. When would you like to start?
Thank you.
How can we get in touch with them?
Now, my dear boy. You shouldn't—
Father Perrault is dead.
Personally, I've enjoyed your community very much. But my friends do not care for this mystery. They are determined to leave as soon as—
Oh, the girl at the piano?
I knew you'd understand. That's why I came to you for help.
Mine?
Do you think this will come in my time?
Right, Bob.
Come on! Quick! This way.
Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
Yes.
Thanks.  I suppose all this comes under the heading of adventure.
What are you talking about?
Nothing about the porters yet?
Good heavens, Bob, we've been here two weeks and we haven't found out a thing.
Porters?
George. George - do you mind? I'm sorry, but I can't talk about it tonight.
You can't leave, George.
You mustn't. You've got to stay here now.
So you think I'm mad?
George, I may be wrong, I may be a maniac. But I believe in this, and I'm not going to lose it.  You know how much I want to help you, but this is bigger, stronger if you like than brotherly love. I'm sorry, George. I'm staying.
You're wrong, George.
I don't believe it! I don't believe a word of it!
There's nothing that would suit them better than to lose us, but we must go on.  Come on.
As long as they keep on aiming at us, we're safe.  Come now, child.
We'd be eternally grateful if you—
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
You're absolutely right. And I had to come all the way to a pigeon house in Shangri-La to find the only other person in the world who knew it. May I congratulate you?
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
Oh, you're going to make life very simple.
Bump?
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
I'd love it!
I tell you, we're going west, and Shanghai is east of here!
I don't know. I'm a paleontologist, not a Foreign Secretary.
Mountain grass. It's good, too. Here, have some. I've read of people lasting thirty days on this stuff.
English!
Go? Where?
Oh, my dear boy, I'm sorry. That's impossible. Why, I have my classes all started.
Please don't go.
I'm sorry.  I haven't even got any cigarettes left!
You'll tell me some of the things I want to know, won't you?  You'll tell me who runs this place. And why we were kidnapped. And what they're going to do with us!
Cowan--
It means I know you think you got a beat on things.  But trust me, you don't.  You don't even have an inkling of a hint of a clue as to what's really going on in the world.    And if you want to find out even a little, you'll shut up and come with me. And if you don't, fine.  Go with them. Cause I'm not interested in breaking in another little hot-shot only to have him wig or die on me just when I'm starting to count on him.  So forgive me if you don't exactly hear me ringing little bells and whistling welcome aboard, but this isn't the Love Boat.  And I'm not Captain Fucking Stubing.  Now I'm sorry.  But this has been one long, bad day.
I guess I lost:
And Goodwill Toward Man?
And if I say yes?
I... I don't know, air.  This guy. Mr. "Best of the best of the best... " I don't know.  It's just still find it a little...  humorous.  I'm sorry.  Sir.
I'd go with number three.
Kay...
We wear black.
It's the way we do it.  The way we've always done it.
Such a shame, too.  Cause you made such a good impression the first time.
I taught kindergarten.
You don't know me at all.
If it was just a meal, why did they have so much luggage?
I guess it's simple, huh?  They're either gone... or dead.
History's proven that where there's a nitrogenizer, there's a 12-legged signazoid.  They use it to make our food digestible for their systems.
There's gotta be a hundred pawn shops in downtown Philadelphia.  I take it there's a reason we're going to this one.
That's the Loch Ness Monster.  And... Kay-- that's... 444-Eyes?
Get back in the car!
I know you don't trust him.  You don't trust anybody--
That's my point.  For thirty years you've been looking through things and under things and behind things. Well what I'm saying is maybe this is a time where you should look right at things.  He said our enemy in already here.  Well maybe it is.  Maybe our enemy is, literally, already here.
Do his job.
Actually, it is a shotgun.  Hold onto it--
Kay!?
And I almost got digested. It goes with the job.
But it's definitely a nest, isn't it?
Actually... I don't know.
Out of focus?
The only thing I could think of would be... you'd have to get rid of the queen.
Nowhere, huh? odd you'd get all dressed up like that just to be going nowhere.
It's... coming.
Nope.  Nothing at all.
They're not my pals--
What if I don't?
Tell us the truth.  You don't just find these things, at least not in this neighborhood.
Yeah.  Nov I know it looks normal, but watch this.
Highway 119, just west of Smith. Why?
What the hell is going on?
Dee?  What are you doing here?
I got a planet check on that bug.  It's from way the hell out in the third belt. it's organic, formed in the same blast that made our solar system.
Anderton, leave.
Because I found out about her...
Yeah --
Because my mother gave them to me. What do you care?  They're no good to you on the secondary market anyway.
Yes, you did.
How do I find the --
I can't even stand up --
No, you're not in trouble.  I'm interested in a murder.
This about the Justice Department?  They laid on a tour for tomorrow a.m.  Told me to wear a tie.  You like this one?
This is the official composite of the three precogs?
Show me just Agatha's data stream.
I work graveyard, swing and day all by my lonesome.
On account of those are not his eyes.  He had 'em swapped out to fool the scanners.
Don't worry, Lamar.
Lamar, I'm sorry.  I don't know what --
Yes, sir.
He's not.  He's looking for a flaw in us, John.
What?
Justice already knows.  Talk to me, John.  Tell me what's happening?
The brick has been repointed, the glass is original with new glazing bars.  I show composite mouldings with dentils.  Someone took care in the renovation.  Let's find the architect...
Did he close the front door?
Any ID on the shooter yet?
Sure, Chief.  I think I'll grab one for myself while I'm at it...
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
Why don't you cut the cute act, Danny, and tell me exactly what it is you're looking for?
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you been doping on all night.
Wally.  This is Danny Witwer.  He's from Justice and we're to give him a full run of the farm.
It could have been a nightmare... Sometimes they dream about the old murders.
Rufus.  She's a precog.
Tell me how.
That's great.
I feel bad about that.  I need you to forgive me.
Once I even told him I loved him.
Good-bye, Dad...
He's alive?
No.
If I tell you, my family gets nothing.
I'm not.  I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.  After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt?  It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow.  Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
Inside the Precog who predicted it.  All you have to do is download it.
If... you have one.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
The female.
You look great.
We know why John was tagged.
Sean --
The Mets.  John doesn't think they've got a deep enough pitching roster this year, and I'm inclined to agree.
What?
Not quite.
Yes.
Shhh.  You know what I hear?
Not after the vote next week.  Once the Amendment passes, we go national, there's gonna be nowhere to run.
Actually, Gordon, you're not gonna do that.  I'm taking control of the team.
We can stop him.
I don't know, why?
They could have been put away. Anderton could have found them.
Knott!
Sure.  Raincheck.
Yes.
I don't have any cream.  Sorry.
Thank you.  He hasn't tried to contact you?
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  I regret ever saying that.
The FBI found something that belonged to my son.  A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
To what?  Trap him?
What does he want with a precog?
What are you talking about?
You're Bobby, right?
Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
We have snifters
What's 'incidentals?'
Is it a good room?
Here. Take it. Bring me back eighty.
So?
What if I gave you forty?
Manhattan.
Somebody's getting comfortable.
He's okay.
I don't know. Do whatever you want.
Bullshit.
Mommy's not home?
If they asked for her, they're probably expecting blowjobs all around.
Who's watching the baby?
They're not too classy to have tits rubbed in their face.
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
Shhh. He'll hear you.
How could you let her see this?
Tell you the truth, I don't give a shit for me. But that little girl is so special, and you're gonna fuck her up.
What'd you say?
I had a fight up at Sportsman's.
5-5-1.
Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
Was gonna be tomorrow morning. Now, who knows?
This Welsh dude is tripping on Ruiz cause he's a Shot Caller.
He was uptown when I paged him. I gave him the address. He's meeting us there.
She was fast, huh?
That's why they call it the smart money.
Mr. Reuben, I swear to God, they were out of line.
Yeah.
Ruiz knows about this?
He'll work it off.
How 'bout this. If you're in, he's in.
Do me a favor. Think about it. Is that too much too ask?
What is it?
I hate to ruin your fairy tale, but I've been paying Jess' rent for six months. She's got to keep dancing --
Where's the drop?
Yeah. You're staying at the Soho Grand. You got anything checked?
Soho.
No. That's cool, man.
Yeah.
Don't know much. I hear he runs a tight ship.
Don't be shitty.
I got no idea.
Then why do you try to get in?
He didn't say we need guns.
Why do you always get stuck taking care of the kid.
I tried your ATM PIN. I gotta kill an hour. Let's grab a beer.
See? Now everyone's got one on.  What do you got there?
What's the movie?
Nah, don't bother --
You sure?
Yeah, I guess.
But let me tell you, man, I don't like your attitude already.
We just got moved up in the world. You gotta let go of that blue collar mentality that was drummed into your head. You gotta start owning it man, or they'll smell you a mile away like a cheap suit.
Well, I don't want to walk.
You know he fucks all his girls, don't you?
His names Horrace. Horrace, this is Ricky Slade.
What do you give a shit what he calls us? He's not our friend. Let's just get this shit over with and go home. What's this place we're going to, Jimmy?
About what?
Work's over. I'm gonna party.
Is it so unrealistic to think Ruiz, who doesn't even want us here, is throwing us to the wolves? As an apology? And I don't even know what we're dropping off or picking up --
The what?
We don't need guns.
I listened extremely carefully. Nothing was even vaguely implied. He even laughed in your face when you asked him
You wouldn't even know where to get one.
What happened to the fifteen hundred?
I did! I paid for half the fuckin drinks!
This is horseshit. It coulda been so easy.
And you grew up in Manhattan?
That's a good idea, maybe I will!
You want your surprise?
I'm just warning you, I can't swim.
How is it you're good? You on a list?
S'up.
Yeah, uh, what's the movie?
Yes.
Jimmy knows. 13th Street. We'll meet you there.
Why? What I say bad?
I'll tell him someone else told me.
Watch it...
Does anyone want another?
I hear the China Club is a laugh.
I've heard you've got the best coke in the States. The shit back home is pants.
Don't worry, man. It's all for you.
How's it going?
That's alright, man. It's a little early for me to drink.
No, man, that's fine. Just put that you took delivery.
You think this shit's funny, Ho?
We're square.
And the money. Where do we bring the money?
Because you lost my fucking carpet cleaning van and I don't like you.
What, motherfucker? You drinking 'the witch' after dinner?
Will you tell Peter Jennings to shut up and fucking listen. The shit's as routine as you get. I coulda turned it over offshore in a week, but Maxie likes to do it all his way. Safe. I coulda dropped the bag alone. It's only two hundred G's. But he sent you all. So I can either send you home and tell Maxie, or we can flush the toilet one more time and hope it all goes down.
Well, word on the street is you're Welsh.
Who's up for a night on the town.
Red, and I ain't no punk.
Heard where?
My papa taught me one thing: don't never bullshit a West Indian bullshit artist.
Yeah, and I'm putting my money where my ugly mouth is. I'm putting you back in the numbers right now.  Baby, what's today?
I'll take your goddam bet.
You din't have no 1, 2, 8.
I wasn't gonna shoot you, baby. It was just my rep, that's all. And don't shit me now, but did you have that number? Tell me.
I can show you how to get out of prison. And it's no hype.
'Cause you needed it. 'Cause you couldn't hear me without it.
When you go busting your fists against a stone wall, you're not using your brains. Cause that's what the white man wants you to do. Look at you.
I ain't said I'm ashamed.
Tell you this: you ain't no fool.
Start at the beginning. Page one, the first one. Here --
Then the devil is white.
I sure met some.
All praises are due to Allah. Thank you, Brother Minister.
Next week, Brother Minister.
And now, without further remarks, I present to you one who is willing to put himself on the line for you --
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
So it is not a matter of the breeding conditions or preparation of the meat. The meat itself is foul.
I can handle it.
Are you?
What have you set your mind to?
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
There are always slanders, always lies. You're reading the devil's lies. Can't you see they're trying to bring us down, bring down the Messenger.
Woman, have you lost your mind? What's the matter with you?
Is that what this is about? Material wealth?
Shhh!
Dear heart, I love you.
Don't answer the phone. It's all right. It's all right. Nothing is gonna happen to anybody.
Malcolm, where are you? We've been calling all over the city.
Is my family here yet?
But we do know that the people of that region of Asia Minor, from the Tigris-Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, are dark-skinned people. I've studied drawings and photographs and seen newsreels. I have never seen a native of that area who was not black.
Please, go ahead.
Women are deceitful. They are untrustworthy flesh. I've seen too many men ruined or tied down or messed up by women.
What?
With him?
I know where you're going.
All them books you read and you still don't know nuthin.
All of your children are delinquent, Mrs. Little, and one, at least, Malcolm is a thief.
You'll regret this, Mrs. Little.
How long has this been going on?
What does Sidney say?
What's your story, baby?
Me?
Lemme feed you, sweetie, while they hot.
Well, bitch you move too slow.
Baby, I got to let this old man win. Keep the faith, and tell Billie I'll see her later.
Shorty, this is Laura.
The hell you are.
I've been clean for twelve years, Shorty.
How's the rest of the gang? You seen anyone?
What can you do?
So what about him?
Brothers of Brother Johnson.
He told you that?
Allah will provide.
Am I a suspect?
What do you want?
Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
[South America.]
[It's a permit to carry a gun in Columbia. The gun you're about to find in that suitcase.]
I show, you give me the information?
[Daniel what?]
[So am I, Sister.]
[Not for a long time, sister.]
[I believe you.]
[Me, too. Tell me about the guardians.]
[How do I recognize him.]
[I want you.]
[Your brother wants to talk to you.]
[Her life for your life.]
[And?]
[You stole the drop.]
[Don't lie to me!]
I'll probably kill them. Is that likely?
Creasy??? Where the fuck are you?
I came to visit you.
A bodyguard... Who's the guy?
You got tossed. Don't trust the cops, especially the Judicials.  Oh you know that?
Sorry I woke you, Ray.
Yes or no?
Time will tell.
That's right.
No.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
No, that was in Columbia.
No.
Could I stop you?
That's not a question.
Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears.
The food's fine. Sometimes I don't eat.
You're paying me to protect her, not amuse her. Right?
Because...  I was already dead.
Stay here. If you do something stupid, we won't get her back.
Her beauty fucks with your mind.
She understands men.
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
This is Mr. Creasy.
[He sounded strong to me. Stronger than we are.]
[Creasy is not a policeman. My sense is he could be very valuable to us.]
[It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.]
[And left three more dead men.]
[I should start going for your tits first.]
You just said it. He's my friend. Nothing else to say.
This is my jurisdiction. I want these men as much as Creasy does.
I plan to. I'll even help him if I can. He's going to lead me to the 'The Dreamer'. Someone I want very badly. But I'd like to understand him. Give me that.
She's all right, Andy. It's just that I get one Saturday night off every three weeks, and I was expecting something better, that's all.
All right, I'm having a fair time. It's just that I get one Saturday night off in three weeks, and I wanted to wind up with something tonight.
What?
Listen. You people go grab a table. I'll be back inna minute. I'll be right back.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Yeah, sure.
Where?
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
We just talked.
Angie. He says she was a real scrawny- looking thing.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
I'm having a very good time, too.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Thank you.
Yes, I know.
I don't.
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
Yes, I know.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
I'll wait for your call.
Nothing.
How do you do?
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Yeah. I was just asking you if you was here stag or with a girl.
I'll take you over, and I'll introduce you as an old army buddy of mine, and then I'll cut out. Because I got this other girl waiting for me out by the hatcheck, and I'll pay you five bucks.
Well, I bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.
Boy, that Mickey Spillane, he sure can write.
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
Sure.
She didn't look Italian to me.
Hey, Ang'...
You want a beer, Ang'?
Hiya, Ralph...
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking. 
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
I just can't stand it any more! Every minute of the day! Do this! Do that! I don't have ten minutes privacy with my husband! We can't even have a fight! We don't have no privacy! Everybody's miserable in our house!
Sure, sure.
Tommy, I promised the babysitter six o'clock.
I'll see you at mass tomorrow. We'll sit down and we'll discuss the whole thing.
Why do you always put me inna position of being the louse?
I don't wanna hear anymore about it, you hear me?
Waddaya talking about?!!
I told her she could use the kitchen any time she wanted...
What is, Red, the intention or the act?
Never this close.
Just one for a start.
You fixing to add overtime to a twelve- hour day? The union ain't gonna like it.
Well...  I was going to name you Chief Surgeon...  To consult on both shifts, yours and Frank's.
Sure, you just blindfold him first and tie him to a stake.
Home.
Where you think you are, boy? They probably never seen a olive in this country.
Pour one for Painless.
Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
...No cases over the age of temptation but deliver us eight. from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and...
What's there to do? You found the sliver.
Duke Forrest.
Georgia, where I come from, it's real if you make it yourself. But I been buying from the Yankee Government since they put me in this soldier suit and give me a rate.
That's right, pal. You just sit up front and sign the mail, and leave the cutting to us.
Except we forgot one other small thing.
This outfit needs somebody who can find his way around the pulmonary anatomy when the bases are loaded.
You met him. Walt Waldowski, the Dental Officer.
What's he got to write, for God's sake?
You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
All three of us played for our schools. And there are at least four other guys...
I don't think I could hurt one of them with a sledgehammer.
And I'm grateful for you, Frank, especially with those boors around. We've grown very close in a short time.
Shut up or I'll tear you apart.
A football game?
At ease. Captain Pierce, you have a seriously wounded patient for whom you are responsible. Yet I find you in a poker game.
I want to talk to you, Pierce.
All you have to do is ask.  The quarterback is saying they'll run the old Statue of Liberty. Their left end will come across and take the ball out of his hand and try to get around our left end.
We need medical officers for short- arm inspection starting the first afternoon out.
Oh, I'm not sailing with you. I work out of the hospital here.
If you don't know what you've seen, why should I?
As far as the greens maybe. I don't know if my putting would come back or not, without some practice.
So let's haul ass, Sergeant.
Radar!
Be kind of rough on him if there's no blood. Why don't we close up and sit on him a couple of days?
They're coming.
We can balance that by getting ourselves a ringer. Henry has to say he needs a neurosurgeon and put in a specific request for Dr. Oliver Harmon Jones.
Not necessarily.
Honey, nobody as pretty as you could ever impose... please sit down. Coffee?
I think we could still have a chance.
No, let's stick to that strategy till we see whether you boys can do two things. The first is get that halfback out of the game. He had one year with the Rams before the Army got him, but he didn't play too often because he's one of those hot dogs.
It isn't always this rough?
Ayuh.
That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship.  Poor baby.
Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
It happens to be a matter of life and death.
I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
Thanks, Reverend. Thank you both for tipping me off.  You don't know a Captain Forrest or a Captain Pierce, do you?
Well, one of the girls got careless and two days ago she gave birth to an eight-pound American-Japanese male.
Every time we feed him, it either comes right back up or he coughs and turns blue and has a hell of a time.
That's what you've been doing all these years with every dame you could lay your hands on? Repressing your real self?
That. It's out of the act.
Right, Ho-Jon. See you later.
Finest kind. Captain Forrests say you better haul ass home quick. We got new chest-cutter in our tent.
If you mean...  She is a lieutenant in the Army Nursing Corps, Captain.
That's all the commitment you're offering me?  Or do you have some more extravagant gesture of cooperation?
There's no reason good enough for one medical officer to strike another.
You got to relax, Henry. Since the deluge started, you been working in the OR and running the outfit, too.
You mean who hit who?
I'll tell you my news. I'm retiring from football.
Yes, sir?
Don't come so quickly when I call. I want you to take these officers...
Stop that, O'Rielly!
Oh, get out of here!
Morning, Captain.
The way I run an organization, any man in it has the right to speak his mind.
It's an American boy's rupture you're supposed to close.
No, we had a clear soup to start. This is a thick one and you ought to taste it. There's nothing like it back home.
But it's ten-thirty at night. We can't get military personnel out for a civilian. A foreign civilian.
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
With all of it?
Against what?
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
John Doe, the one in the speech.
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
Hello.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Me?
No, thank you.
I guess so. Then what happened?
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
Thirty dollars.
And, Miss Mitchell—I think from now on you'd better work directly with me.
Go ahead, open it, open it.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
Wait a minute . . .
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers—start arguments.
There is no letter.
In what man!
What John Doe?
So?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract? 
I got it all ready. Here.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me.
Yeah, a little.
Uh-huh. Till my wing[4] went bad.
The heelots!
Old man Delaney has been bringing his furniture over to my place at night, one piece at a time, and selling it.
Yeh. Er, and my boss, Mr. Schwabacker made a job in his warehouse for old man Delaney—
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account!
You bet I will! As fast as I can! Gonna get some canned goods—a fishing rod, and the rest I'm gonna give away.
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh?  Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
John Doe Club?
Yeah, you bet!
How?
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late.
No, I didn't.
No.
It's not a lie! Nickels and dimes! To stuff into their own pockets! You can read all about it in the newspapers there!
Were you paid for it—or weren't you?
Did you want to see her about something important?
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again.
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth.
Shh!
You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.
"Phoney Frank"? Don't waste your time. He'd tell you his granny was in on the Kennedy assassination if he could dodge a collar.
Fuck the stereo. What's that smell?
It was Warriors plus 6 this morning.
I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
Man, what's this about? Ya know, you were robbing a store. It wasn't personal. It was his job.
Whoa!... The government. They control everybody's mind. You're too fucking stupid to know that?
They want Walter dead!
I need to get something straight first.
Johnny Hawkins. Bail Bonds. I gotta be over at county in fifteen minutes, alright?
...get 'em, he's going to start shooting hostages in five minutes...
You'll get it. But, Joe, I want you to do something for me. Let me take a look around inside. Make sure everybody's okay.
I'm not wearing a wire. This is just between you and me.
Only at the very end.
A little exercise in lateral thinking. The obvious solution isn't always the only solution... See you tomorrow.
Been to Toronto. My mother was born there.
I don't gamble.
Explain how that works.
I think I can handle that one.
I'm not good at lying.
Okay, stop.
That's okay. That's his style.
To run late!
You live with it... and they haunt you. It doesn't leave.
You've got to decide that for yourself.
You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
You worship yourself.
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
What do you want from me?
I was going to catch the last half on TV.
Yeah that's it.
Veronica, it's not easy for me... I don't know if I can change overnight. But what I'm telling you is that I want to share everything with you, because I don't ever want to be without you again.
...Let me just show you.
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
A deeper level?
Cozy Girl in front by a neck... Now a head...
Define concern.
Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
Impound isn't a rent-a-car company.
What happened to your Trans Am?
Who's running it!
I need to take back what's mine.
Okay...
To live forever.
Nothing, go back to sleep.
Not my problem.
Yes.
It's not real.
We're going to have to reconfigure.
Go!
Christoph had spinal cancer.  His body kept rejecting gene therapy. He was desperate.  It was him, it wasn't us --
It's not used for anything.
Good question.
Try harder.
No.
-- Katie.
Who are you?!
Her?
Once they digitized you, they added it.
Yes.
Sorry?!
There?
Checking connection.
-- Waiter.
Access established.
If we don't try, Zordon won't survive!
I've never been this sore in my life.
What does that mean?!
I am the crane, agile and sublime!
We can take these guys!
There's enough for everybody!
You want me to place a few calls?
Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire.
Activating Power Scope!
What's going on?!
And I ain't no nigger either!
The Bismark in Chicago. You familiar?
Tell me about it.
Poor, yeah.
Tell me something, Meyer. How can you get up at dawn to walk on the beach if you're on your honeymoon?
You scare me, Charlie.
What's that divided four ways?
You havin' any luck findin' out who did him?
He was around...
If he's gonna fuck me up the ass!
What are ya thinkin', Charlie?
I needed to see you again.
It's a mask.
As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
I'm supposed to be at my old man's for Christmas dinner at eight.
And if we don't invite Maranzano, we can't invite Masseria. Guys don't wanna be choosin' sides.
Is there a fuckin' point comin' up anytime soon?
They don't give a shit about us!
Maranzano will think Masseria ordered the hit, and won't have no choice but to start the war.
Masseria won't have any choice but to trust you. And as long as we keep the Boss alive, Maranzano can't win without you.
Yeah. And no more Tommy Reina.
Yeah. Yeah. I bet ya feed Maranzano that same line.
What's with the banquet? This is supposed to be a private meet.
He'll know you were smart enough to stay away, Boss.
You know that if you come, we gotta invite Maranzano.
Wassa matter, Mr. Big Shot. Don't have time for my business no more?
That little party's gonna make you a lotta money.
How can I trust you when you look at me like that?
Not if they all die at once.
But that's an hour's drive.
Come on, Charlie. We got business.
I must know more of you, my son.
Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
Sittin' around gives me the piles. You got a proposition?
What about the share.
The guy doin' the job names the price. If you don't like it, you can kill Masseria yourself.
What makes you think I give a damn about that Sicilian crap?
We can operate around these guys.
Talk English. Okay? I did lousy at school.
Shuddup.
I'll knock 'em in, Charlie. I can do it. Blow his fuckin' head off. Get rid of the bastard for good.
Guess I'm just lucky.
I'm comin' for my twenty thousand.
That a Jew compliment?
Awww... deep down I'm a bastard, but when ya got eight kids ya can't make enemies.
Yeah...before your time.
Switch hands.
Most we've ever used is half a CC.
Julie, that stuff probably saved his life.
Sad commentary, huh?
<u>Why</u>??
Bend over?
I dress up when I want to make an impression. - So how'd it go?
Thank me next time you see me.
Can you give me a realistic idea...of how long this is going to last?
Honey, I have to clarify this. The thing is, Dr. Edelstein, my brother has an absolute <u>horror</u> of doctors - hospitals - needles - all of it -
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - <u>right now</u>. <i></i> I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm <u>okay</u>. Until I can get out of here...
But <u>why me</u>? Why'd you pick on <u>me</u>??
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
I'd better go report this...
Julie?... Hey, you <u>are</u> a looker.
Give me a date, Doctor.
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
What?
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Yeah, sure, no problem, you're welcome.
What about yesterday?  Kicking that poor boy?
Uh-huh?
Mother!
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Oh, I hope so, dear.
Oh.  Well, that would be a ... change.  Thank you, Mrs. Peterson.  You have a very reassuring voice.
Are you sure you got my bag in?
Moscow.
Oh, yeah ... yeah ... it's a hellhole.
Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?
Those busts up there--all around the wall--who are they, sonny?
Thanks very much, sonny--
It was done to stop me from talking about a section of the Appropriations Bill!
I did not--
Never.
I--I discussed it with him--yes-- because I--you see, I've always had this camp in mind--but I made no contract with him!
It couldn't be.
Yes, sir.  All right, boys--let's go.
Would you settle for a husband?
Who?
What do I play?
Frankly, kid--are you goofy?
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
And to Don Quixote!
Waiter!
Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?
I apologize.
Have *you*?
Well, let's get going.
Take me home, Diz.
Can't that wait, Hubert?
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
How do you feel, champ?
*You* tell Jim Taylor.
Jim--if I fling a party man like Horace in the face of those angry committees--
Joe--*you* know what I'm talking about. The perfect man. Never in politics in his life. Wouldn't find out what it's all about in two *years*, lets alone two months. But the important thing--and this was the genius of the stroke--*it means votes*!
Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I just--
The--head?
I said, sir--in my official capacity-- as an honorary gesture--I appoint you to the United States Senate!
Is *what* getting me down?
What stuff?
Well, it sort of got to be--from Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--
Look! There it is!
H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been looking for you--
For a question!
For one week!
I yield.
You don't have to tell me Jeff. We were a team, the two of us, a struggling editor and a struggling lawyer. The twin champions of lost causes, they used to call us.
No.
What's to stop you? Saunders will help you with it--
Here--where are you running off to?
Good as new! It's quite all right--
I wish to ask the gentleman--has he one shred of evidence to add now to the defense he did not give--and *could* not give at that same hearing?
I will not yield, sir! This same man-- Mister Taylor--came here to offer me a place in this Senate for twenty years, if I would vote for a dam that he knew and *I* knew was a *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth against it, he promised to break me in two! And I stood here one day and tried--I *started* to open my mouth-- and it all came to pass. The long, powerful arm of Mister James Taylor reached right into this sacred chamber and took me by the scruff of the neck--
Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, but--  --that plaster's gonna harden any second, son.
What is your interest in this, Mr. Taylor?
J-Jefferson Smith.
I wouldn't know in the *day time*.
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
With or without 'em.  Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a National Boys' Camp...
I know--but you--you're going to help.
Why?
We're over in the House.
Yes. Shall we start on it right now-- or order dinner first?
No complaints.
I don't see where we are *with* it.
Go right ahead.
No!
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
Second drawer.
Thanks a lot.
*Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't you--? Holy smoke;  H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How-- how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*-- *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, Miss Paine.  Did you hear that?--Escort Susan Paine--reception for a princess! Imagine her calling me--asking *me*-- !
Are you drunk?
That's funny. I thought all along--  Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted to talk to someone and--well--  --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--  Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in the Senate--haven't you heard?--I robbed boys of their pennies and dimes!
Wait--
Well--for a couple of years now--I-- I've thought it would be a wonderful thing to have a National Boys' Camp out in our State--
The truth! Well, the man wants the truth! "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, and turned away!
How are the pigeons?
Well! You don't say!
Mr. President--I stand guilty as *framed*! Because Section Forty is graft, and I was ready to say so. I was ready to tell you that one man in my state--Mister James Taylor-- was putting that dam through for his own profit!
Yes, *sir*.  Let's *go* Henry.
A pet idea--you know--pension bill-- save the buffalo--you've got *one* notion you think would be good for this country, haven't you?
Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith-- members of our State headquarters here.
Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a sack and drop her from the Brooklyn Bridge--
Shut up! You've *got* the man pilloried! Do you have to dance around him like a cannibal--!
Go away, Nosey.
Oh, now--that won't do--
I see. All right. You finish this job properly--and you get a handsome bonus besides--
Saunders--it's going to go pretty bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only one thing that can be done for him now--  I--I've written his resignation. He resigns under protest--denying all charges. No one will ever be sure if he was guilty or not. It leaves him with at least a shred of honor. The other way--branded openly in the Senate--expelled--he'll never live it down. Rather a simple compromise than utter ruin. In a year--the whole thing might be forgotten--
Jim, it's just that I like the kid-- I don't want to see you get too rough on him.
Just a minute, Joe!
It's crucifying him--!
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Jefferson dropped in for a minute, Susan.
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
Order!  Will Senator Smith yield to--?
Order!
Will Senator Smith yield to his colleague?
Page boys!
Who are you?
Morning, neighbors. Morning.
Deeds?
Sometimes he whistles.
Never can tell what he's going to do.
Yes, sir.
Yes!
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
What happened?
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
Yes.
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
He did?
A girl?
Oh, hello darling.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
We're not going out tonight.
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Yes.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Come on - let's go!
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh—
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
They are? I forgot all about them.  What do you think they want?
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
Better wire him right away, John.
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
See you later, kid.
What?
Yeah?
Yes.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Huh?
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
Nah.
Huh?
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people.  I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Only common sense.
Entertainment?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
They can have the Estate.
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business.
Well, thanks, I - uh—  How do you do? What is your name?
What kind of wife did you say she was?
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Why, you must drink! All poets drink!
Take the stand!
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I—
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
No.  Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Thank you, Your Honor.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
I write poetry.
Binge?
I don't know.
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch?
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Thank you so much. Good night.
What - tails?  Why, that's a monkey suit![5] Do you want people to laugh at me?  I never wore one of those things in my life.
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Every man to his taste, sir.
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Who?
What, sir?
How did they threaten you?
Take your time.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
Mr. Cook.
Uh-huh.
No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it.
Were you supposed to have a session?
A friend?
Dorothy Fowler. Fantastic woman. She passed last year in a train wreck. Damned Amtrak.
Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you?
Good, then go.
It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters.
What?!
What exactly is it supposed to do?
My name's Gilroy. I'm from the State Certification Board.
Nope.
I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, "I should have spent more time at the office."
A little.
I'm sorry, your honor.
No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry.
Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise.
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
Where am I supposed to eat?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Okay.
You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble.
You're good.
We're going for a walk.
Oh... not a real doctor.
There's something I think we need to talk about.
What do you mean?
No, I really don't.
-- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl.
Could I see Sofie, please?
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
People usually have to get to know me before they hate me.
Is she against you getting help?
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts?  So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it.  Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Disgusting.
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
I don't know if --
Of course.
You're upset.
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth--  Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
Okay...
Will you wait for me?
What do you mean, "in no time"?
It's a big part of the show.
It's my bit for the community.
You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa?
True. Should we stop them?
I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
You'd be surprised. Most guys have kids or wives or girlfriends. They're busy. It's not as easy as you think.
Well, you know... that's the thing. Like I said, just about everybody in town works for me. And it's just not the same asking someone to throw a ball when they work for you. It's like an order or something... And no one -- no one -- asks me.
Okay then.  Have you got a lot of friends?
Really? I'm the only person I know that likes Danny Ainge, outside of Celtic fans. Maybe Phoenix.
Yeah.  Guy's got some serious sex fantasies.
Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves.
Really?
Holy shit!
You were messed up, man.
Harder than I thought. Took me three tries. But I was highly motivated -- figured there was no point in leaving me and taking that along. After two bomb-outs, I found a place in the desert...
All new people start with that...
Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased.
English Lit.
Skip, you're a visionary. That can be a burden.
There are a lot of lonely people in the world. Somebody's gonna figure this out someday.
Oh, yeah, very tough. But I guess that's good... to keep out the quacks.
Wallace Franklin... from Greensburg.
Relax, I got him.
The ritual to bring the body of Anck- su-namun back to life.
By reading the Book Of The Dead.
None of the above, thank you.
Yeah, well, we all got our little problems today don't we?
It is better to be the right hand of the Devil,... than in his path. As long as I serve him, I am immune.
Intestines.
Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
-- then perhaps, the golden Book Of The Living can return them to the underworld.
No! She has seen too much. She knows too much.
Correct, And that's when --
For them to protect it like this, you just know there's got to be treasure down there.
Proceed!
Who cares? I don't see no treasure.
No... You came to ask me about Hamunaptra.
Want to know?
Yes, I'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. What do you think is out there?
Oh that's comforting.
We're about to be shown the way.
What are those mirrors for?
Preparation for what?
Who was talking about what?
How?
No you're not.
That bad huh?
The ten plagues?... You mean all ten plagues.
Forget it, we're out the door down the hall and gone.
We?! What we?! You didn't read that book. I told you not to play around with that thing.
Look lady, I appreciate you saving my life and all, but when I signed on, I agreed to take you out there and bring you back, and I did, now were even, end of job, end of story, contract terminated.
You can either tag along with me, or you can stay here and play around with Mister Maggot.
Jealous? You kiddin' me? Did you see that guy's face?
Got what?
I have no choice.
Yes?
He was the last Pharaoh of the Old Kingdom, said to be the wealthiest Pharaoh of them all.
After all, you rode us night and day to win that bet.
What's it look like!?
Be nice. That thing saved my life.
Yes, I'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?
Must of got a little too frisky with the Pharaoh's daughter.
And then he'll be coming after Evy.
He's a big fellow with pointy ears and a face like a falcon.
I know you did.
I know you knew I'd know.
Except for one little thing.
Head hunting.
Fantasizing... about you.
I'll be down in a jiffy.
I'm his daughter.
Really?
My father had this friend... He was an inventor...
Then Captain Amazing appeared.
And some sandwiches --
Well we can't call ourselves the Mystery People.
He was cute though.
I thought you'd never ask.
He's dead.
Think positive.
You know, Mr. F, me and the boys always loved workin' for you. You had such style: the clothes, the dancin', the elegant way you'd snuff a babe. You were the King...
Really?
It's home.
What have they got that we ain't got?
What are you talking about?
Good or evil, what's the difference?
My heart died a long time ago.
I say we send out the word -- and summon all of the unsung superheroes we know!
Because that's what it is.
But I just don't feel it.
There's a vague similarity.
So you're chicken?
Are you serious? This is the break we've been waiting for!
The Eradicators!
Hey... he's gone.
We prefer to think of ourselves as unsung... I am the Blue Raja, Master of Silverware... 
Burgers all around.  Medium.  Rare.  Raw.
Of course. I'm such a fool... Thanks, Mummy.
Jeffrey... this is wonderful.
Who are they?
This looks like a job for Superman --
Sorry.
Shut up.
I got this cousin. He's a real doofus, but he claims he can become invisible.
The who?
The bazookas?
Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
May the forks be with us!
Through there!
I have decided to accept the principle of a negotiation; the terms are not established.
You know, General Kutusov, there is a very strong possibility that the fire was not started by Napoleon's troops but was organized under the orders of Rostopchin's secret police.
For the sake of your argument, let us say that is correct.
Perhaps it would be even more serious than that, Your Majesty. His European confederation is held together by some very slender threads.  Your Majesty knows even better than I that Austria and Prussia are very doubtful allies, and the Emperor has reason enough to fear that they will turn on him, at the first sign of weakness.
If I can presume to go into the Emperor's mind, I believe that he has based his entire campaign strategy on obtaining a peace treaty after the fall of Moscow.  When Vienna fell, there was a peace treaty.  When Berlin fell, another treaty.  That has always been the rules of the game.  But what is he to do now if no treaty is forth- coming?  He knows that beyond Moscow, there is nothing, and that, if he withdraws, there remains only a fall into emptiness.
Yes, with all due respect, I do Citizen Barras.
Where are they?
Who sent my wife and son out of Paris?
What cowardice!  What treason! Joseph has ruined everything.  How could they all lose their heads. They knew I was coming up fast. Victory was just within grasp. Come, come, turn your troops around, General Belliard.
Let me see it.
Yes, sir, I had the honor of meeting them on the trip from Paris.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.  I will do that.
A glass of champagne, please.
I haven't been back for ten years. Is your family still there?
It is the work of incendiaries.
Our troops have no part in this.  It has been started by the Russians!
I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
I'm afraid he has been rather upset by the outcome of the battle.
Yes, I am, sir.
Are you staying with a friend, sir?
Is it a nice warm room, sir?
My dear Joseph, the only thing that is clear is that my wife is a slut -- and while a man may want a slut for his mistress, he does not want her for his wife.
No, I'm afraid I never had the pleasure of meeting the General. This sword was taken several days ago from your son by some of my soldiers.
Now, I know that I shall die if you leave me.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.  They were the easiest.  I made love to one of them within ten minutes of our first meeting.
All right -- I promise.
Open the door.  It's me.
What are you doing in there?
Five minutes.
Not be safe?  What on earth are you talking about?
I'm sorry, I thought he would give it to you.
He's downstairs -- somewhere.
What are you talking about?
I couldn't face telling you.
Yes.
I questioned the maid, and she admitted Charles had been Madame Bonaparte's lover for several months.
And was it so widely known that Joseph had reason for such concern?
Before you quote the rules of the road to me, Major, may I point out to you that you are not in France now, but that you are a guest in Russia.
Ah, you must forgive me, my dearest Marie-Louise, I saw it during one of my stays at your palace -- at Schonbrunn.
Of course, my dear.
You may have anything you wish, my sweet and lovely Marie-Louise.
I only desire what gives you pleasure, my dearest.
Yes, he has.
What you are talking about is a gamble on moderation -- when I gamble, I prefer to gamble on force.
He will stand by his agreement -- I know him better than you do.
You may save your philosophy for the magistrate, Monsieur Varlac.  I am only a simple officer in the army, and to me what you have done is called murder, and his always been called murder by honest men.
Monsieur Varlac, do not pretend to speak for these good people whom you have misled and inflamed with violent speech.  Now, I order you to come down from the cart.
From that moment on, I foresaw what I might be.  Already I felt the earth flee beneath me, as if I were being carried away up to the sky.
Duroc, I have a bill here for 600,000 francs from Tirot, for building the Imperial throne and six decorated arm-chairs.  The amount is absurd -- and, at least twice too much.
A year ago, the whole of Europe was marching alongside of us.  Today, the whole of Europe is marching against us.
You paid cash?
Good.
Passed out?  Can't hang, huh?  Boy, I knew you was a lightweight.  Passed out on one funky ass blunt.  They don't make 'em like they used to, baby.
Yup.
Ain't the rest room this way?  I gotta pee.
What happen?
You know what he mean, dude.
It's something in that hydraulic pump.
Well get along with this one.  Go ahead of us.  Don't get seen and don't let that mutt out of your sight.
If you say another word, it's over.  I'm not playing!
Joker, he just got out of the pen.  Li'l Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority.  And Baby Joker, he just got out of Juvenile Hall.
Naw, them dudes is assholes.  Especially that dog - Cheeco.  Watch this little ass, he's sneaky.  Plus, I got something better than a Cadillac.
I know, be still.
Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago and she's been harassing me ever since. She don't care about the restraining order or nothing.
I went back to Watts to sell my old car and met her on the way.  Worst day of my life.
Okay, plan B.
I don't.
Ain't no windows in here.
Still gonna smell it.
Out the door and to the left.
Sorry about today, man.
I don't know, and it could be anything. But I just say we go take a look.
Naw, you go first.
No.
I ain't scared of you.  We ain't little no more.
Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good together.  Where you going?
I don't know.
Why didn't she put'em out?
Okay.
Hold on.
I fell in some mud.  Now hurry up!
Well, then, it's all good.  Yo, Day-Day, something is going down with those Mexicans across the street?  I've been seeing a lot of activity.
Okay, sir...but where's the cover?
You damn right that's the big one.
You don't wanna know.
Negative...they vamped.
I know.
Ya'll live around here?
He's a boy, dude.
Thanks for the help.
Call me.
20 minutes?
I know.  I'm sorry.
What?!  This look like a 7-11 or something?  Get the fuck outta here!
Yeah.
I don't know the number.
Good, let's get out.
I don't know.
I don't know.  Suga, go ask Miss Ho Kym if she seen them.
Willie, shut up.  Yo' old ass need to get in a little bit o' trouble sometimes.
What's the matter?
Well, Craig, you're welcome anytime.
I threw my back, again.
It's an important speech.
What's he doing here?
What happened here?
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
That's...a comfort to hear.
That's right.
For not believing you.
Same to you.
You're from Santa Maria, Mr. Watson?
You wouldn't...
Good.
Where did you get these? Who are you?
The gun...
That's right. He's dead. Tell me why.
How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone?
No, please...
Don't you threaten me.
I'm sure. It's her husband. He's her Campaign Manager.
No way.
I can hear you good. Can you hear me?
What's that? You have to speak up.  I'm a little deaf in this ear. Between that and my wooden leg I'm a mess. Compliments of the United States Army Artillery Corps.
Keep it.
I remember. The big tipper.
Hey, a big tip doesn't give you the right to crap in my ear. You want change?  You got it, brother. What was that you gave me, a twenty?
What?
That's right.
It looks real. I don't know anything about guns.
Everybody does?
You're a big girl, huh?
A surprise?
Keep your eyes peeled.
Yeah.
What gives?
Yes, Dad.
I will guard Pearl with my life...
When'll Dad's skiff be ready?
Yep; gotta watch out for Pearl, Uncle Birdie.
Shoot, a horse-hair'll hold a lumpin' whale.
Yes! Yes! Hallelujah!
Ain't heard from Ralph since last Christmas. Don't matter -- I've got a new crop.  I'm a strong tree with branches for many birds. I'm good for something in this old world and I know it, too! We know that she will rout the Devil.
About what!
Sshhh! He's in there.
Mr. Powell!  Willa has run away!
A man of the Cloth?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
The boy worries me. It's silly, but it's like there was something still between him and his Dad.
Amen.
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Sshhh...
She's gone to Moundsville.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
We'll steal somethin' to eat.
That's Daddy!
Hurt her nothin'! Wash her's more like it!  Ruby!
About them Kings. That the Queen found down on the sandbar in the skiff that time.
He ain't my Dad.
I'll make coffee.
Is that all?
You ain't my Dad! You won't never be my Dad!
Nothin'!
Getting Pearl to bed. I --
NO, -- it ain't fair to make Pearl tell when she swore she wouldn't. I'll tell.
Don't you believe me?
You could save him, little bird.
What secret shall I tell?
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Where's the money hid? Tell me, you little wretch, or I'll tear your arm off!
Can I have this?
Our honeymoon.
Do? Why stay and take care of them little kids. Maybe it was never meant for a woman like Willa to taint their young lives.
He don't mean no impudence; do you, boy?  Do you, boy? Ah, many's the time poor Brother Ben told me about these youngins.
Harry, what --
Didn't you hear me, boy?
He must have wanted somethin', Ruby. A man don't waste time on a girl unless he gets something.
Mysteries. Incredible body hookus pokus. Truth is we still don't know what they are or where they come from. As for nightmares...  Did you know that in the last three years twenty Filipino refugees in California died in the middle of nightmares? Not from heart attacks, either. They just died.
R.E.M.'s. Rapid eye movements. The eyes follow the dream -- their movement picks up on this --
Get the kit!
Jesus.
Yeah. Something slippery all over here...  Tina?
Haven't slept, have you?
No.
They turn their back on it.  Takes away its energy, and it disappears.
I guess those people don't wake up to tell what happens.
Hi.
My dream.
Just like I did the hat. Have a hold of the sucker when you wake me up.
You're a jock. You must have a baseball bat or something. Come to my window at midnight. And meanwhile...
Hi daddy. I know what happened.
Nan, I --
I'll sleep in study hall, promise. I'd rather keep busy, you know?
I won't.
You're not falling asleep, are you? You could drown, you know.
Nancy?
But that's just not reality, Nancy!
Put that damned thing down!
They say you've bottomed out when you can't remember the night before.  No more drinking, Baby, suddenly I just don't feel like it any more.
He doesn't know you.  Couldn't you change?
Nobody's gonna kill you.
No more fights.
Have you any money?
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
You should be more careful, Anna.
Evening gown?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
And there?
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
Just for the honeymoon.
I don't want to go to Siberia.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
No, that's bad management.
You didn't get legal advice?
Yes, Comrade?
Don't worry... there will be enough.
I must be stern with you.
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
Good evening, Monsieur.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.
No, sir.
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Yes.
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Count d'Algout...
Thank you, Louis.
While you eat, you look at the view.
It's a real Paris reunion.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
I'll send you a muff.
No, no.
A cow?
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
Brave... that's right.
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Just looking around.
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
That's even better.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
Yes, Comrade.
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
I think so too.
You're going to force us... huh?
Why should I take a chance?
Me?
You're welcome.
You might hold this for me.
I don't have to but I find it natural.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
He takes good care of that.
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
I don't like your following me.
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Why?
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
No.
Yes.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
And General Savitzky.
A funny story?
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one.  The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
Darling, darling... please!
All right, we'll make it red.
No! No!
No! No!
Much happier.
No, no music.
Good morning, Swana.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her.  She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
You can't imagine.
Is this your new dress suit?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
Am I interrupting?
No thanks, Swana.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
Hello.
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
We have nothing to discuss.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
No.
Yes... leaving immediately.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Where is it?
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
They can't impeach me for bombing Cambodia.  The President can bomb anybody he wants.
He's nervous, sir.  He's heard you're looking for a new director.
Uh, I would say these people are going to cost a million dollars over the next two years ...
I mean, who the hell cares about this penny-ante shit.  Goldwater put it right.  He said: "Well for Christ's sake, everybody bugs everybody else; we know that." ... It's the cover-up, not the deed that's really bad here.  If only Mitchell could step up and take the brunt of it; give them the hors d'oeuvre and maybe they won't come back for the main course.  That's the tragedy of all this.  Mitchell's going to get it in the neck anyway. It's time he assumed some responsibility.
Nobody knows more about this thing than you do, John.
I'll bet he would.
In Richard Nixon's long history of underhanded dealings, he has never gotten better value for his money.  If I were to open my mouth, all the dominoes would fall.
I'm one of his people.  The Cubans are his people.  And we're going to jail for him.
It's the fall of the Roman Empire, are you blind?  And we're putting fig leaves on the statues ...
The "Old Man" plays politics harder than anybody else.
Jesus!  Did Mitchell know?
Mitchell?
Find out what the hell he was doing at "CREEP."  This could be trouble. These CIA guys don't miss a trick. This could be a set-up.
Well, sir ... it turns out -- one of the people implicated is still, you see, on our White House payroll.
I thought the gloves were off.
The hard-core four million "Nixon nuts" aren't gonna go for it ... They'll say I sold out to the Communists.
He got pretty burned at Chappaquiddick.
Can the president afford to ignore a subpoena?
Congress is considering four articles of impeachment, sir.
So?
There is nothing in that statement the President can't explain.
That's right ...
Howard Hunt is working for the White House?  No shit!  This is goddamn Disneyland!  Since when?
Our own intelligence capability -- to fix the leaks?
You approved that before the fact, because I went over it with you.  But ...
The Bay of Pigs? ... That was Kennedy's screw-up.  How does that threaten us?
Yes, sir, but ... do you think Gray'll go for it?
The only problem with that, sir -- it gets us into obstruction of justice.
How is this national security?
He wouldn't do the makeup.  Said it was for queers.
He's treading water.  Don't mention Khrushchev.
Chile, Congo, Guatemala, Cuba. Wherever's there's a need for an Executive Action capability, there's a Track 2.  In Cuba, Track 1 was the Bay of Pigs invasion.  Track 2 ... it was our idea.  We felt the invasion wouldn't work unless we got rid of Castro.  So we asked ourselves -- who else wants Castro dead?  The Mafia, the money people.   So we put together Track 2 ...
Before?!  Eisenhower approved that?
Jesus!
No ... a little deficit won't hurt. Jesus, they're serious.  Why're we stopping?
Please, Mother, it ... it was just one time, Mother, I'm ... I'm sorry.
What do you think?  He said in life there's no free ride.
I said I didn't need a free ride.  I need a suit.
Harold ... can I get you anything?
My friends call me "Mister President."
Then find something.  And I want these leaks stopped.  Jack fucking Anderson, the New York Times, the State Department -- I want to know who's talking to them.
Screw congressional oversight.  I know damn well, going back to the '50's, this agency reports what it wants, and buries what it doesn't want Congress to know.  Pay close attention to this.
I promised the American people peace with honor in Southeast Asia.  That could take time -- two, maybe three years ... In the meantime, your agency will continue at current levels of funding.
Yes.  And you will give General Cushman full access.
Is that why you and Kissinger are negotiating with the Chinese?
Black Irishman.  Very moving. "Turning and turning in the widening gyre / The falcon cannot hear the falconer / Things fall apart, the center cannot hold / Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world / And everywhere the ceremony of innocence is drowned / The best lack all conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity" ... But it ends so beautifully ominous -- "What rough beast, its hours come round at last / Slouches toward Bethlehem to be born?" ... Yes, this country stands at such a juncture.
If things remain as they are ... He's got the anti-war vote.
Yes.  Your old friend from Cuba.
Don't listen to 'em, don't quit. Remember - Kennedy, Bobby, and King were against the war.  Where are they now?  Don't give 'em a goddamn inch on the war.  President Johnson bombed Laos for years and nobody knew or said a thing.  How the hell the Times ever got ahold of this Ellsberg stuff is a disgrace!
No one.  Your property.  It would prove your case.  Why do you think Kissinger's taping your calls?  For history.  His word against yours -- and right now he's got the records.
A guy named Gordon Liddy.  Thinks he's Martin Borman.  You wanna meet him?
Just don't tell him to do anything you don't really want him to do.
I won't tell him if you won't.
"A warrior with nerves of steel is yet broken by a thread of silk." Nietzsche.
It's me or Wallace, Jack.  Wallace's third party is only going to help McGovern.  I need your support.
Jack, we're not living in the same country you and I knew in '46.  Our people are just not gonna sacrifice in major numbers for war.  We can't even get 'em to accept cuts in their gas tanks.  Hell, the Arabs and the Japanese are bleeding the shit out of our gold ..
I beg your pardon --
But it must be done; your government is paralyzed.
Not at all.  This is not going to leak, is it?
Yes, Mr. President.
I was the lesser of two evils.
Goes to show you all the moolah in the world can't buy you a brain.
You need her, Dick -- in '60 she was worth five, six million votes.
One of the fathers was on the TV saying, "My child was not a bum."  And it's playing like gangbusters.  Hell, Hoover told me one of the girls was a nymph.
You're shittin' me.
Ernie Davis.
Oh, I like satin, I like pink ...
Elvis I like, too.
Uh, is your mother ... still alive?
There's a lot more at stake here than what you want.  Or even what I want ...
And we got the "big mo"!  We're back!
What?  Win Vietnam, sir?
Tell 'em what you like; they'll never understand it anyway.
Gentlemen, I go now to discover the exact length, width and depth of the shaft.
Sir?
I know ...
What do you mean?  We worked for it. We earned it.  It's ours.
It's over, Dick.
I want a divorce.
Are you serious?
We ... haven't announced anything ... uh ...
Can I just ask for one thing?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
But they never will, Dick.  No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
When?
You.  What' you're doing --
You're drunk!
Lost.
To what?
The "crises"?
Whatcha predicting -- your boy Goldwater going to split the party?
Who else'd be in your truck.
What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it.
Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws.
I don't know. Nothin'. Wouldn't be no point to it.
Yes, you've circled round.
I don't know. I feel overmatched.
No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it.
No ID in her room?
It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing.
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
You sure?
You figure him for a dope runner?
I'm ahead of you there.
Natural to the line of work they was in.
My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I  don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know...
Three years ago I said them very words. No and Good.
Well I didn't see it.
No. I found it.
You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean.
Yeah.
Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
I'm gonna borrow a car. From Eldon.
Don't wanna register it. I'll call you in a couple days.
Yes I do.
Well I got  a good one. So they ought to even out. Quit worrying about everthing.
Uh-huh.
You should be used to that.
Hey.
What makes you say that?
You mean the nature of this conversation?
Where does he work?
Where does he work?
I need you to step out of the car, sir.
Not a bleep.
Well -- where ya goin'?
You know who it is.
Yeah? Where am I?
Yeah. I know where you're going.
No. Do you?
I seen you was from Dallas.
I didn't mean nothin' by it.
I don't know. Will there?
With what?
Is that what you're asking me? Is there something wrong with anything?
Sir?
Sir?
For what?
I didn't put nothin' up.
Uh-huh. Double ought.
The kind with the most poles.
No sir, it's unusual.
What room?
You seem pretty sure of the date. Did I ask you to sit?
Yessir. I understand that.
Yes?
Another additional.
Oh. That's who you keep lookin' out the window for?
What else then?
Yeah but no one ever sees that. I like a man that'll tell you he's married.
I know what it is. He won't find me again.
I'm a welder.
Yes.
He isn't. You're not cut out for this. You're just a guy that happened to find those vehicles.
No I don't have it.
If I was cuttin' deals, why wouldn't I go deal with this guy Chigurh?
He don't talk as much as you, I give him points for that.
No sir. I'm a veteran.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
They're fine... you miss it?
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
...to see you.
"Thirty-two?"
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I better go check on them.
...what're you saying?
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
Umm... yes. Back home.
Maroon.  I stole it.
Yeah, me too.
Do what?
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
You knew Del?!
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
I ran back in to get the phone.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Roy! What are you doing here?
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
I begged him to let me put that on!
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Los Angeles, California.
Did you love it?
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
What's his real name?
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Fine.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
No, you're not. You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision. Now, if you'll excuse me...
Andersonville.  They did horrible things to men there...
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
If we're for real?
I don't follow...
...and put them in your mouth.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
IT SURE IS!!
He told us it's in the Buick.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size...  He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
It just didn't fit her profile...
...who doesn't?
You better believe it.
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
We know that...
No! Let me try this!
Uh-huh.
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small...  I should have never come back here after college.
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
No doubt, brother - I figured as much back there in the restaurant. That's why I invited you out here for this advanced tutorial.
Waitaminute -
You have eluded fate - and eluded me - for the last time. Tie their hands, boys.
You mis'able little sneak thief...
Yeah, it stinks in that ol' barn.
Do not seek the treasure!
Don't know, Delmar-though the blind are reputed to possess sensitivities compensatin' for their lack of sight, even to the point of developing para- normal psychic powers. Now clearly, seein' the future would fall neatly into that ka-taggery. It's not so surprising, then, if an organism deprived of earthly vision-
I thought you said you were innocent a those charges.
Where's Tommy?
Oh sweet Lord, Everett, looka this!
Caintcha see it Everett! Them sigh- reens did this to Pete! They loved him up an' turned him into a horney- toad!
Okay, Everett.
Everett, my beard itches.
Aw, don't be ignorant, Delmar. I told you they was gonna flood this valley.
Oh, yes, assa parful new force.
Wipin' little circles with his bread...
Cain't beat 'em, join 'em.
Oh gracious no. Not with his blandishments.
Now Penny, stop that!
I'll tell you what I am - I'm the paterfamilias! You can't marry him!
Don't I know it.
Well that hardly sounds like you...
...I believe, unless I'm very much mistaken - see, we've been away for several years, uh...
But... but...
Eighty-four years old! I'll be gummin' pab-you-lum!
Watch your language, young fellow, this is a public market. Now, if you want Dapper Dan I can order it for you, have it in a couple of weeks.
Well, I don't record Negro songs. I'm lookin' for some ol'-timey material.  Why, people just can't get enough of it since we started broadcastin' the 'Pappy O'Daniel Flour Hour', so thanks for stoppin' by, but-
Boys, that was some mighty fine pickin' and singin'. You just sign these papers and I'll give you ten dollars apiece.
How can I lay hold a the Soggy Bottom Boys?
We cain't do that, Daddy, we might offend our constichency.
Blooey!
Great.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Nobody. It just came to me.
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
I never said any of that!
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.  Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!  No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
No, sir!
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
It's important, sir!
How're you doing, Sarge?
Pardon?
Zack, don't!
But you knew right off what I was talking about, didn't you, Paula! Did you let that boy --
Then you're dumber than I thought! All you'll get from their kind is pregnant!
Yeah.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
Let's just wait and see what happens.
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Come on. Let's go dance.
Great.
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
He didn't give you much choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I've never had a girl.
When I'm good and ready.
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Twenty-two years ago.
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises.  Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why?
I can't risk it.
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
He said he grew up poor?
Foley's not poor. Buddy of mine in oh-four told me he's the son of a rich doctor down in Louisiana.
Yeah.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from.  Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
It's mine.
I don't want Raoul to administrate that part.
Who else but God could think this shit up?  I spend ten years building those fucking rooms to keep people out, now I gotta figure out how to get in.  God, man, He just loves the irony.
Just sending a message.  She'll get the point.
Okay, okay!  Okay.
FUCK YOU, I'M GONE!
I know.
You're an idiot.
I met him at the tables, same as you.  And frankly, I'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.
Yeah.  Kidnapping.
Shut up and let me think.
Shit!
Adios.
Everything okay?
Stop asking me that.  I'm fine.  Who called you?
No ball, kid.
It's okay, Raoul.
No fucking way.
If you think I'm gonna let my half of the fourteen million bucks slip away because of --
The hell we are.
Nobody leaves.
Why?
I don't think so, but I love her album.
Open the door.
Well, I know that now.
The crowd goes wild.
Feel okay?
Shhh...
On it!
He won't even know who it was.
I'm sorry.
I'm dizzy, not deaf.
What if I keep dropping?
What do you mean? We're black ain't we? And we care about improving the plight of out people don't we? Or you figure oppression stops at that thing dangling between your legs!
But nothing, we want full fledged membership in the Black Panther Party... and none of this "Okay sugah as long as you stay in the background washing my socks and rubbing my feet" bullshit either!
And they sure ain't from the neighborhood. Figure Sabu's in there?
Fuck that, we've got company...
You gotta. You gotta stay alive. You know what they were trying to do here. You got the pigs dead to rights. It's like Huey said, you're more important than any of us.
Well as the Rev says, God helps those who help themselves.  We'll be our own stoplight.
What it be is, You aren't coming with us.
That's just it Huey. The pigs don't know how many Panthers there are. Both of us show and they might start putting 2 and 2 together. We're not even two hundred strong yet... but we got 'em guessing thousands.
You know it brother.
Man, El-Rage is El-Rage. You know him.
What's with you?
Do you know how easy it would be for you to just disappear. Shit, you wouldn't even wash up for weeks. Do you fucking understand?  I want you to move your ass outta neutral. I want a bunch of Panthers served up on a fucking plate. I want you to set 'em up... armed robbery!!
Yeah, it's me.
I don't know. Look around man.
Yeah, and I'm gonna start by getting on my feet. Working on things from inside the system.
It's a bit more like how can we help you. Bay Area's become quite a hornet's nest in terms of subversive activities. And... well Mr. Hoover wants to reiterate that the FBI will be happy to assist local authorities in any way we can. On a strictly advisory basis... of course.
Chief Dorsett, if the Black Panthers are going to remain in your jurisdiction, some fundamental changes in attitude need to be made...
Are you finished?
Jesus...
...no full fledge alliance. But I think we should do a rally with them. Show that there's some common ground between Black and White. You all with that?  All right then Eldridge, set it up.
Yeah... but it seems they're bringing Malcolm's widow Betty Shabazz to town, to speak at a rally, do an interview for Ramparts.  And they want us to help with security.
No! Just harassment. Can't let it stop this.  Brother we got momentum!
You know I think Brother Judge needs our support right now, not our suspicion  This is beautiful man. Folks around here never read the truth like this before.
I'm down.
Yeah I know. You're smart Judge. You ain't no bourgeois nigger like those Paper Panthers across the bay. I need every good man to help us with the security on Betty Shabazz, particularly soldiers. You do solid on that I might have something else for you, something real important.
They were empty...
Brimmer.
Yeah.
You got that right. And brother, I got a feeling it's going to get a whole lot thicker.
If the pigs only knew they were subsidizing The Panthers...
Me too. That's why I fight so hard.
What you see is what you got.  That's' Bobby Seale.
Just the legit shit.
Yeah, "brother" My best friend is stone dead.
Mothafucker! You just set Bobby Seale up to be kidnapped. They dragged him off to some bullshit conspiracy trial in Chicago. How much the pigs pay you for this one, Judge? 
Bullshit...
No man No!! Tyrone listen... we got to move man, they got a warehouse...
All of the above, man...  And then some.
Funny you don't look like church folk to me.
What?
Judge man. Watch yourself. Sabu's got juice now.
I saw. I saw that big one  hit that police man. Saw 'em drag you off too.  They take you to jail?
Mom, black folks been praying to God for four hundred years. Maybe it's time we tried something else...
I don't know. I really don't.
Thank you.
That would be nice, too.
I expect to try.
I've just been inside the mind of a genius.  Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
No, he takes after his mother...
He's my father.
Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
Oh, right.  Baking powder, we need baking powder.
Our governor is a bigger fool than I thought.
Very well, then.
Goodbye.
Apology accepted.
Please accept my apology for not having done so sooner.
Prisoner exchange.
If that's your position, then eighteen of your officers will die. Nineteen, if you hang me with my men.
Sir.
The British army is barricaded in Boston.  Harry Lee, is here from Virginia, recruiting for a Continental Army.
When you have children, I hope you'll understand.
It's already over.
You know how old I am.
Go on.
Please.
Thank you.  Were I an orator, those are the exact words I would have spoken.
Harry, Harry, Harry...
When?
So you're going to try to keep Cornwallis in the South until then.
You expect Cornwallis to be held here by militia?
How many men does Cornwallis have under his command?
Goodbye, Harry.
Four, five miles.
I heard about your son.  I'm sorry.
For richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health, 'til death do they part.
He looks as if he's sleeping, doesn't he?
But it's already been two years and that's two more years.  The war could be over by then.
Six-pounders.  Lots of them.
Quiet.
Well...I guess not.
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
Anyone who can scream that loud isn't ready for intensive care just yet-- looks like she just skinned her knee.
Yayyy!
To remember.
That's enough, Ellen.
Well, I think Michael McDowell is so full of shit he probably squeaks when he walks, my dear.
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Do you believe that?
You believe in it.
Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance.
Ayuh, I think 'twas. If I see Louis come home before I go to bed, I'll tell him to--
That road--and those Orinco trucks-- are the two main reasons it's there.
Nope. The Micmac Indians. What's up ahead is all that's left of their tribal lands.
I'm sorry. At least it don't look like he suffered.
You going to bury him in the Pet Sematary?
Maybe when they call I'll just tell Ellie I haven't seen the damn cat around. You know?
Does she love the cat?
The place we're going is on the other side of that.
No. We won't. I have climbed it a time or two before, and I know all the places to step. Just follow me...move easy...don't look down...and don't stop. If you stop, you'll crash through for sure.
No, I'm okay. Will I really be able to dig him a grave? The soil looks thin.
Don't worry about that.
No buts! Accept what's done, Louis. What we done was right. Another time it might not be, but tonight it was... at least I hope to Christ it was. Now you make your call...but not a word about tonight.
What did we do, Jud?
Stanny B. did for me what I did for you last night, Louis. Only I wasn't alone when Spot came back.
Why...that sometimes dead is better. That's all. Sometimes dead is better.
The power of this place is old and always restless. Sometimes the dead do more than speak. Remember, doc.
Timmy Baterman. That was wrong.
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Jesus, the road!
Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed.
Did you see his shirt?
Jesus, Rachel, what's got into you?
I thought maybe you did. I know you don't approve of the subject being raised--
You're doing fine.
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
Aye, aye, sir!
Say the name, or I slit your throat.
Wait as long as you like.
Bosun!  Set up Mr. Sparrow's quarters, nice and fine ... in the brig.  Meaning no disrespect, of course.
All right then.
I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end well for you.
By the powers, you're right!  Where's Jack's pistol?  Who's got it?  Bring it forward!
Very well.
Elizabeth --  Turner.  I'm a maid in the governor's household. 
Of course.  I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
Will -- you can't trust him.
Think again, Miss Swann. Vile and dissolute creatures, the lot of them. I intend to see to it that any man who sails under a pirate flag, or wears a pirate brand, gets what he deserves: a short drop and a sudden stop.
Boy overboard!
He can locate Isla de Muerta -- but I doubt he'll be willing to help us from the brig.
I am to understand that you will accept my marriage proposal on the condition I rescue Mr. Turner?
And that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, we will be landing in Port Royal soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station?
Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts?
Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'?
To keep it away from them?  No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock.
-- but that was not a proper kiss.
I saved your life; now you've saved mine.  We're square.
The trees are taller.
Don't be thinking I'm not already working on it.
Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to.  All I need is a crew.
Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight.
Wait for my order -- what the blazes is that?
You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men.  You'll never make it out of the bay.
As likely as not.  Will, short up the anchor, we've got ourselves a ship!
Sorry, I didn't know.
Smith.
No.  I can not just step aside and let you escape.
Surely you've heard the stories? The Black Pearl sails from the dreaded Isla de Mureta ... an island that cannot be found -- except by those who already know where it is.
Why ask me?
My business, Will.  As for your business -- one question, or there's no use going.  This girl -- what does she mean to you?  How far are you willing to go to save her?
Aye!  Avast!
I worked passage from England as a cabin boy.  After my mother passed, I came out here ... looking for my father.
You didn't beat me.  You ignored the rule of engagement.  In a fair fight, I'd kill you.
Barbossa.
Depends.
-- and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves.
The Black Pearl is a real ship.
If he were telling truth he wouldn't have told us.
Mentioned it, is more what he did.
No.  She hasn't.
You got it, Dr. Argon.
Have you found Dr. Bright?
You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature's going to bury you like she buries everyone else.
The only history I'm gonna write is your obituary!
It's ready now, I know it is.
Now, Icky, I don't need you winding yourself up.  I need you focused and in control.
In the meantime, we're going to need someone to deal with that mess in the lab.  I don't think we should call Dr. Bright.
Nebbleman.
Yes.  Yes, of course it is.
Poppy, please, just tell me what you want.
Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.
Excellent.  How long until the assembler tank is complete?
I want Trix!  Mommy!
Why don't you just put this in your pocket so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.
What did he want?
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't.  The situation is critical right now.  The replicators are growing exponentially.  If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an opportunity here.
No!  Well, not those exact words.
Wellie well, Dr. Bright.  You're just in time.
You know, this and that.
Same old Daniel.
Yes.
Got it.
The waste.
That's right.
No, why?
No, no, I just feel wired!
Blame the victim.
No problem.
I think it would be better for me to go alone.  I'm sure Sim is looking for you.  Just sit tight.  I'll bring you back a pizza.
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
Getting used to it.
Like a glove.
Sort of.  We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
Let's go.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
It's too late.  Argon injected it.
I guess they do.
Oh yes you are!
And you have him?
Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?
Just one question.  Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
Don't worry, four eyes.
'Paranoia is what separates the secured from the unsecured.'
Yes, he might be.
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
No - give you another guess.
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters.  That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me.  Here.
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve.  The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
Of course I am Stewart.
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters—
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
What are you talking about?
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
Your house?
You can't walk out of here like this.
Stop it. Anne. You're behaving like the person you're married to.
Mother!
Who is it you wish to see, sir?
Thanks, I will.
Huh?
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
Hey, make up your mind, will you?
Oh boy, I'd love it.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Well - it's only April.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
My play.
Your valet, sir.
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
Yes, of course. Miss Ramsey telephoned me. Well, what would you like to have?
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
I hope you'll be very happy.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy.  A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me.  Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler?  I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky!  Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour[18] some place.
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Very good.
Sorry, boss—
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
She did—?
Double strength!
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you.  This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
Yes, sir.
I just putter.
Oh no, sir. I putter with me hands.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Thanks.
Yeah ...  That--and ...
Yes.
What?
It can't be possible.
Looks just like it did.
Hello Bill.
I think it looks nice.
Bud brought it to me.
She's crying.
Yes she is.
No ...
Yeah.  Or like sprinklers in the summer ...
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
Oh, gosh no.
I think ... I might be ill ...
It is?
Yeah ... How'd you know?
Oh, no thanks ...
I'm fine--but thank you.
One of those ... big beds?
Oh my Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
Well, I ... I came home like I always do, And I came in the front door. And I took off my coat. And I put down my briefcase and I said "Honey. I'm home."
Still doesn't make it right.
Um ... Yes I do. Where's our lawyer?
Very well ...
Well, I never had to do it before.
Oh. guess I could do that, then.
Oh yeah. A Buick. It's swell.
The other one?
Get lost!
You--you gotta get us out of here.
We just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. Then I'll talk to him and ...
What were you doing in a library?
Just go with the program--hunh? I'm late for work.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set.  You like all this don't you?
They don't have that kind of potential.
I told you. I'm like positive.
Oh, no ... You baked those for Whitey.
No. You baked them for Whitey.
Oh ... Right.
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
You don't know?
Well it's louder ... And scarier I guess ... And ... and a lot more dangerous ...
Yeah.
We'll just put up the top.
It was a prop for the school play ...
No I won't. I swear.
Easy. Mr. Jenkins. What JOB did Mr. Jenkins have?
Marathon starts at 6:30. Contest's tomorrow at noon.
Of course it is Howard. That's why they call it a Marathon.
What department store did they go to?
That's right.
What the hell's going on!
Because we don't belong!
No you're not.
I'm sorry ... I can't let you do that.
They weren't my memories.  I borrowed them. It's no good when you borrow them.
I'm so glad you're here.
Listen to me!
Yeah ...
Oh--what's the point, Bud?
TV repair?
What's the rush?
What happened?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
You know--this is a pretty strange way of showing your appreciation.
You just fucking said "chat," that is so -- what are you now? "chat." I'm just calling to make sure you show up at this party tonight.
Fine. You get back to chatting with your precious customers.
Ok. Thank you.
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I don't know.
I'm gonna call you back.
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
This is Georgia.
I'm just laying on my bed.
Are you watching a porno movie?
You have a girlfriend?
...yeah.....
Georgia.
Uhhh...I am sooo tired...I stayed up too late last night, what about you, when did you go to sleep?
Yeah.
Really? Please?
See the thing is I could make it really easy on you -- I already have your credit card number, your information, address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I'm sorry --
Not very well.
Hi.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
Really?
-- well, if you're gonna go --
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
Yeah.
It's Barry.
Yeah?
Yes? I'm trying.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Yes.
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
For what?
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
It's ok to ask that.
If they break or something. What is it, plastic?
I'm fine, I have your work number.
Ok, bye, bye.
Just have you for one second, please.
You're hand is bleeding.
Why? ...what?
Please don't do this to me.
Sorry.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05/04.
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
What?
That's that.
Well I'm sorry. Before...
I'm sorry.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
WHICH?
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
Where you goin?
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
What do you have in the house?
Is this where you live?
This is a bunch of bullshit.
What time are you gonna be there?
You can't be late though.
Don't puss out.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
Hey, it's me. This guy from L.A., Barry Egan is calling on the other line and saying all this stuff, he wants to talk to a supervisor or whatever --
Nothing.
Are you sure?
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Ok.
"One day, Fanchon was visited by a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting follicles..."
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
Why not?
You'll hate me now, won't you?
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
I don't take my orders from you; not anymore.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
Valcour. His chair.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I know, because I felt it myself --
Why was it you never took her by force?
Then it must've been love --
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
He's sworn to obedience.
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
That's not our intent --
What could cause a tincture like this?
A word of caution, Sire: we all remember what happened to Robespierre, Danton and Marat. Put the Marquis to death, and history might even regard you as a despot.
I'm afraid so; he's an idealist. You'll have to be politic.
Monsieur Masse says he'd like another manuscript, quick as you please. He's got himself three presses, and he can't print 'em fast enough.
I tremble with fear! You're bound to pound the quivering lips of my Venus mound!
Yes?
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
Don't start --
There's something else I want from you.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
I pray you: be succinct.
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
And I in yours.
Of course.
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
Not you too
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
Houdini mice.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
I can't
And he did.
One . . . buys things.
There's nothing to explain
No, you don't. You want to condemn me, like everyone else. You want to point to the pathetic, old man grown lunatic with his spending -- trapped in his ridiculous
"You don't care about anything except you. You just want to persuade people that you
"A toast then, Jedediah, to love on my own terms. Those are the only terms anybody ever knows, his own."
Huh?
We're using-
Like a bug.
Sure. Dropped her out of his Lockheed over Utah
No, baby, those are the hands of a killer
The whole joint is half the size of Rhode Island.
Image the possibilities as this man controls the public perception of the nation through his--
We're doing Hearst.
Don't do this
Then let him. What have we got to lose, you and I?
Short enough. But this is a grand start And I think we need to change the name.
K-A-N-E. One strong syllable. Kane I
Uh huh.
Fuck you.  You wanted me out. I'm out.
"And how is the country to feel when this industry continues to employ bedraggled foreigners and swarthy refugees instead of real Americans? Doesn't Hollywood know there's a Depression on? Don't real Americans deserve work?"
Christ.
Yeah, you're probably right.
And we gotta be clear here. I need the negative and every existing print.
No, maybe put it on the shelf until the old man kicks it.
CITIZEN KANE
CITIZEN KANE There's your title.
Now look, Orson, let's not get ahead of ourselves. The budget projections on this--
Please don't ask me to do this.
I don't want to sit
It was fun, wasn't it?
Spare me the aria, I know what you want--
Yes!
Yes! Vibrant and modern and stark like a Picasso sketch drawn to flashes of lightning I We shoot the whole thing in the gallant American West--
Aw, Tommy, c'mon, it ain't that.
Tommy, Jake respects you. He won't even say hello to anybody else -- you know that. But you know when Jake gets set on somethin', Jesus Christ Almighty could get off the fuckin' cross and he ain't gonna talk him out of it. I'm his kid brother. I got no say with Jake on this. He thinks he can buck everybody and make it on his own.
I'd like to talk to Jake a minute.
What?
You were great, Jake. Just like old times. Good thing Sugar Ray wasn't here tonight. Oh Jake, this is State's Attorney Bronson and his wife.
Yeah. Do me a favor.
Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
What does that have to do with it? She don't look 15 to me. I heard somethin' with Salvy. She was with him once or somethin', I think. It was like some blonde. That's the one...
Yeah, she's nice.
You wasn't with her, were you?
No, take her home. I wanna be alone for a while. Everybody go.
You want the title shot or not?
This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and- coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
I remember the first time I met Vickie... I know there's somethin' up. I know she's doin' somethin', but I can't catch her...
What do you mean?
What the fuck they want? I took the dive. They want me to fall down too? I don't fall down for nobody. I never went down in my life. Joey, what do I gotta do? Crawl on my hands and knees? I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.
Yeah, except fall down. That's right.
What am I gonna do for 24 hours? I can't even eat!
I can't tell. You're stomach's in the way.
Nothin'. Salvy was out of line. He was drunk or somethin', I dunno. Anyway, the windup was I gave him a beatin'. Tommy called me down, and we straightened it out. It's all forgotten about.
No, I just told you what happened.
You're supposed to keep an eye on her for me. I'm askin'...
So, go ahead. Kill everybody. Kill Salvy, kill Vickie, kill Tommy Como, kill me while you're at it. What do I care? You're killing yourself the way you're eating, the way you worry about things you don't have to worry about.
Whatsa matter with you?
Does that mean...
Don't talk. Keep at it. Jab, jab, jab. You're ahead on points.
You don't get nothin' done by watchin'. You just gotta do it. Here, I'll help you.
Can you see it?
No.
Come over here.
Come here.
I'm not interested in him.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
All I did...
Yeah --
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
Are you drunk?
What friends?
Never felt better.
Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
All right, I'll try. See you later.
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Jefferies?
But his leg!
Namely?
When the lock is broken -- yes.
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
I'll bet it's been done.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
I was jaywalking.
What time?
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
Mrs. Thorwald.
You think he's getting out of here?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
You figured that out, huh?
That depends on who "they" were.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
Where'd they take Lisa?
For getting rid of that cast.
I didn't ask you to stand in the middle of that automobile race track.
Well -- you know best. Call you later, Jeff.
Why should I?
How?
It crashed, didn't it?
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
I don't want to.
She's all right.
Stella!
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
How did you know!
Depends one which one.
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
There's probably one in the basement.
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances.  Give me the phone book, Lisa.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
Jeff again.  Has Tom come in yet?
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
For what?
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
I have one now.
Tell me about it.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
Someone not his wife?
I don't know.
Thinking about Thorwald?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
How?
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
Give me some dirt.
Somebody find him a knife.
Stay there.
Hi.
Okay.
Buzz?  What are we doing this for?
No--
Hang loose.  We got all night.
Hold it, Jim.
Not just buy!  You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough.  We give you love and affection, don't we?
Well, now--
You know I never stop you from anything.  Believe me--you're at a wonderful age.  In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Will you wait a minute?
Sorry.
Have some cigars.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
Stay here.  That was my son!
Yes, sir.
What's the charge?
My parents know I'm out.  They know I'm here.
Hi there.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it.  Go- go-go!
I hitched.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
How'd you find me?  What's happening?
Shut up.  Are you nuts?
Wow!  Well now-there-then!
When was that?
Plato!
I'm here.
I'm fine.
I just have a feeling.  Where are you?
We didn't run out.  We were coming right back.
Friends never break promises, do they?  Okay.  Here.  Now listen.  There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe.  You understand that?  They said I could come in and bring you out.
Ray!  Will you tell these guys to move back?
Keep away from me!  I don't believe you anymore!
Stop tearing me apart!  You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
Grandma?
No.
Leave me alone.
Mess that kid up?
"If he could" what?  You mean your father?
Chicken?
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Now that's true!
"Life is crushing in on me."
Where what was.
Won't mother be proud.
Dig the square wardrobe!
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
A what?
They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself?
No.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
I don't know.
You don't need to do that.
Sure.  He was trying to make us his family.
Yes.  My best friend.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing.  I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof.  His name's Jim.  It's really James but he likes Jim more.  People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
He's dead.  He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
He hates me.
He hates me.
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
I'll never get close to anybody.
My mother?
We used to sing it in school.  Don't look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.
We were romantic then too--
With us old creeps?  Come on, we have to eat.
Hi.
What?
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
To all those cons...
Ashley, no. That was me, that's what I was scared of. I mean, be serious... I ain't exactly looking like Mr. Universe here.
I can get another one going. Y'know, hey, whatever you want me to --
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
We could live it up and --
Nick, I love you --
He didn't "find" Nick's letters, did he.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
Jack. Jack Bangs.
But you knew why. Knew why, didn't ya.
So get him outta your life. Get out of Michigan. They got perfume counters in Chicago, don't they?
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Nick, the ice is --
You saved me.
Ash. Don't say it. Don't say my name.
What?
I'm almost done.
We need a gun, Ash. We need a gun...
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
Yeah. That's love.
We still gonna spend Christmas together?
You shouldn't have.
Rudy. How'd you know my name?
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
You got the wrong guy! She thinks I'm Nick, I'm not!
I was in the joint with him! I knew about him and her, okay!? I took his place!
I never worked at no casino.
Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here.  Get him back in the rig.
J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances.
At least gimme video poker.
You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral.
Don't tip.
Nothing... I promise-nothing...
What, we walking in there and delivering toys?
Leave the tree.
I don't know... what you're...
What... Powwow...
GO!!!
We understand you, Mr. Bangs.
His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
Hi, Nick.
He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me.
I promise you, I didn't know!
Fuckin, Zookerman --
I'm just saying.
Thought you hate your old man.
What, working security?
Good for you. Protein.
Two days, we got two days! Don't do nothing. Don't touch nothing --
Standing right here, man!
Alamo...
Walk outta there and tell her I was you.
Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember
But... I had a five...
Thanks, don't mind if I do.
Fine, now.
You ain't dying, he is.
Who?
Was he all pissed off?
It makes perfect fuckin' sense to me. Eddie, you didn't see how he acted during the job, we did.
How do you know all this?
What?
Really? Who's your P.O.?
Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
Nobody saw what happened to Mr. Blue?
I got a bag. I stashed it till I could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
What the fuck was that chick's name? Oh this is just great, I'm totally fuckin' tortured now.
Let me say this out loud, just to get it straight in my mind. According to you, Mr. Blonde was gonna kill you. Then when we came back, kill us, grab the diamonds, and scram. That's your story? I'm correct about that, right?
This better not be some Freddy joke.
...What bar?
You ever seen this motherfucker before?
How can you tell?
Did the two of you talk?
Where I was from, who I knew, how I knew Nice Guy, had I done time, shit like that.
It's a scene. Memorize it.
A undercover cop has got to be Marlon Brando. To do this job you got to be a great actor. You got to be naturalistic. You got to be naturalistic as hell. If you ain't a great actor you're a bad actor, and bad acting is bullshit in this job.
Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
What for?
Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
What? Snap out of it!
A guy named Scagnetti. Seymour Scagnetti.
What do you care?
She hooked up with Fed McGar, they've done a couple a jobs together. Good little thief. So, explain the telegram.
Freddy Newendyke.
Shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
What was that? I'm sorry, I didn't catch it. Would you repeat it?
It's a surprise.
You didn't ask.
You see what I been puttin' up with? As soon as I walk through the door I'm hit with this shit. I tell 'm what you told me about us stayin' put and Mr. White whips out his gun, sticks it in my face, and starts screaming "You motherfucker, I'm gonna blow you away, blah, blah, blah."
I can' take you to a hospital.
Lie back down, and try to -
Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off. Whoever set us up, knows about this place. There could've been cops sitting here waiting for me. For all we know, there's cops, driving fast, on their way here now.
The cops didn't show up after the alarm went off. They didn't show till after Mr. Blonde started shooting everyone.
Uh-uh, just cops.
That's the way I look at it. A choice between doin' ten years, and takin' out some stupid motherfucker, ain't no choice at all. But I ain't no madman either. What the fuck was Joe thinkin'? You can't work with a guy like that. That motherfucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger-happy?
You don't think it's possible, one of them got a hold of the diamonds and pulled a -
That was the plan, we meet here.
Thank god, we discovered in time. We hadda forget the whole fuckin' thing. Just walked away from it.
That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet that I saw him take. So don't be calling him a rat.
Go down the hall, turn left, up those stairs, then turn right.
You gotta idea, spit it out.
Oh, I don't doubt is was quite beautiful -
Oh that's really easy for you to say, you're Mr. White. You gotta cool-sounding name. So tell me, Mr. White, if you think "Mr. Pink" is no big deal, you wanna trade?
Graham's got something to tell you might interest you.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
As far as -- Sonora?
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
In the grub box.  Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
The who?
Will she be dark or fair?
Maybe it's better that way.
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
Why?
Which ranch?
Like what?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
That's right, Steve.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
You better start.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
The whole state's lookin' for 'em.  And they're lookin' for me.
Nobody asked you to.
I don't care.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
I like it.
Then why stay in the hills.
Well, say it.
Depends on how good you drive.
They shouldn't have done that.
I don't like to see you go.
Maybe in Sonora.
That'd be swell.  You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
That's the end of the line.
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Would they be good to eat?
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Steve --
I think he wants me.
Oh, this is too much. I'm gonna have to play these numbers. Remind me to pick up a Lotto ticket.
Okay... maybe that would be best.
Hey, Cindy. Your friend needs help.
Brenda, are you okay? Come sit.
Hello Ray.
I don't know. He was right behind us. Wait here. I'll be right back.
Thanks. I'm Cindy.
Yeah.
Wow, she's beautiful. You really think she looks like me?
Alright!
Hugh Kane.
Oh, Buddy, that's so romantic.
I don't care. You pick.
It's okay.
Listen, no need for you to worry. All that stuff that happened before is behind us. Let's just try to move on.
This is Ray. What's up? Where are you?
Yes, Professor Oldman's group. Forgive me. I didn't mean to frighten you.
Thanks. I made them by hand.
I don't need your help.
We? What do you mean... we?
My child you are the only survivor.
Father, I don't understand. Tell me what happened?
I told you it would taste just like chicken.
Why don't you shut up, Professor? Just relax.
And what happens when all hell breaks loose?
In about fifteen minutes.
Fine.  What's all this stuff?
That one.
Congratulations, Dwight, it's begun.
Well, there's a lot riding on this project.
That's right.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Alright. Come on, you guys.
Yours, or the turkeys?
What do you know about it?!... Listen, the ghost is too powerful. The only chance we have is to use this machine.  I need you to go get the others and meet us upstairs.
Alright, go to the belt store...
Father, come in, please.
No, I'm fine.
I am Tom Green, I am Tom Green. Daddy want some sausage, sausage. Daddy want some sausage...
Get out?! What does it say?
Mom, Mr. Stubbins is a nimrod!
You don't think...
MURDERED?!!
Always the dentist.
I certainly did not.
Thanks, Mom.
Looks good, Mom!
I'm so happy I could shit.
But, Chip...
That's right.
Farrah Fawcett?! Who's gonna play my brother? Is Jason Priestly available?
Leave her alone, Chip.  I think it's great she has a new beau, Beverly.
Misty, I made your favorite sesame broccoli... 
It's a shame. But they should brush their teeth, honey.
Oh, honey!
Yes, I did.
Not at first, but then I heard the same inflection in a voice at a social gathering and I put two and two together.
Is this the Cocksucker residence?
Isn't this 4215 Pussy Way?
It's not fair!!
But... but... she... Rosemary, I heard her voice! It's her, I tell you, IT'S HER!
Yes, I was.
Mother! Did you hear me?! Someone murdered Carl in the mensroom! I saw his dead body!
Rosemary, honey. Good morning. I'm fine.  Thanks for remembering.
Ewwww!  Thank you, Rosemary.
...Browsing.
Right here!
He's a good boy.
That's no excuse for a morbid imagination. I caught him drawing this in class last week.  Is there a problem at home?
Well, you're doing something wrong, Mrs. Sutphin. I'd recommend therapy for your son.  Thank you for taking the time to come to PTA.
Excuse me, Mrs. Sutphin.
You forgot something...
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
You think my sister is there?
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Which room is it?
I'd like to get out of here.
Yes, I understand.
No.
It doesn't matter. You want to now. You should want to. It's your obligation, your duty.
You're not a dipsomaniac at your age?
She can only use cash.
Oh, as beautiful as ever.
She's nervous, naturally, under the circumstances.
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
But I like teaching school.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
No. She asked about the trademark.
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But you have treated me that way.
Yes.
Oh, I'm making investigations.
Good night.
I don't think that's a good subject for jokes, Mr. Hoag.
I'm looking for a party -- a merry party.
We could tell him.
Not from me.
I'm Mimi -- I'm dying.
I'm afraid.
Why wait?
I won't get lonely.
You will have to make all the jokes, because I'm going to be very serious.
I can imagine.
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
I understand.
I want to see what they read so I'll know what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There's nothing nicer for a gift than a book.
What a peculiar question.
I don't think that you would understand if I told you.
You don't expect me to do that do you?
Tell me what?
I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline. Let her know --
They may have found her.  Mrs. Cortez -— this morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.
You know where she is?
It seems right to us.
Thank you, my dear.
That won't be necessary. I haven't much to say.
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Of course.
I don't know no Gibson. This is a restaurant. Many people come here.
What did he say?
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
When?
I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. "We will avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and can lead to either good or evil."
What about Judd -- he knows about us.
Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.
Are you uncomfortable with my appearance?
Oh. Well, maybe I'm uncomfortable with my appearance. I feel a little out of place in these surroundings.
What about it do you like? I'm not being critical, I'd really like to know.
Yes. So you feel security, stability. Like things are going to last awhile.
I knew him very well. We were extremely close until I dropped out.
What's the first?
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Agreed.
Well, I've been watching you. I've watched you eat, I've watched you speak, I've watched the way you move, and I see somebody who is extremely conscious of being looked at. I think you really believe that people are looking at you all the time. And you know what?
Hah! No, I'm not. Actually, I used to be, but the therapist I had was really ineffectual in helping me deal with my problems. Of course, I lied to him constantly, so I guess I can't hold him totally responsible...
Ann. Hello.
What kind of personal project?
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.
I'm sorry this came up.
Why not?
What difference does it make why I do it?
Absolutely not.
Are there people other than your previous lover that you have fantasized about?
Yes.
If I can't do it all, I don't want to do anything. And I can't do it all.
So you have had sex.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
So you lied to her?
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
No.
As I said, I haven't decided what to do, exactly. Perhaps I won't do anything.
Why not?
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works...  God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see.  And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
You did that?
Are you having an affair?
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
Always the lawyer.
You've made your point.
Quitting your therapy won't feed the children of Ethiopia.
I want out of this marriage.
He does.
Yeah, I know.
Oh, yeah.  But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
Is he still at your house?
Did you find him attractive?
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
Well, what, then?
What kinds of questions?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
There's a phone here.
Why don't you let me tape you?
Yes.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
He said that my hand felt good.
If you wish.  You're not wearing any underwear.
Yes.
Is that what he tells you?
Okay.
So make an exception.
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
Don't give me this passive/aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
In here!!
Oh.  Well, when, then?
I want to see you.
Cynthia. John.
You told Ann about this?
You trust him.
I knew it, I knew it. Things are getting complicated.
Will you lease month-to-month?
You were prying before?
Or go someplace in a hurry.
No.
You're hesitating. I think that means you have.
John Millaney.
Yes?
He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
Was he nice to you?
I can't, dummy. He'll see that the pack's been opened. You're such a dumbhead.
Meeting Rollo at Tudor's. Might take a while.
OK. But late.
Nope. Damned thing wriggled out of my hands. That's all.
I want to be able to see us, Nick. I... I'm going to go into the bathroom now and put in my contacts, OK? Is that OK?  I want to be able to see us when we make love, OK?
Just breathe normally.
Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
You oughta be careful yourself. Might end up cutting your throat.
It looks like -- and I quote -- 'a disease to save man from his mind.'
I'd kinda like to come over there and have a look at one of these guys.
Yeah.  Ah, I don't want to panic you or anything, but, I mean, the way Hobbes designed them, they're supposed to get out of hand real quick, so you don't have much time to think about what's happening to you. Once they decide to start pumping all those dynamite juices into the old blood stream... I dunno. But if you see some people doing kind of compulsive, maybe even bizarre sexual things...
BREAKING OUT
Of course.
On the contrary.  He wants to see your ratings soar.  He needs a woman of exceptional desirability.
I am in Farley's employ -- and...  ...we're discussing a network deal.
I detect a note of reticence. Are you, perhaps, one of those amongst us who feel this emotive form of presentation is overly manipulative?
Bert brought them over from Europe.  They had a very popular series together.  It's still rerun in a lot of countries.  You must have seen them in 'Dentonvale?'
SOME PEOPLE DO IT ON THE PAVEMENT
Shove it, Ralph!
No!  I don't know what Janet's next move will be...but you can be sure of one thing...it all starts here!
YOU'VE LOST YOUR CAUSE
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR EMPLOYMENT
He moved all right!  When they found him with fifteen other naked men at the back of Wilson's Bakery.
Janet.  Janet Majors.  It's just that Brad...my husband...is not... very well and...  I don't want to miss the next episode of Dentonvale.
YOUNG BLOOD
I'm sick of hearing about that lame dog.  I've got a lot going for me.  I'm going places.  I'm going to be someone.  I'm gonna win my way into the lives and hearts of people even if I have to kill to do it.  I'll make the pathetic little crumbs love me. I don't even know why I'm wasting my time here with you.  I should be with my people...
Arrest that man!  He's committed to our care.
Farley!
Flavors!
I can't wait to begin on him. Really, Bert, I don't know what we'd do without you!
Yes, Janet.  Leave the crying to Brad.
LIKE A DEEP PLUM LIPSTICK AND SOME THERAPEUTICS
No.
We're not confused.
It's all in the wrist.  You know, you look really familiar. You from around here? Where'd you go to high school?
I picked him up and I fucked him. I'm a bad girl.
The wallet! He took Derek's wallet!
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Yeah, I'm here.
So I guess that's it.
What are you pouring tonight?
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Highliner.
A famous actor bringing me flowers on my birthday. Don't I feel special?
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
Stephanie.
Hi.  Maya's in the kitchen.
You said you loved me! You fuck! I hope you die!
That's on us.
No, I'm an actor.
Well, in that case...
Yeah, Conundrum.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
Oh yeah. Much better.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
Just a second. Guy's going for $2500.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
I'd rather have a knife.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Let me call Christine.
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100% Pinot Noir.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
It's not even a mile.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
If that's what feels right.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
You know her?
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
I'm a quick learner.
What?
Well, she is cute.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Aye-aye, captain.
I'm fine!
Bathroom.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
She's been leaving messages here too.
What?
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Understanding of what?
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
Yeah.
Nope.
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
What exactly are we going to do?
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
It's private.
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Yeah.
The plan is... you go.
I'm fine. You rest.
You need a new car anyway.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
The Windmill.
Try it.
That's what I'm having.
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
What was the bottle that did it?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Like what a fraud he was.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
What rehearsal dinner?
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Ken.
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
So how're you doing?
I guess.
See you over there, Miles.
About four weeks.
About a year.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
You golf?
Where?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
It tastes old.
I heard them Morgan.
My ballet recital.
Me too.
What?  Colleen?... Colleen?
This is not an intelligent way to approach this.
It's broken Morgan. It'll just keep doing this.  Let's get out of the car okay?
That wasn't the answer you wanted?
What's furry, furry rabbit?
Good choice... I'm going to have a cheeseburger with bacon.  Extra bacon.
They already know we're here.
From what?
Have they said anything about our area?
I know.  We need to be sure, before we open that door Graham.
Graham.
Yes.
I have some upstairs.
I hope they're doing better than we are. We don't even have helmets.
Don't call me Father.
The footprints.
There are none.
I would say so.
Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it, as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn't see him. He stayed mostly in the shadows. All we could make out was movement.  But I'll tell you something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house last night. He was looking in my children's windows and I want you to find him Edgar.  I need you to take this seriously, just in case, it is something serious.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
Why not?
You'll lose the signal!
What book!
Your next water ain't for three days.
McKendrick.
I'm sorry.
I just came out to say goodbye.
Yeah, me and Jake will be heading out for California soon.
Didn't Paden tell you that?
This is a brutal land.
How's Mr. Parker doing?
That I do.
No, Leavenworth.
I had to get up anyway.
Where's the pinto going?
Which way do you mean?
I understand.
No hard feelings.
I've got a job.
She's gone, gone to town. She hated working on the farm...  ...just like you.
The cattle! This valley runs down to a clear creek. That's why we picked this spot, and that's why they don't want us here.
Whose law? The law here runs a man down -- just like these cattle.
I don't believe in luck. I know what Conrad was like. Don't tell me what you think I want to hear.
We got married just before this trip, so we could come out here and try the land. It's hard to find a man willing to take on a life like that.
His son is worse than he was. He's smoother, so you don't always hear him coming, but he'll do anything to keep his range free.
We didn't get that far.
Really?
I wanted a drink and a bed. I guess I came to the wrong place.
What are you doing here? I thought you were done with our family.
Oh that's just fine. Where were you when Ma and Daddy needed you? It's too late, Mal. Now you finally show up and all you can think of is to get yourself killed.
It's none of your business.
Because you're my sister. There's nobody else.  The men who killed Daddy are after Jake. I gotta talk to him.
They're watching the Hollis place. I can't get through.
Where's Emmett now?
I heard that too.
So have I. I've got a legitimate job now. I can use a guy like you.
Well I'm real happy for you, Cobb. But I think I'll keep looking for mine.
Nothing. Do nothing. Don't get between us.
So we understand each other?
Yeah, maybe I will too.
I saw how you're putting Mal Johnson straight.
Yeah. Bad luck.  Good-bye, Cobb.
I am. I'm always there, but I only shine at night.
Me too. What's wrong with us?
So-called?
Why'd you go into business with him?
Who's the owner?
Who?
No!!  I can prove it to you.  I'll take you to her.
No, I understand.  That's what I want to talk about.  I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
It sounds like you still have feelings for him.
We can hardly make a profit with them.  Up-front salary, back-end deal, perks, per diem, percentages -- They're mocking us, Elaine. We're at their mercy.  We always had movie stars but they used to be our stars.  We used to decide who would play what role. We told them what to wear, what to say, who to date.  When they were under contract, we could change their names if we wanted to -- more than once!
You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
I don't need a star.  All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor.  A real leading lady.
I don't know if that's going to happen.
She's my actor.  There are other studios, Elaine.  There's only one Simone.  Leave the press conference to me.
"Forever".
There aren't any.  If the filmmakers are happy, Simone's happy.  She considers herself an... "instrument".
She'll do her own.  Theater training.
I'll send you her resume.
No need.  She does all her own stunts.
Simone does not control my destiny.
That's genius, Viktor.  Was that Simone's idea?
Thank you.  I'll tell Simone you liked it.
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
She said you were very beautiful.
I do?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
She's lying down.  She's exhausted.
When is she coming over?
I know.  I know.  They'll say anything.
I would rather have you than Simone.  Believe me.
Not if I don't let her.
Every actor is an invention, Viktor.  Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone.  But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
That sounds wonderful.  How do you feel about all this, Lainey?
No... it's life.
Right beside you.  I borrowed Viktor's car.
Sometimes.  But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever.  He took the credit for Simone tonight.
Just a minute.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
Is that a problem?
I just think actors talk too much. Does the world really want to hear your life story just because you've got a movie opening Friday?
Clyde.
It was more in passing.
How did the wall get there?
I know what you mean.
I need flesh and --
-- You finished the film on your own terms, that's what matters. Did you really do all the post yourself?
I saw her picture on the, er... internet.  You really didn't notice anything -- unusual?
If anyone asks about Simone --
Night, Lainey.
I do okay.  How about you?
I'll see what I can do.  You know, Lainey.  I don't believe you've ever once asked to meet Simone.  Don't you like her?
I could get the death penalty.
I'd like to see that, Sayer. Invite me.
I don't have time for this, Sayer.
-- I bet you have.
Abduction?
Don't you?
Why?
Which means they're significant.  Incriminating.  Perhaps, criminal.  She's hiding her past.  She's hiding her past.
What do you want -- ?
-- Cashier's check went out to our anonymous tipster this morning -- worth every penny too.  Who says there's no place for checkbook journalism?  We'll be running stills of this for months, then release the whole tape -- we'll get our money back -- maybe show it on an exclusive pay-per-view event. Do you realize what we have here? We have the only independent footage of Simone in existence.
Is that why she left you?
Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Taransky.
Do you have any idea what this means, Simone?  Our ability to manufacture fraud now exceeds our ability to detect it.
You know what I'm talking about.
Why do you have to bring that up? There's always risk -- life's a risk.  It's worth it.  Besides, how could something so lovely be a crime?  Well, I think we've done enough for today.  You've been cooped up in there too long.  How about you and me go out on the town?  They're expecting us.
Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack for the bedroom.
What? You don't see enough of me at the store?
What, Anna? What did I do? What's made you so sad?
No, just one.
Congratulations.
That I'm a freak.
Upset words.
I forgot myself.
Dr. Crowe.
You haven't told bedtime stories before?
You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe they run out of gas.
No, walking around, like regular people... They can't see each other. Some of them don't know they're dead.
All the time. They're everywhere.  You won't tell anyone my secret, right?
Will you stay here till I fall asleep?
And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all standing up?
Yes.
I don't know.
I don't know, Cole.
Don't give up. You're the only one who can help me. I know it.
It means I wasn't what everyone thought I was...  I was a fake.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
No, we're not.
You do?
Yeah.
Ghosts.
They want me to do things for them.
...I don't know.
They were the ones who hanged everybody.
You talked funny when you went to school here. You talked funny all the way to high school!
Who!
S-ssstop that!
S-ssssstop it!
Meaning?
Let's say today, we make it your business.
Superstition.
Oh yeah? Why's that?
You were a beat and a quarter behind.
Fuck me? Fuck YOU!!
Slut.
Suzie, face it. The only "axe" he's picked up since we came here... is a real one. He doesn't give a damn about the band anymore... or about you.
Book of Jeremiah.
Yeah. Marvin's old man gunned him down.
I am not! I'm telling you, it's worth its weight in gold.
Cowshit? Are you sure the Aztecs even had cows?
It harvests! It threshes! Look at these blades.
Metaphysical question, man.
Depends. You got some nerve intruding on a man's grief. I bet I could pull this trigger right now and call it justifiable homicide. Now: who are you?
Ain't nobody mentioned that name on this farm for 14 years. My boy was taken from me... far as I'm concerned, he's dead. Now, I ain't gonna ask you again. -- Who are you?!
Broke her heart you never visited... But I always said you'd come back.
This is his room... isn't it?
"Blood?"
Who? Us?!
You got something against farm people, Keith?
What?! You mean... I slept on this couch for nothing?!
Nothing to tell.
Billy Bob's dead. -- We were wrong -- he didn't do anything. I-It's the scarecrow --
I hurt my leg. Diving away from the Harvester -- it almost got me.
It's you. You and your father.
Don't look.
You've been... hiding him all these years. Helping him... irrigate the land. With blood...
Can't help it, Suze... family sticks together...
What'll we do?
I know what people say, Bill. I... Remember, back in high school I worked at my father's gas station?
Well, big ol' Lincoln, sure. Guess I would have flirted with him too.
Hell, Starla. I always regretted that.
We can't make it. Just get away, when you get the chance.
You took Bill.
Oh yeah. Fuck you, fat ass.
What do you see? I see a butterfly.
Shelby, shut up. Keep an eye out for these things. If you see 'em, keep your mouth covered. Otherwise they'll go straight down it. All right?
Work thing hell, Starla. He just wants to get in your pussy. Him and most these other ones around here. That's where their minds is at, them sick fucks.
I'm sorry. I don't just have some switch.
Grant, no!
Through a wound on his stomach?
An animal that doesn't procreate. It spreads, grows. A living disease.
Margaret.
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Your what?
What's the matter? Legend has it Bandit LaRue's king of the road.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
They're both a challenge.
Would I lie to you?
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
He's after us again!
Yeah.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
How do you know?
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Yeah?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
Weight Station.
See ya, Kate.
Because I need your help, sweet thing.  And I need it bad.
I'll do it.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner?  Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
Running blocker.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
I'm cucumber cool.
What's that, pardner?
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
Go head on, breaker.
Bandit, this is Mister B, and I'm gearjamming this rolling refinery. You got another Smokey on the rubber?
Some boy named Bandit's been givin' the Highway Patrol shit fits.
Chickenshit money.
-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
Well, we were worried about dust and debris from the work being done ruining the cameras, so--
Of course. Yes.
Only the mention made in that phone call. There's no Swedish hitman of any renown, much less one with a million dollar day rate.
Maybe.
Heller was buried in agency lore, anytime an operative failed or was perceived to have failed, Hoover blackballed their memory. Look at Ness.
That's happening in about ten minutes. Israel's at optimum risk of flight right now, so we can't wait.
Have them mobilized. I'll phone security and have the elevators locked down and stairwells secured. We need to keep Israel sequestered in that penthouse.
Yeah, uh -- it was Spanish-somethin' Garcia, or Diego, uh --
-- he was wearing one of our jackets.
The other agent. He said he was here to do an inspection and later, when he got on the elevator with the other guy, Carruthers, I saw him wearing one of our security jackets...
And threw us into the lake.
Yeah, why.
Then what --
I got his machine.
I said I got his machine.
Look at that, we didn't have to fill up the whole blackboard after all. Now, do you know anything about that?
GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT!
I don't have to do shit! Which includes cooperating any further with these motherfuckers until I get what I want!  Alright, fuck it, if we gotta hand 'em somebody from our end and they're being hard-ons about it -- make it Hugo, him I don't mind. He needs that regimented thing that prison provides --
I thought Heller was a double op?
You think it's possible he could be involved in the Israel hit?
-- will be handled back in --
And you just figured that out?  The Swede isn't a hitman, is he? He's a surgeon. Sparazza didn't want Israel's heart for a trophy, he wanted it for a transplant... why?
So all of our intel was bogus to begin with.
Information was arriving all day yesterday. When we finally figured out who Sparazza actually was, we --
Nah, nuthin' on my end --
-- okay, g'head --
Yeah, y'ain't heard the punchline, yet and before I get to it, one more thing I heard, little curious, should probably bring it up... Primo wants Israel's heart. The actual thing, the organ.
Hey, we nab Israel, they pay t'get'm back, I'll cut the fuckin' thing out m'self, no extra charge. My thing is, we crew up, let's not fuck around, someone's cousin, some Zip off the boat from Naples, let's get pros, people who know how to behave.
A million flat.
Well, uh -- damn, alright, so he's headed in, does that -- where does that leave us?
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets.  Plus you stank.
I can trust Rheya.
You're not Gibarian...
All right.
The same thing that could happen to any of us.
What?
How much sleep?
What was it?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying.  Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything.  Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Yes.
Her oxygen would have run out.
I won't be making the trip.
Why?
Yes.
Book?
He does have a point.  That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out.  Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless.  Unblinking in his prejudice.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me.  That's all I know right now.
Neither can I.  Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap.  There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
I want you here.
Yes.  I told you.  It was exactly like mine.
I want to stop taking those pills.
You must have been dreaming.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
He thinks you're being a little careless.  He made the point several times.
Beg pardon?
I got money.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Urdu and Hindi.
They're kind of fuzzy.
No kidding.
No, no seriously!  There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Hey.  This is my business.  Do I tell you your business.
You don't like him, do you?
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
No, you'll be safe.  We're gonna pick him up again...
Claire...!
Let go!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
They called here after you left...
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
Do you dance?
Pretty bad.
Yeah.
I know.
I don't know...
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Nothing.
Sure we are, let's go!
Too kinky.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
'Til they pick up the perp.  Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
I can still use a gun.
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
Oh, some shit.
I don't know that Ellie.  He might get out.  Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
Why?
No!  No!  I'm sorry.  Ninety-seven five right?
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
Ellie, it was a formal party...
She bought it.
Take it easy!  I set her up.  I saw it coming.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
Well.  This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
You talked to his wife?
I'm all right.
Me neither.
You apprehended him after he gave himself up --
If she identifies him.  Where the fuck were you anyway, cowboy!  Venza was meat.  He walked right past you, and now we're the ones playing catch-up!  You better hope she identifies him.
Koontz!  I need you guys!
Bad fuckin' news.  Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands.  But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried.  It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone.  Help me out here, could you please leave.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say.  Joey.  I want to help you out of this.
I get my hostage first.  No one's turned loose until I say so.
Oh, beware of jealousy, my lord, the green-eyed monster...
You stop him?
No, no.
Oh, come on, Ben ,that's not--
I was sort of hoping to get out of--
They'll never take me alive.
Well, I've missed a lot of classes myself...
Oh, look, Mr. Hogan, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really--
Right.
I don't submit to blackmail!  The first amendment protects my freedom to tell the news as I imagine it, and--
Sorry. I'm still getting the hang of this.
Just call me Spidey.
Well...
When Peter was little, he loved to hide.  In closets, under the sink. He needed a secret place.  But when I'd look for him, he'd laugh... he wanted to be found.
I hate your relatives, I hate your coffee, I hate your shoes.
Thank God.
So?  The next day I'd read, "Peter Parker murdered," and I'd feel...
Listen.  You think you're responsible for everything that happens.  Don't flagellate yourself - and don't flatter yourself, either.  You're not the center of the universe. You're just... Peter.
Hello.  So very boring.  Peter Parker, how do you feel about me this morning?
But you said he went off a little, after the accident, when those mechanical arms--
Your records are older than you are.  Have you never heard of new wave?
Yes.  Do you have a date?
It'll shut itself off.
How is he?
Ach, theories!  This was first hand, experiential knowledge, the essence of the universe.
Oh, Roz.  My mind is so far beyond yours now.  I could beat you at chess now.
Actually, I got this spider bite…
Luck.  The right place at the right time.
Oh. Yeah.  Thanks.
Oh-- I don't know-- thanks, Mr. Reiss, but--
Explain that some jerk in a mask and costume fought a mad scientist with four tentacles?
Yeah, just a lung full of New Jersey.  Lucky you showed up when you did.
Imagine how I feel.
Just drop me off here.
Sure, in the war.  Pull those cables--
Is you all little Adolfs?
I don't have to think. We didn't tell anything to anybody. Not a word. Not until we hit this barrack.
That'll do.
In this barracks?
Anybody here wanna double their bet?
You stink, Sefton!
Maybe it's going to be a longer war than you figured -- eh, Duke?
That's right.
Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
I'll call the whole pot.
Easy! Walked right through the gate, past the guard. Like he was some Kraut Field Marshal.
Only he ain't quite finished yet. Blondie -- get that smudge pot. Tie it to Steve's leg.
Such nice boys! It makes me sick to --
Twenty-five.
What is your number?
That is correct.  Lieutenant Dunbar, I came to apologize for the accommodations. Ordinarily, of course, we never put officers up with enlisted men.
Abfuehren!
I want to sleep... I haven't slept for three days.
They also smell of moth balls.  When were they issued? This morning?
All I know is he did it. I am satisfied.
Some are not bad at all.
Droppen Sie dead!  Raus mit dem Ofen. Los! Los!
What's the award?
Blind? How stupid can you get, Animal? I drank the stuff myself.
What do they always say?
You want to go?
Yes, sir.
Kill it, Duke. It's got us all spinning.
Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
Good.
You have elected me Security. The way things have been going in this Barracks, I guess I've done a poor job and I want to make up for it. Is that asking too much?
Because that's where he is. In the water tank.
Lay off, Schulz. He's got a sickness. He's krank.
One more thing, gentlemen. The Kommandant told me to pick up the radio.
Just one question. Did you calculate the risk?
Are we boring you?
Says who?
That's right. Or would you rather see Dunbar lying out there in the mud tomorrow morning like Manfredi and Johnson?
You told them, Hoffy.
Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.  Sprechen sie deutsch?
Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?
Maybe just one word? Kaput? Because you're kaput, Price.
What time?
Suppose you let those mattresses cool off a little -- just out of decency?
Ich weiss alles.
Here. Take them.
Talk what? I do not know anything!
Not particularly.
We'll put pink ribbons on the bedbugs.
Maybe those Russian dames would take him.
He is.
The star's destruction has had numerous astro-physical effects within this sector. However, none of them appear to have a connection to the energy ribbon.
No, sir. I am finding it difficult to concentrate. I believe I am overwhelmed with feelings of remorse and regret concerning my actions on the observatory.
Guilt. It is a most unpleasant feeling.
I believe so.
I believe so.
You get what?
The station complement was nineteen.
I hope so, sir.
All hands, brace for impact!
Wherever he wanted to be.
Yes, where would you go?
Yes, yes, it is.
I'm from what you would consider the future; the 24th-century.
Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of-
Better?
Least I could do for a captain of the Enterprise.
What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
And what would that be, sir?
No.
No, I didn't know that.
No, sir.
Understood. That will be all.
A quantum implosion has occurred within the Amargosa star. All nuclearfusion is breaking down.
Yes. Fine. If you'll excuse me.
What I can't get out of my mind is the image of Rene- my nephew. I just can't believe he's gone.
Mr. Data, scan the planet for lifeforms.
Why were they looking for it on a Federation observatory? It doesn't make any sense.
Lursa and B'Etor? This doesn't make any sense. A renowned stellar physicist somehow uses a trilithium probe to destroy a star, kidnaps Geordi and escapes with a pair of Klingon renegades. Why? What the hell's going on?
If he tries to get away with Warp Drive, he's really in for a shock...
He has been here for some time. I can feel his presence.
Yes, sir, I sealed the room myself. Nevertheless -- I am reading a life form there.
I can't get an answer. Starfleet is up to its brass in galactic conference. No one has time for those who only stand... and wait.
Message acknowledged. All units will be informed.
Mr. Scott, we need everything you've got now.
Nothing. As before.
Short range scan, Mr. Chekov... On screen, Mr. Sulu.
It has to be. Gravitational fields were in flux... It must have soft landed...!
Like your father... so human.  All units functional, recorders are on... Scanning sector one. Foliage in fully developed state of growth. Temperature, twenty- two point two Celsius.
A photon tube...!
My mother knew nothing about it. That's why I asked her to leave Genesis in my hands.
... How long?
I'll go...
Yes, Saavik, go ahead...
I know, but -- let's do it by the book. Stand by on this channel.  Go.
Sir...?
Saavik... Is... David with you?
But we have Spock alive! That's more than we bargained for!
And if they don't.? What will Happen to Spock?
The word is no.  I am therefore going anyway.
I'll need it, Sulu.
... A cloaking device?
It's been a while, sir. Here we go... Retrothrusters!
Approach control... this is Enterprise. Ready for docking maneuver.
That's the good news. He's home in bed, full of tranquilizers, and he promised me he'd <U>stay</U> there... They say it's exhaustion...  We'll see.
That's out of the question. No one is going to Genesis!
Don't quote rules, Harry! We're talking about loyalty. And sacrifice. One man who died for us, another who has deep emotional damage --
Any time.
All right, damn you! All right!  Give me a minute to inform my crew.
You should take the Vulcan, too.
You fool -- look around you! This planet is destroying itself!
He would not have spoken of it openly.
One alive, one not. Yet both in pain.
Success, my lord.
Good.  This is the turn of luck I have been waiting for.
They are useless! It was Kirk I needed. And I let him slip away.
I'm afraid I can't stop to discuss this logically --
I only use it for medicinal purposes. Don't be a pring...
Four hundred years old. You don't find many with the lens still intact.
Amazing! I don't know what to say --
And who am I hiding from?
I'm your doctor and I'm your friend, Jim. Get back your command. Get it back before you really do grow old. Before you turn into part of this collection.
Ah.
As a physician you of all people should appreciate the danger of re-opening old wounds.
This one looks like a Steward. They're not warm, but rigor hasn't set in. This didn't happen all that long ago, Jim.
And almost got tossed out of the Academy...
Why? Why didn't you tell me?
And bored. I know. But maybe it IS something they can...
Mother, go back!
We've picked up a minor energy flux reading on one dyno scanner.
Ssssh!
What's the matter -- ?
Marooned on Ceti Alpha V. He's completely mad, Admiral. He blames you for the death of his wife...
Then to whom do you report directly regarding Genesis?
I see. Helmsman?
<u>We were still there</u>, you dumb bastard! We could hear the screams all the way to the transporter room --
She's making it up! My father was Professor --
<u>Full power damn you</u>!
Aye, sir.
Scotty, let's have it.
My sister's youngest, Admiral. Crazy to get to space.
All right, we'll do the job with auxiliary power.
Engine room reports auxiliary power restored. We can proceed at impulse power.
Right on schedule, Admiral. Just give us your coordinates and we'll beam you aboard.
Welcome aboard, Admiral. I believe you know my trainee crew. Certainly they have come to know you.
Regula I is a scientific research laboratory, if memory serves...
Excuse my presumption, but I do not agree. As a teacher on a training mission, I am content to command a Starship. If we are to go on actual duty, it is clear that the senior officer aboard must assume command.
You proceed from a false assumption. I am a Vulcan. I have no ego to bruise.
I'd best talk with Mr. Scott, first so that he may, in his own words, explain the situation to his cadets.
The power of creation --
Chekov's on Reliant, isn't he?
It would explain a great many things --
Raise shields! Energize phasers, stand by to --
Who the <u>hell</u> are they?
It's all we've got.
Engine room... Scotty, do we have enough power for the transporters?
Yes, sir.
Transmission jammed at the source, sir.
There is no correct resolution. It is a test of character.
You may ask, Lieutenant.
Phasers on stun. Move out.
As your teacher Mr. Spock is fond of saying: I like to think there always are possibilities.
I reprogrammed the simulation so it was possible to rescue the ship.
At what.
Aye, sir.
Understood, sir.
Aye, sir --
I am delighted; any chance to go aboard Enterprise, however briefly, is always an excuse for nostalgia.
Engage warp engines --
Try again.
Battle stations.
I'll try, Captain.
No power to the weapons system, sir.
What did you expect, Lieutenant?
Thank you, Mr. Saavik.
Lieutenant, the Admiral is aware of the Regulations.
By the book...
Spock. Does the good of the many outweigh the good of the one...?
Then you stand here alive because of a mistake -- made by your flawed, feeling, human friends. They have sacrificed their futures because they believed that the good of the <u>one</u> -- you -- was more important to them.
Bob... it's tearing me apart.
I tried to clear things up, Professor Scott. I explained you'd come all the way from Edinburgh on appointment to study manufacturing methods here at Plexico, but they don't seem to know anything about it.
Would you prefer to do nothing?
Let's hope so, Bones. Mr. Sulu, set us down in Golden Gate Park.
Pavel, can you hear me? Give me your name and rank...
It would be impossible to discuss the subject without a common frame of reference.
Pardon me, Doctor, I am hearing many calls of distress.
I liked him better before he died.
That's crazy! Who would send a probe hundreds of light years to talk to a whale?
... Best shot...?
No, Spock. It means he feels safer about your "guesses" than most other peoples facts.
Reading the patient's vital signs.
How do you explain slowing pulse, low respiratory rate and coma?
Fundoscopic examination is unrevealing in these cases!
My God, man, drilling holes in his head is not the answer. The artery must be repaired without delay or he will die! So put away your butcher knives and let me save the patient!
Captain, their call is being carried on an amplification wave of enormous power!
It gives me a great sense of danger. We have to beam in next to the reactor room, not in it.
No, <u>my</u> name.
Mr. President, the Probe has passed through all quadrants. The starships Shepard and Yorktown and three smaller vessels have been neutralized.
Communicate? Communicate what? You have no right to be here!
You're not one of those guys from the military, are you? Trying to teach whales to retrieve torpedoes, or some dipshit stuff like that?
To put it mildly. Since the dawn of time, men have harvested whales for a variety of purposes, most of which can be achieved synthetically at this point. A hundred years ago, using hand-thrown harpoons, they did plenty of damage -- but that was nothing compared to what they've achieved in this century.
How soon?
You've already been that. C'mon.
In fact, we may be able to help -- in ways that, frankly, you couldn't possibly imagine.
Very likely. You're not exactly catching us at our best.
Just lucky, I guess.
What's what?
Tell me when the whales are going to be released?
You asked.  Now, will you tell me something?  George and Gracie's transmitter. What's the frequency?
Right.
Yes... And I'm glad you're here. Though I'll admit, you picked a hellova time to drop in...
Have I flipped out? ... Is any of this real?
What do I care? I've got nobody but those whales...
You're going to your ship, I'm going to mine. Science Vessel. I've got 300 years of catch-up learning to do.
Don't worry. I'll find <u>you</u>.  See you around the galaxy...
The sounds, but not the language. We would be responding in gibberish.
There is one, but I cannot guarantee its success. We could attempt to find some Humpback Whales.
What are the variables...?
How do you know this...?
Admiral, if we were to assume these. whales are ours to do with as we please, we would be as guilty as those who caused their extinction.
The hell I can't
Admiral, you must wait one damn minute.
Hardly, Admiral, I cannot even guarantee we will escape the Sun's gravity! I will attempt to compensate by altering our trajectory.
No data, Admiral. Computers are non-functional.
Mr. Sulu, we need breakaway speed!
Hover on my mark, Mr. Sulu! Mr. Chekov, stand by de-cloaking -- Scotty, ready for power build up!  Mark, Mr. Sulu...
Picture, Uhura!
Overlapping distress calls. Some from Starships... others...
From a city? That doesn't make sense....
On screen.
Give me one more day, sir. The damage control is easy. Reading Klingon is hard.
About 60 feet, Admiral.
I suppose I can, sir; are you planning to take a swim?
Not good enough, Scotty. You've got to do better!
No power to the bay doors.
Scotty, don't prejudge. A ship is a ship.
Don't concern yourself, Saavik. Your leave has been granted for good and proper cause.  How are you feeling?
Yes, Admiral.  Sir. I have not had the opportunity to tell you about your son.  David died most bravely. He saved Spock. He saved us all... I thought you should know.
Millions?
... Yes?
Gomen nasarei. Hito chigai de gozaranuka na.  I'm sorry, my son. You have mis- taken me for someone else.
Your directive apparently doesn't include spying on other cultures.
We've always known that to survive, we had to remain apart. It hasn't been easy. Many of the young people here want to know more about the offland... they're attracted to stories of a faster pace of life...
But not you.
... an offlander?
I'll be here.
The "mighty" Federation could learn a few things from this village...
You're what?
I understand.
Perhaps, that is true.
It is safer there. I will join you shortly.
The artificial lifeform was right?
Captain, Geordi...?
What possible purpose could a duplicate village have except... to deceive the Ba'ku...
I don't know.
I prefer to wait until we can share the benefits with all the people of the Federation...
He's right. Our shields have been upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies...
Talk... we should send down an assault team and take them by force.
That's probably not a good idea. Your ship hasn't been fitted for this region; there are environmental concerns...
This was too important for the Enterprise to be on the sidelines, Admiral...
Understood.
... or understand that they were participating in the outright theft of a world.  I won't let you move them, Admiral. I'll go to the Federation Council...
There are metaphasic particles all over The Briar Patch. Why must this planet be...
If a court-martial is the only way to tell the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.
Is this how a Federation officer begs for his life?
No, sir. But it wasn't easy... being among them...
Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of their support craft went down to the surface.  It appeared to be the Captain's Yacht. Five persons on board.
May I talk to you alone?
No one hated them more than you, Gal'na.  We've come a long way together. This is the moment we've planned for so many years...
When I was an ensign, I could detect a three-micron mis- alignment...
The Son'a reports claim they didn't fire until after he malfunctioned.
So, you're saying he still knew the difference between right and wrong.
It's nothing. I'm just tired.
Negative. I want to use the ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can...
On screen.
Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon gas... we don't want to go in there, sir...
We can't delay the archaeological expedition to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season...
We won't be able to go any faster than one-third impulse in that muck...
We're not going anywhere.
Aye, sir.
No, we're here to... rescue them.
We're coming as fast as we can... we can't risk using phasers...
It's good to have you back, Worf.  Slow to one-third. Take us in.
Sir?
Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor beam, Mister Worf.
Better have the chef whip up a light balsamic vinaigrette... something that goes well with chrysanthemums...
Why was Data assigned?
What are they interested in...?
Was I doing something to your neck?
But it's comfortable.
Or you could try lying down.
... Doctor Crusher has something that'll take care of that...
They must have been locked and secured after we were beamed here.
Absolutely.
Yes...
Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now.
How did Doctor Almack react to that?
You want some advice? Don't do this again.  You know exactly what I mean.
I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our "sense of duty." We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not.
Um... yeah.  Now he's going to need a respirator. Do you have one?
They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny...
No... no, please... you cannot...
What?
I am the Borg.
How serious is the damage?
There should be some kind of manual release...
It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface.
Always am.
<U>Engage.</U>
We're crossing the threshold!
California. San Francisco.
I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing.
The invasion plans.
Ah... yes... but, I didn't realize that --
Yes... I wanted to ask you about some photographs I saw out at the silo. There were three of them... printed on some kind of fabric.
'Fraid not.
I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Don't flatter yourself. I take pictures of a lot of junk.
Myself... and a few other friends of Zephram's.
Western hemisphere... North American continent...
They did it... they assimilated Earth.
We're still in Earth orbit.
Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes.
Assign another team if you need to. I want to re-establish communication with the Captain as soon as possible.
We'll have to assume they've been assimilated into the Collective.
We have to cover both possibilities.  We'll take care of the Bridge. Worf, take your men and seal off Main Engineering. Turn it into a fortress -- nothing gets in.
They appear to be modifying the deflector dish.
I guess I'd better get it right the first time.
The Borg.  Some of them must've beamed over before we destroyed their ship.  Seal off that entire deck with emergency force fields.
What are you suggesting?
Commander... we have a problem.
At present I'm awaiting a full report from Enterprise. Pending that I am constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
We DO sleep lying down.
Thank you, nurse. Jim, she's ready! Lock and load!
We WERE beginning to hit our stride together, doctor...
What's the Brotherhood of Aliens?
Come on...
And the good news is they're not going to prosecute.
Captain, shall we attempt to return fire?
In space, no one can hear you sweat.
They'll make it look like an accident...
I don't mind. Smuggling. Guilty. I come from Arc. Smuggling is an ancient and respected trade there.
That's a comfort...
I beg your pardon?
How can I trust --
He just tried to save him!
Isn't it a fact that you served Romulan ale, a beverage illegal in the Federation because of its overwhelming potency?
There... were no other ships in the sector.
That we fired two photon torpedoes. But -
Those words WERE spoken by me.
Captain Sulu... on assignment... anyone seen Spock?
Full diplomatic courtesy, Mr. Chekov...
Torpedo bay! DID we fire those torpedoes?
Who else?
But if she's cloaked...
Shields up. Battle stations.
Aye, sir; thrusters...
Now we go to Starfleet?
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Do we report this, sir?
Uh, would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard Enterprise with my officers as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
Commander, face to face at last.. you have my thanks..
Except us.
Energize...
Saavik, sir. We were told you'd need a helmsman -  ... so I volunteered.
Plot a course for Kronos, Lieutenant.
Uhura, signal our surrender.
I won't allow Starfleet to be dismantled over some Klingon promises.
Sulu!
Curiously it appears to emanate from us.
He was just about to explain the whole damn -
What peace conference?
You were right: it was arrogant presumption that got us into this situation. You might have died.
Probably trying to figure out why we're reversing, wondering if we detect her.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is the Starship Enterprise, Captain James Kirk commanding.
Who else?
Sir, I speak to you as a kindred intellect. Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
Faith...?
In the meantime we must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight. According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
Such things have happened before, sir.
I don't want to.
You've betrayed the Federation - all of you.
Signal Starfleet that... we have no idea location of Enterprise.
We'll have to check every one of them, Mr. Scott.
Then someone forged a data bank entry.
This one can.
Yes, sir.
He's placing himself in a most awkward position...
I was taken from my homeworld by people called the "PakJeds." They are fat. They traded me to a ship belonging to the "Bolians." The "Bolians" are blue. They put me in a seat and asked me questions. Then they were attacked by another ship...
No.
Because you are dangerous.
You have been programmed to gather information that can be used against this ship.
No.
No. Can I move now?
For how long?
Understood. Keep on it. I need to know what he has and how to neutralize any threat. Give me options.
Is he very much like you were?
It would appear so.
We'll find a way off together. Recommendations?
Port thrusters, sir. Would you like me to drive?
It's interfering with our uplink from Starfleet cartography?
You are not looking at your- self. You are looking at me.
Captain, I don't recommend transporting, that ion storm doesn't look very neighborly. -It could head this way with- out much warning .
An individual more like you, you mean.
Maybe he's not supposed to be like you. Maybe he's supposed to be just like he is.
Emergency force fields are holding.

The resemblance is... striking.
I would like to pick you up now. May I do that?
The least I could do for you, Deanna.  Besides, you know me... I’m a talking head.
As much as we care for him, Deanna... we have to remember that Data isn't capable of disappointment.
How could I not?
Permission denied. If you can possibly endure any more of these assaults.  I need you at my side. Now more than ever I...
I know how he thinks.
Your timing is impeccable, Commander.
When this is over, I owe you a drink.
What do we know about the planet?
Which is why our initial scans didn't pick it up. But he's got it, Captain.
Aye, sir.
Sir, we won’t be able to bring you back. It’s a one way trip. Captain, I don't know if the transporter...
Just lucky, Admiral.
If you don't mind.
Your new chair, sir.
Still well on our side...
Thank you, sir...
I appreciate your concern, Number One, but I've been itching to try out the Argo.
Counselor?
And the Romulans invade.
She's the most beautiful ship I’ve ever seen.
When your first officer insists that you can't go on away missions... Ignore him.
Praetor Shinzon. We’re not here to discuss your lack of a social life.
I know.
You'll acquire a taste for it.
You're doing this to liberate the Remans?
There's so much, and so much of it is dull...
No. I was the first Picard to leave Earth.  It caused quite a stir, In fact. But I had spent my whole life...
I always hoped I would hit two meters.
You're not Reman.
We are.
So if I gave you my life, what would you do with it? Would you spend the years in a blaze of hatred as you are now? Or could you change? Could you try to remember a mother's touch you never felt? A father's words you never heard? Could you do that?
Please.
It is... invigorating.
Find her again.
She is here.
None.
I came this far alone ...
You don't have to understand.
Silence, Romulan!
I don't want to scare them away.
How much are your rooms?
I'll have to run your card off now.
It's still the full price.
We should have. Let me see.
I understand.
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
It's in a green Mustang?
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Shermin...
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
What?
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
Marc Shermin.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
What.
Ah no.
Eh... police.
Good.
Smile.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Space?
Shit?
You better.
I do not understand.
Yes.
No.
Why?
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
I am your friend.
Why?
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
I can't stay on this planet.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
You're damn right I am.
Nothing.
Do they talk?!
I understand.
I gave you a baby last night.
Yes.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
I will say that we can be friends.
Many, many days and nights...
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
Call the police!!
Hey, she doesn't want to go with you. Come on.
In the cars, too?!
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow.
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
Yes.
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
I don't understand.
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
I wouldn't think so.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Okay cash!  Logical.  Here's everything I have on me, what do you say?  How about a Rolex?
No problem.
You're too goddamned paranoid.
A tragic story, no doubt.  How'd you get up here?
Maybe now you appreciate the danger we're in.  It was touching the way you stood by me in there.  "Stand by your man". I was moved.  You were very good.  I don't think he even understands that you did it for him.
I know.  Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
What?  He gonna record you on his label?
Max Pelcher?  You're kidding?
Can't do it.
Iris is dead.  She was murdered.
Don't know.  But this guy's real damaged goods.  Iris knew someone was after her... and she said you were in danger too.  Now no more games, Faith.  Whatever you're hiding, whatever's going on, you have to get out of here now. Come with me right now.  Don't even think about it.
Okay.  It was funny.  But it cost me money.
Shutup a second!
Not now... I don't want to think about it--
I'm on her, amigo.  No worries. Gotta jam.
I intend to.
Where's Faith?
And who was, regrettably, also your best fucking friend.
Well you could've at least warned me.  You know I hate the zap... when they die.  It just brings down your whole day.  Jeez, Tick.
Yeah, when did that start?  Come on, man!  It's what people want to see, and you know it.
Ha!  That's for fucking sure.
Wait, wait... wait a minute.  Iris was here?!
She never gave me a tape.
Faith, can I talk to you a second?
They jerked my wheels, d'you believe it?  I mean it's outrageous, the computer errors the banks are making lately.  Have you noticed?
Mace!  You're a life-saver.
Coming with you.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
Go to the Sunset Sheraton.  RIGHT NOW!  Just go!  GO!
Snuff clip.  It was Iris.  She said she needed my help and I... aw Jesus, Mace... the sick fucker killed her.
I've never dealt in black-jacks. Never.  Everybody knows that.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up.  But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Now you're really getting paranoid.
OK.  He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
Easy, there, Mom.  Easy.  This is audio only.  John Coltrane.  "A Love Supreme." Give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.
It's in my case.  Okay?  I'm going to open my case...
Take it easy.  The glass is bullet resistant.
You sure?
Well, look at the plus side.
Yeah.  You gave up your hot tub tape to save me.  That's real progress for you.
Yeah, right, blow it open.
Lenny... shutup.  Just park your mouth and listen.  It's a set-up. Think about it!  Why's he been sending you tapes?  To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion.  This guy's bent enough to think of that.
You never told me.
No, it's not.
No.  They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
Uh unh.
And do what?  Take on his whole posse?
See you downtown.
Aw, Mom!
Take the tape to the cops.
Um... he was older.
The bearded guy, the creep. Oh, one other thing. Testa, if that's his name, he kept mentioning my feet. Said I had very pretty feet.
Just mopping up. Nine bodies in all.
No, sir.
Mack, this is Sheriff Dylan.
What's the bad news?
Tape it off, we'll want to fine-tooth- comb it. My guess is that the UNSUB is having us on. He checks in, pays, picks up the key, but never walks inside. Tell me if I'm wrong.
I want to talk about the Karen Sumpter case.
She's buried.
We need to run this through VICAP, search for similar burns.
This is Agent Mackelway.
Not a discrepancy, an error. My capacity is 5.5 tons, not 6.
It's been customized for sleeping capacity.
Sorry. I've seen you in here. Always lugging that case around.  Whatja sell?
You must travel a lot, huh?
Whole country or just hereabouts?
About your being away all the time. Must get lonely.
Why me? What do you want from me!?
What are you doing?
Just step outside, sir. Now. Keep your hands where I can see them.
This better be important.
Then why do I still have a badge?
You suspected all along, suspected he was alive. That's why you came to El Paso.
How long ago?
An oversight, sir, I apologize. I felt I needed to get away for a day. The pressure. Paid for my own ticket.
I need to get to Amarillo immediately.
I can't. The chat room isn't open for another five days.
There's a killer out there -- we know who he is. He could be stalking now.
Suspect Zero, now there's an idea that doesn't look good on paper --
They sort of got me on shit detail, no offense.
The Academy, then CIIAC.
This is no random killing, no one shot deal. The UNSUB has killed before; he's good at it. So what do we have?  We have someone who has killed before who kills someone who kills: a serial killer of a serial killer -- and who wants the FBI to know he exists.
It explains a lot.
The man knew how to dress.
I was going to be a physician, I am a physician, but I kept drifting over to criminal psych. This seems to be the best of both. My parents still haven't forgiven me.
Sex.
Grown man dressed like a clown. Does he really think he looks good?
I was thinking, maybe we should ask Professor Daitz. Nobody knows this stuff better.
I know.
Does Koessler ask about me?
What did you tell him?
No, Jaime, I apologize. I didn't... I had no right to speak to you like that.
You did.
Not the way I can.
Jaime? Where are you?
I guess I'm a little paranoid.
Koessler doesn't know any of this?
It's too late for that. I've gone ahead of the curve on this one. There's no turning back. When this is over, Koessler is going to be right or Low is going to be right or I'm going to be right, but not all of us.
Could be a lot of things. Depends on the freezer.  I'm sorry, Mack, but I don't think this is the answer.
Hardly anyone calls me Tom. Everybody calls me Mack. I always liked that.
Yeah, of course.
How are we going to find him?
No weapon.
I'll be back.
I believe it is you, sir, who has us jumping through hoops.
I'm not sure, exactly. I had monsters on the brain. I wanted to get these guys, every one of them. I got obsessive.
Deputy Director Koessler opposed the theory because it meant pressing the legal envelope, risking high-profile failure. Better to get rid of me. Then he could be Mr. Serial Killer, Mr. Authority on Deviant Behavior -- no embarrassing questions about the contribution of one Richard Low. Do you really think that plane crashed by accident? Do you really think I wasn't on it by accident? I've always had a good sense of intuition.
Zero killed them all?
Whatever happened to MyDick?
Something came up, Murman, my man.
Lead the way, Murman.
Let's go someplace private, Murman, I have something for you.
[You tell me.]
[And I want to go back to Needlepoint.]
[I don't think so. We want the same thing. See ya.]
What did you do to end up here?
Sounds like fun.
I wished to be reinstated at Computer Crimes. I was undiplomatic in my request.
This case has sent bells and alarms ringing all the way to Washington. Your old boss is coming out.
He wants us to know he's out there, what he's doing. It's not enough just to kill somebody like Speck, he wants us to know he did it.
What is it exactly I don't understand, Agent Mackelway?
I know, I know.
Enough. I've got to use the phone.
What do you drive?
I know! Starbucks! I served you an espresso at Starbucks.
Yes! Remember? You asked me for an application? I introduced you to the manager?
Yes. Like the quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
What else...? Let's see... You have complete freedom.
Uh, if the guy wants to.
No, man. I know you didn't get it 'cause you wouldn't've asked me. It wasn't that funny anyway...
...and even then...
What an asshole.
Don't worry. He's in good hands.
I believe it too. He really just wants her to be happy.
No thanks. Why ruin a perfect night.
Uh, I don't want to bet it all.
There are different circuits... it's hard to explain... you wouldn't understand...
Actually, it's funny you... I'm actually, uh, between...
I know, but she did. She's with someone else now...
We were a rebound, and we lasted six years.
If and when I get a real gig I'll call you.
...The red piece of shit over there...
...get the hell outta here already...
Hi, Mike?
...Six months.
Yeah?
What kind of things?
I thought you met someone else.
Really?
I heard you might be moving back...
Right.
Thanks. Thanks, man.
What do you want? You're tall.
Well, until now. Tend the pin.
I shouldn't, Mike, it's a weeknight.
I don't know. Eight or Nine.
What'd you get?
Looks like we're in a dead heat after one hole. This is turning into quite a rivalry.
Classy.
Bud.
I know. It's like the opposite of inbreeding. The hottest one percent from around the world migrate to this gene pool.
Ah, there's the rub...
..."A Boy Named Sue". I think that's why he's such a bad cat.
Because you left, man. She's got her own world to deal with in New York. She was a sweet girl but fuck her. You gotta move on. You gotta let go of the past. The future is so beautiful. Every day is so sunny out here. It's like Manifest Destiny man. I mean, we made it. What's past is prologue. That which does not kill us makes us stronger. All that shit. You'll get over it.
Sometimes is still hurts. You know how it is, man. I mean, each day you think about it less and less. And then one day you wake up and you don't think of it at all, and you almost miss that feeling. It's kinda weird. You miss the pain because it was part of your life for so long. And the, boom, something reminds you of her, and you just smile that bittersweet smile.
You always know the right thing to say.
So, what? Eleven?
...People get carjacked...
...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679... 
I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry.  This is Mike. 
Hang on, Voltaire.
I know. Daddy's gonna get the Rainman suite. Vegas, baby. We're going to Vegas!
Whu?
Baby, there are beautiful babies here.
She smiled baby.
I'm telling you, they love that shit.
What? You think she's gonna tell her pit-boss on us?
I'm just saying, not in this particular case.
Yea, how much?
Let's go.
That was money. Tell me that wasn't money.
Leave? The honey-baby's bringing us some cocktails.
Baby, did you hear her? "You shouldn't leave without getting something for free." She wants to party, baby.
It's not. You're money. Any of these ladies would be lucky to pull a cat like you.
...gotta...
What?
You didn't have to get into it, baby.
I didn't even like her, to be honest.
Baby, you're so money you don't even know it.
Michelle went for you, right.
Baby, she's the one who should be thinking about you. Sounds to me like you cut loose some dead weight. Trust me, Mikey, you're better off.
Aww... He got away?
It starts at eight...
I don't know. It was kind of a dick move if you ask me.
No, baby!
A day.
Oh. He's got it under control...
...It's on.
No! She's not looking at you. She hasn't looked at you once. Will you stop asking if... Wait, she just looked.
True.
You're like this big bear with claws and fangs...
Now go over there and get those digits.
Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
...it's on.
...it's definitely on.
Yeah. You probably coulda hit that tonight if you didn't have to drive us home.
Two vodka martinis, straight up, shaken not stirred, very dry, easy on the water.
Yes. 
I ask for Justice.
America has been good to me...
Good.  From me you'll get Justice.
Ba Fa Goulle.
No, just you and Paulie.
You won't see Paulie anymore.  He's sick for good this winter.
We gotta move...
Sure.
Drive while you thinking; I wanna get to the City this month!
OK, go to Arthur Avenue; I'm suppose to call when I found somethin'.
Maybe, or you gotta know now.
It's too late.  All the contracts have been signed, they're almost ready to shoot.
You understand him better than anyone.
Mention it, don't insist.  Barzini is a man who will know that without being told.
Tattaglia is a pimp.  He could never have outfought Santino.  But I wasn't sure until this day.  No, it was Barzini all along.
Maybe I can help.
For bravery.
I'll need him.
Yes.
Tom, what we need is an Act of Congress to allow Enzo to become a citizen.
Michael, why must you do this.  We have been lucky so far, all these months you've been here we've kept your name a secret.  It is from love for your father that I've asked you never to more than an hour from the Villa.
Where are you going?
There is nothing there.  Not anymore.
Bad news from America.  Your brother, Santino.  He has been killed.
Only the son of a Pezzonovanta.
Shhhhh.
You look good, too.
Come here a minute, Fredo.
Okay.  One minute.
The cops have it locked in and I got my people there visiting Pop all the time.  What about the hit list.
Without your father's political contacts and personal influence, the Corleone family loses half its strength.  Without your father, the other New York families might wind up supporting Sollozzo, and the Tattaglias just to make sure there isn't a long destructive war.  The old days are over, this is 1946; nobody wants bloodshed anymore.  If your father dies...make the deal, Sonny.
We put out a lot of material through our contacts in the Newspapers...about McCluskey's being tied up with Sollozzo in the Drug Rackets...things are starting to loosen up.
Mama, no.
Thanks Tom.
Not so perfectly if you noticed.
Because they know that no Sicilian will refuse a request on his daughter's wedding day.
Michael, I love you.
How do you do.
My brother Sonny found him living in the streets when he was a kid, so my father took him in.  He's a good lawyer.
No.
My parents don't read the Daily News.  All right, if you think I shouldn't.  I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
I'm busy.
Don't ask me.
Jesus Christ, he's my father, Sonny.
You're right, kid, Clemenza is okay. It was Paulie.
Thanks.
You took Freddie in because the Corleone family bankrolled your casino.  You and the Corleone family are evened out.  This is for business; name your price.
You son of a bitch, you think you can brush me off like that?  I made my bones when you were going out with cheerleaders.
Everybody should have one talent.  What's yours?
Meet my father, Herbert Richard Greenleaf 1st.
Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye.
Did you speak to my father?
Stop! It's too much! You're making all the hairs on my neck stand up!
Marge! You've got to hear this!
No, I think your mother, her illness --
What time is it?  Oh God! Do you always type your letters?  That should be two Ts.
Sure. I love Venice.
A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
No!
I don't know! Why are you asking me?  How can it take an hour to find an ambulance?
Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I?
I knew it! I had a bet with Marge!
Do you even like jazz -- or was that something for my benefit?
I love Marge.
What evening?
I don't think so. Come back with me to Rome. There's this great new club. Have some drinks, lotta ladies...
Far cry from New York.
Marge, good morning. Unusual weather.
He's being thorough, that's all. I'm learning about my son, Tom, now he's missing. I'm learning a great deal about him. I hope you can fill in some more blanks for me. Marge has been good enough to do that, about Mongibello.
I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you.
Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
I'm sure we've met.
Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron.
Frances?
What does that mean?
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
No.  Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
Really? That's swell. No, I was just -- you're way ahead of me! Great!
No, well go if you want to, but don't talk to the Police about my face -- they find out he hit me -- he's got a temper -- he could've hit Freddie.  Good luck, Marge. I'll catch up with you later.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
He's having an early night.
Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
What are you going to do now, Tom?
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
No glasses.
I don't know her.  He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
Excuse me?
As in the...?
Randall.
What?
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months. No, I'm alone. 
But the point is Dickie -- well we know this -- Dickie loves Marge and he misses her and apparently he's come to his senses...
Don't be daft. It's fine. I'm delighted you finally made it to Venice. I'm delighted, contrary to rumour, you're still in one piece?
What do you mean? They're sending someone from Rome?
Whatever you do, however terrible, however hurtful -- it all makes sense, doesn't it? Inside your head. You never meet anybody who thinks they're a bad person or that they're cruel.
You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay?
It's okay.
All kinds of things. Making plans.
I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
Peter, I... I...
You have the key. Tell me some good things about Tom Ripley. Don't get up. Just tell me some nice things.
Postmortem?
Of course. What happened to your face?
Even your fiancée...?
May I ask... why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancée?
I want a .32. Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there.
You can't carry in a cab even with a permit -- so why bother?
Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle.
Yes, mam.
It's just to the corner, mam. In broad daytime. Nothing can happen. I'll be there to protect you.
I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm gonna get organezizied"
I can believe that.
Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much.
I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know.
I shut the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't going to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him.
Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out.
No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks.
Well, no... not really... had some famous people in the cab.  I got this guy who makes lasers. Not regular lasers, not the big kind. Little lasers, pocket sized, small enough to clip your belt like a transistor radio, like a gun, you know. Like a ray gun. Zap.
I work a single, which means there's no replacement -- no second man on the cab. Six to six, sometimes eight. Seventy-two hours a week.
Sometimes 76 or 80. Sometimes I squeeze a few more hours in the morning. Eighty miles a day, a hundred miles a night.
What?
I'm no pusher, Betsy. Honest. I never have pushed.
Yeah. Yes. I don't follow music too much.
Yeah, well my stereo player is broke. But I'm sure the record is OK.
No.  I thought maybe you could play it for me on your player.
Oh, I got over that. It was nothing, really. The papers always blow these things up.  A little stiffness. That'll go away. I just sleep more, that's all.
Thank you, Travis.
The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that?
Have you been noticing anything strange?
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
You sure he's not Italian?
Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
Show me how he did that again.
Awh, come off it, Pal.
What did you do?
One-Ball McCall?
And the kid says, "Yeah. She's about 19, good-lookin." McCall says, "What can I tell you?"
No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
In the jungle. 122nd.
All right.  You see that guy over there?  His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
I don't like my real name.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
Oh, come off it, man.
I can leave anytime I want.
That's not hard to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
I don't know. Just should, though.  Somebody should kill 'em. Nobody'd miss 'em.
I'm sorry, Iris. I didn't mean that.
I can't. Otherwise, I would.
Thank you, sir. You're a good man, sir.
No Sir.
We hire a lot of moonlighters here.
Well then check back tomorrow.
Why do you ask?
Great, hey. Thanks a lot.
I'm no cop.  I want some action.
Shit.
Well, if you are, it's entrapment already.
Funny, you don't look hip. 
That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard.
Yeah. Sorry, Wizard.
Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed?  Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years.
You're not wimping out on us, Goodspeed.
Don't let him do that.
Name your vacation spot, Goodspeed. The Bureau'll pay for it.
You suppose?
Where is he sir?  RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.  What's he doing?  HE'S ON THE= PHONE.  I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, HIS STOCKBROKER! Oh shit.  Gotta go.
It's all I could think of.
It's about time.
Partners.
What's that?  Mason?
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...  You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
I am, too.
I wish you were coming with me.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
That always used to work.
You mean,  me?
I've seen you before.  Your picture...
You look... different.
How'd they get it inside?
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Oh...
What?
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
Have you got a cigarette?
I don't smoke?
Oh.
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
Nope.  Just filling in the blanks.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Good.  Good.  Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Start with what you knew then.
I'm not refuting anything.
I do.
I... I need a drink of water.
What's that?
Thanks.
Can't wait.
Oh.  What... what time is it?
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
They're...
Oh, no, I...
Dad, I...
Six-thirty.  I thought we'd get an early start.
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Pete, if J. Edgar Hoover walked in here wearing a dress, I wouldn't know him.
You should watch what you say.  You don't know who's listening.
Pete...
No, sir.
Call me... Ishmael?
What's his rent?
At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
Yeah, well, that's enough.
What do you mean?
Thanks.
Oh...
Actually, my grandpap.  But "ancestors" sounds better, don't it?  Here.
You look familiar, fella.  What's your name?
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
Just listen to them!
I don't think your mother would like that.
I don't know yet.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie. 
Shhh. Shhhhh.
That's where the Brenners live.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
It's nothing.
Birds are not bad!
No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said.
I had to acknowledge a delivery.  Mother, I'd like you to meet...
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
I'm simply quoting the law.
I told you. We met yesterday.
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
I know, Mother.
Mother?
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Oh, my God, look at her!
You're doing fine.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Yes.
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
I don't mind, really.
We know what it is, Al.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Yes.
Bodega Bay. He goes up there every weekend.
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
The sign says strawberry finches.
Those are canaries, Miss.  Doesn't this make you feel awful?
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
How can you tell?
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
Yes.
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
I wrote the letter.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
Yes.
Cheers.
What do you do?
I'm glad you do.
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
Inland.
Maybe.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
Mitch...
You said three o'clock.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. 
Do you have any lovebirds?
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
I thought not. Birds have been on this planet since archaeopteryx, Miss Daniels; a hundred and twenty million years ago!
No one called it a war!
I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between...
No one ever said you were, Mitch.
I'm not sure, but...
Georgina told me how kind you were to her.  It gave me hope you might intercede for us with Dr. MacFarlane.
Yes.
Good morning, Mr. Fettes.
But that's long since.  Gray can't threaten him with that.
MacFarlane
Where can I find him?
From the Municipal Council -- they're the bodies of paupers --
Not if I have to be party to things like that, Dr. MacFarlane.
You're a man of the world, Fettes, you wouldn't hold me to promise given in drink.
Look here, Fettes.  Not I nor anyone else knows enough about the spinal column and its intricacies to insure success in such an operation.  I would have to study the matter.  Have we any "subjects"?
Grave robbing is one thing -- this is murder.
Wait, Doctor -- wait!  The child's fainting.
He has his own idea of a joke. Perhaps his horse tickled him in the ribs.
A burial party -- poor people -- it's hard to bury a loved one on a rainy day when the churchyard is so cold and lonely.
It was a woman when we put her in.
He was a nice horse.
Don't call me that confounded name.
Medicine?  That'll keep.  Sit down.
Afraid of what?
I am the best man for the job.
You're uncommon friendly tonight, Toddy. More like the old days.
The nerve centers -- the brain --
Because it would be a hurt to me to see you no more, Toddy. You're a pleasure to me.
I know --
We could do that. But when he had them there, then what?
I'll show you how it was done, Joseph. -- I'll show you how they "Burked" them.
No, Doctor.  She seemed to get better, then about six months later she began to complain of pain in her back --
You can get out.
I'll get him.
Tell her... we'll get him.
You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.
There's no scar. Corvis made it up.
The scar.
How can you die if you're already dead?
And another one. There. Erlich. Took a wrong turn.
I'm not hiding. I'm right here.
... is that I sent them here. I told them she came here sometimes. With her dirtball boyfriend. That's exactly what I said.
Yes I do, I really do.
My father.
It's not. I can't take it.
I know.
Some hooker phoned it in. There was a riot at his apartment yesterday.
Good for you. You do know something.
Could say that.
She was eighteen years old! There were four of them. They stabbed her fifty three times! Where's the fucking accident?! Huh?! Where is it?!
I want you... to bend over.
Erin. I know you think she's been talking to you.
The cop who found the knife in Corvis's car.
He said he'd prove it.
Looks like you have them both on.
It's not what you think.
Erin. It wasn't supposed to happen.
About you.
My name is Klaatu.  I spent two days at your Walter Reed Hospital. Room 309. My doctor's name was Major White -- and I had a very attractive nurse called Ruth, who's getting married next Wednesday.  If you are not interested -- or if you intend to turn me over to your Army -- we needn't waste any more time.
We scientists understand this. Even we primitive scientists.  What exactly is the nature of your mission, Mr. Klaatu?
I come to you as a last resort -- and I confess that my patience is wearing thin.  Must I take drastic action in order to get a hearing?
I assure you such power exists.
Hello, darling.  Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Gee, why, Mom? He's my best friend... And he's awful good in arithmetic. He even helps Professor Barnhardt.
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it.  'Night, darling.
No, I haven't, Mom. I promise you... I saw it!
No -- I'm afraid not.
He lives here in Washington, doesn't he?
Where is that?
Yes -- I think so.
Gee! How could they make a landing?
I don't know, Bobby. I'm inclined to doubt it.
Velocity is the time rate of change of position.
It's a problem in celestial mechanics.
All right.
Why not, Bobby?
We'll finish it tomorrow... Goodnight, Bobby.
Thanks, Mr. Carpenter.
Yeah -- sure.  It's a real Boy Scout flashlight.
Why -- the light in my room went out.  Thank you, Bobby. Goodnight.
Their life expectancy is a hundred and thirty.
He says their medicine is that much more advanced.  He was very nice about it. But he made me feel like a third-class witch doctor.
I'm afraid, in the present situation you'll have to learn to think that way.
This is not a personal matter, Mr. Harley. It concerns all the people on your planet.
I traveled 250 million miles. What about your United Nations?
Under the circumstances I'm afraid that will be impossible.
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
I don't care about the rest of the world!
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Where is the meeting going to be?
How long will I live?  That no one can say.
He'll catch on to it in no time now.
No -- I'm afraid not.
They would have killed this man?
How long will that take?
Get going, will you, Brady -- before I get mad!
We don't ride with vampires.
El Vampiro.
I've only got one question for you, and I want an honest answer.  Have you taken any human victims yet?
We unraveled in the face of the enemy!
Why?  They're only noodles.
What's goin' on, Marko?
Hey, take it easy.
Yeah.
Sorry, Michael.  No hard feelings, huh?  Here.  Try these noodles.
That is very probable.  What's your reasoning?
What?
Your dog knows flesh-eaters when he smells 'em!
Closet monster!?
Did we have a date tonight?
I better get cleaned up, then.
Bring your own wheels tomorrow night and you can stay as long as you want... well 'til eleven thirty maybe.
Smells like something died.
Okay.  Have you been eating pizza?  You smell like garlic.
No, no... there's plenty for everybody... Oh, Max, this is Sam... and the Frog Brothers...
-- I'm not talking about Max!  To hell with Max!
Mom!
Ohm I would have been... one marriage ago.
I hear this is the decade for cute.
Boy!  <u>Somebody</u> areound here sure has bad breath!
Our batting average isn't very good is it?  So far we're zero for two.
I hope so.
No, no.  Just worrying about my boys -- as usual.
I thought you said they needed discipline?
Okay.
Don't be a baby.  That didn't hurt and you know it.
Take laddie.
So do I!
Hey, Sam, we're flat broke.
Wanna change my hair, my clothes, my face.
Nowhere.
Don't you have something better to do than follow me around all night?
Mom, just give me five more minutes. Just five minutes, okay?
Piss off.
Don't turn on the light.
Look at your reflection in the mirror!!
I don't know, Michael.  This is not like breaking a lamp or getting a 'D'.
I don't know.
And the horse you rode in on. Sixteen for how long?!  You can't predict this time of year...
I just can't comprehend any of this. It was just a dog.
If the weather clears enough before we reach anybody -- I'm sending you and Doc up to MacMurdo...
Nobody's getting in here.  You can tell them all that!
I don't know who to trust.
Now who'd go and do...
Let go of me...
Was dark... find a light...
I'm working it!  Nothing's happening!
Clark, you want me to come in after you?!
Look, I'm just guessing...
I just can't believe this voodoo bullshit.  You believe this voodoo bullshit, Blair?
That's good enough.
But...
What for?
I think so.
I'm a real light sleeper, Childs...
Nothing we can do about that.
And if it got to Clark... Clark could have gotten to anybody.
Well, stick to it.
No.
Damn if I won't.
Thought you'd feel that way, Garry. You were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...  ... we'll do you last...
Blair.  He's gone berserk.
It'll come.  It needs us.  We're the only thing left to imitate...  Give me a hand.
Couldn't be possible.  Must have weighted a ton and a half...
Bullshit!  He's got to know damn well I cut it!
The generator!
So what do you make of it?
Who else could have used that key?
Hear what?
Can't hear you.
Don't tell me you're a mud carrier.
We're not supposed to think about it.  But I dream about it sometimes...
I am called Vox...  ... Now you are Eloi.
Can you show us where they live?
What?
It was meant to.
This way.
The Morlocks didn't build this.
End...?
Yes.  Initiative and daring are not desirable traits in the Eloi.  But you should be happy for her.  She won't remember the creature she was.  She will... become.
A man can change his history.
I -- what are you?!
Got here as soon as I could.
I mean... well... affection.
And what do you propose, Professor? Shall we hold a seminar to study the problem?
I need... to talk to you.
Not here... alone.  Please.
No... let's walk through the city.
Shhh.  Let's just hurry on here. We don't have to talk, all right?
The sailor's omen of good fortune. The hunter watching over him on his travels.
I've seen it.
Let them.
Tonight's the night?
I want my students to emerge with theoretical and practical knowledge.
That's how I knew we were destined to be together.  When I met her parents for the first time I came right from class and I was covered in chalk.  They sniffed and snorted, but she just smiled.  At that moment -- I just knew.  How did you know with Molly?
You're dying here.  Don't you see that?!
I don't understand.
Yes...
Mm.
You're not from beyond the valley.
Allowed me to travel from my time to yours.
Just a dream.  You should sleep too.  You're still not well.
You can see so many here.
And you saw a shape ahead of you...
Thank you.
You lost someone.
Mara...?
Ouch -- all right, wish me luck.
Tell him to go away --
May I get you some --
Exactly correct, sir.
No, Dr. Hartdegen, they are not just chickens and roosters.  They are science.  Perhaps they aren't "inspiring" to you.  Perhaps they don't "challenge" you --
Abstract mathematics, relativity of dimensions, geometrical "durations" -- even allowing for the uses of speculation, what is the point?
I took a different route.
New Yorkers.
That's quite enough, Kalen.
I am.  Are you a climber?
They're here!  They're inside the house -- !
Must be all the exercise I get scampering up and down these stairs like a wee lamb.
For our sake, I hope not.
Should we be what? Trying to change him any way we can? [Beat] Yes.
Depends on what you're seeing.
In where?
That wasn't a fucking restraint.
Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
My business?
You in here. [Beat] Works like a drug.
I think you know. Your eyes say you do.
I didn't kill myself. I died from a blow to the head. How'd it happen? I have to know.
No, we were patients.
He didn't either.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
I am. One of the few things I remember doing is eating. So I guess I must be exercising it off in my dreams.
His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
Yeah, but I don't know what.
Hey, can you reach the gas pedal?
William Starks. [Beat] Thanks.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
Yeah.
What?
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
They're not.
There're no cars on this street.
[Beat] I don't know.
William, you're not making sense.
No, he didn't.
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
It's complicated, but [looking at Starks] in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
I see you've done your homework. [Beat] Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. [Beat] Now, we do. And things are different.
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
It doesn't look all that different.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
You still don't believe me, do you?
Who told you this?
Yeah, guess so. How'd you know?
Or just plain stupid. You'd think by the twentieth time, I'd have found an alternative method. Maybe a more effective one, if you know what I mean.
[Gravely] No, I mean in four days, I'm supposed to die.
I doubt it. [Beat] I don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...
Sure.
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Nothing. [Getting up] Thanks for bringing me this far.
I'll manage.
You remember it?
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. [Beat] And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
What.
No, Thelma, I don't give a shit what we have for dinner.  I may not even make it home for dinner.  You know how Fridays are.
Yes, baby?
I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
I don't know, honey.  I guess it would depend.
In the leg.
Has anybody asked his wife?  She's the one I hope did it.
You're still with us though.  You're somewhere on the face of the earth?
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
Is there any reason to believe they've left the state?
It's him.
A .38.
He's got nothin' to gain by lyin'.  Nothin' at all.  He already got all their money.  I just don't know what we're dealin' with here. Anyway, it went out again last night on Nationwide Teletype.  Let's just wait it out a little longer.  She said she was gonna call back.  Let's just sit tight.
It's okay.  He is an asshole.  Most of the time I just let it slide.
Thelma?  It's me.
Wait...!  Um, where ya going?
I don't know.  Nothin'.  Took a shower.
I'm a robber.
Oh my God!  Jimmy!  You... Oh my God!  What are you doin' here?
Why now, Jimmy?
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father?  It's just two days.  For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child.  Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud.  Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
Okay.  I will, too.
How come he let you go?
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Isn't this fun?
Tell me somethin'.  Is this my vacation or isn't it?  I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
Yeah!
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine.  Asshole.
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Get the car.
Tell them what?!  What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma!  Who's gonna believe that?!  We just don't live in that kind of world.  Pull over!
So this is all my fault, is it.
What?  Oh, I don't know.  Let me look.
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Why are you actin' like this?
Oklahoma City.  Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
I don't want to go that way.  Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Nothing.  I'm not gonna tell him a thing.  The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
Nothing.  It got messed up.
Lemme see the map.
Oooooweee!!  You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
Try to.
Yeah.
You're right.
Yeah.
Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you?
Harlan.
About how fast was I going?
I believe you.
Just asking.
It's good.  It's what the pioneers ate.
That guy was hurtin' me.  And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse.  And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night.  And they woulda made out like I asked for it.  And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now.  At least now I'm havin' fun.  And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me.  And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise.  Thank you for savin' my ass.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back.  I mean, I just couldn't live...
You could call it that.  My eyes are open.
We can change our names.
You're drivin'.
It's him.  He's got California plates.  It's the same guy.
Yeah, right.  We're not gonna get caught.
Oh.
You too, sweetie, the best.
How do you stay so positive?
Where?!
Go?
Yeah.  I been seein' you, too.
You got that right.
Grrrreat!
Fresno.
The thing's kind of heavy.
No, I just meant...
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
You sent that?
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Never?
I don't know.
I did try calling her.  A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
They told me they don't help out stalkers.  Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Pipes? What are you talking about?
I'm usually too tired to be.
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Out getting coffee.
Big guy -- goes to Barrington high school.
'That right?
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
I'm doing okay.  I gotta get ready for work.
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
You found my car?!
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
Dumbshit.
You own a home there?
Same here again.
Some buildings I'm working on.
That sounds like fun.
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Great.
We will, but first I have a surprise.
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
That...? Vestibule.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Have you seen it?
Well, I'll see ya.
What?
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
Well, I know you're busy...
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
So she hasn't changed?
Huh?
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Kim and I are close friends!
You mean him.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
Who?
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Bingo. Especially since we guarantee you'll get every bit as good a work- out.
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
He's no Steve Young.
Puffy, get over here.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head.  The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
He's dead.
Oh... are you... ?
Thanks.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
No short game.
What are you?
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
You forgot your keys!
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
I think a little of both.
How the hell'd you get the beans all the way up top like that?
No, that's really unneces --
Giddy-up.
We're concerned about the possibility of an incident with an innocent cargo carrier. If it turns ugly, the Russians could use an ugly incident and bad world opinion as leverage to force us to remove the quarantine.
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary, we were not firing on the ship. Firing on a ship means attacking the ship. We were not attacking the ship. We were firing over it.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
So if there are alternatives that make sense -- and I'm not saying there are -- we need 'em. Need 'em fast.
Tonight, listening to Taylor and Acheson, I kept seeing Burke and Dulles telling me all I had to do was sign on the dotted line. The invasion would succeed. Castro would be gone. Just like that. Easy.
We're split down the middle. If I held a vote I think airstrike would beat blockade by a vote or two.
We've got bigger problems right now.
McNamara's on his way back here now. We need to pick the right ship. No subs. No armed boarding parties either. We need a little more time to figure this one out.
He's right. And things are happening too fast. It smells like the Bay of Pigs all over again.
Something your father would've come up with.
-- Jesus, Mary and Joseph. I told you how stupid it was to float the Lippman article! But you wouldn't listen to me. What if there hasn't been a coup at all? What if it's you two who invited that second letter by raising the possibility of a trade?
No, Ken. I need to see him now...
-- You listen to me. Nobody, nobody, talks about my friends that way. You're fucking here right now because of the Kennedys. They may be wrong. They make mistakes. But they're not weak. The weak ones are these 'people' who can't speak their own minds.
We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President.
Still heading for Cuba.
Understood, sir. We need to step up the overflights, finalize our pilots' target folders in order to be able to carry out the strikes.
He was.
Well, you know how Bobby has it in for the State of Mississippi.
Today, for your information, is Pulaski Day. We're going to Buffalo...
Zorin must not have gotten instructions. Somebody in their Foreign Ministry's blown it big-time.
You're sure...
Okay, Ken. We're going.
Of course it is. But the President needs to realize we're going to have to stop a ship eventually.
Listen to me, goddamn it. We're talking about a possible nuclear war. You dropped the ball on Bay of Pigs --
And if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.
Why else would they approach us in this way? It's deniable. The Soviets have done nothing but lie to us. This could be more of the same.
We've worked up several military scenarios. Before I ask General Taylor to lead us through the various options, I'd like for us to adopt a rule. If we are going to strike, we must agree now that we will do it before the missiles become operational. Because once they are, I don't think we can guarantee getting them all before at least some are launched.
Mr. President! We're receiving reports that the ships are stopping!
Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.
Don't have one, Carl. I have a number, man. Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own country, Carl. Shame on you.
Our police are afraid of them. Please get them out of here.
Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to meet a coupla fellas from Denver.
FBI? What you investigatin'?
The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does that old adage still hold true out here?
Leo's been out here too long, man. I'm taking him to ceremonial burial.
No. No, that's Ray, here. Ray, uh...  Ray... Little Weasel.
Good. Thank you.
Goodbye.
His mother needs a piece of his hair. It's for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony.  Has to be kept for four days.
Airborne. That's where they used to get us agents from. Now we get 'em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns.  That's scary shit.
I think Leo's retired from quillwork for the moment.
She talks a lot of shit. We're not doing our job. Jimmy's innocent. "What's the FBI really doing here." Some shit about the Fort Laramie Treaty.
Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an informant?
I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.
Thanks, Cooch.
Well, she's running now, too. These fucking people like to run, don't --
Yes.
Yeah. I... I fell asleep. I can't believe it. I --
We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo, Jimmy... Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is that it?
You're steppin' on sign.
Bullshit.
-- his mother never lived here. She was from up in North Dakota.
Medicine. As in medicine man?
He wants to know if you ever watch the Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted -- a trickster.
Go back to your DNA finger-printin'.
I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.
You want solid? That one, single, print he left in the Badlands -- the one the FBI missed and then stepped all over -- it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man. Jimmy has a serious Ind'n walk -- ball of the foot first. The man who murdered Leo walked like a Wasi'cu.
Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He's gettin' away. Go ahead, go get him. I'm late.
A what?
You ain't no Indian. You're a Sal Mineo Indian.
I can't, Hoss. I don't talk to FBI's.
Crow Horse, listen --
Nowhere. I'm trying to find her.
Sorry.
Yeah. Fitful dreams.
We're standin' on broken treaty ground, Ray. This ain't supposed to be here. It'll poison the water.
What we need... is Richard Yellow Bird.
I know. Come on. We gotta get off the reservation or we're dead.
Wa-shee is like... a dumpling. Like tallow we put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.
Come back?
Yellow Bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a corner. You're playing a losing game. Pull over.
-- yes, Teton Sioux. Father's side.
At Sioux Falls Pen?
I get thrown in solitary until I don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine years if I help you. I helped you!
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
It's classified.
You know. The finger.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
I'm special.
Evan... or Maverick.

You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
Why?
What do you want?
Hardly ever.
How does it go?
True.
Who's gonna win?
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Yes sir!
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
He better be kidding!
These guys are getting on my nerves.
You.
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
Saving them some paperwork.
Not anymore.
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Roger, I've got it.
But I have to!
Any more MiGs?
Oh, no. You did the flying, I'll do the talking!
On what?
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
I've had enough...for now.
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
They should have warned you about that one.
He's a hell of a flyer. In fact, he's so damn good he might have been picked for Top Gun himself. Except for one thing.  He just can't seem to follow orders!
That's because you don't have any women.
SHIT!!
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
So have I.
Three guesses.
What makes you think we can get back in?  We don't have the fuel for this. MAVERICK Just get me to him.
No, really. She came ruined!... Ya think he knows it was me?
Then why are you here?
My wife's house.
I'm nothing like him.
The Last Resort.
Ah, shit.  You got me.  I ain't even married.  Now put your fucking hands in the air!
How'd you find me?
Thank you.
Definitely.
Get your story straight.  This idiot's been trying to kill me since I went to Rekall.  --You don't kill somebody you're trying to plant.
Impossible.  Once the reaction starts, it'll spread to all the turbinium in the planet.  Mars will go into global meltdown.--That's why the aliens never turned it on.
Don't be an idiot.
It's about goddamn time.
Use your head, you dumb bitch!  He's acting out the secret agent role from his Ego Trip!
Hetero.
Sleazy...and demure.
This is going to be very difficult for you at accept, Mr. Quaid.
I'm quite serious.  You're not here, and neither am I.
That's right.
Swallow this.
Any news of Quaid?
This is Richter sir...I've got them pinned down.
O.K., everybody pull out!
We don't have much choice then, do we?
Oh, Rekall.
Don't fuck with your brain, pal.  It ain't worth it.
Harry, you're making a big mistake! You've got me mixed up with somebody else!
I don't blame you man.  I wouldn't want Quaid porkin' my old lady.
I've got Quaid.
Come on!
Drive!  DRIVE!!
Do what?
Lori, move.
I'm late.
Bye.
Some men just tried to kill me!
You went to those brain butchers?!
Doug...
I'm honored.
Come on, don't bullshit me.
Smart move.  Now while you fill out the questionnaire, I'll familiarize you with some of our options.
You're gonna love this. --We offer you a choice of alternate identities during your trip.
Blondes.
Oh, she isn't really your wife.  How stupid of me...She was Hauser's wife.
Kuato's gonna make you remember a few things you knew when you were Hauser.
All sorts of things.  You might even remember you loved me.
Of course not.  If Mars had an atmosphere, he's lose control.
I just has a terrible thought...What is this is all a dream?
No problem.
Breaker there, Earl.  What do you want us to do?
Phone's out.  Road's out.  We're on our own.
Damn!  Val, we can't get them.  Never figured on having to shoot through dirt!  Best goddamn bullet stop there is.  Come back.
I think I scared it!
We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
You're never going to believe this, but the canyon road...we were on it not two hours ago...well, it's completely...
What's under the ground?  We're not getting up on the roof.  Earth shelter's the best.  Known that since I was a kid.
Damn it!  They'll sink this rig just like a boat!
Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our ass every foot of the way, right?
Well, who put you two in charge?
I'd vote for outer space.  No way those are local boys.
Howdy, Rhonda.
Burt and Heather's place is closer. Let's do their kitchen today.  Do Nestor tomorrow.
Nah, it's September.  Must be the new one.
Damn it, Val!  Not having a plan is what keeps us doing jobs like this!
One job I'd never take is working around electricity.
What the hell is going on?  I mean WHAT THE <u>HELL</u> IS GOING ON?!!
Well, there's sure as hell nothing to stop us now.  Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.
Then where's the goddamn Conway Twitty coming from?
Sons of bitches!
Naw, don't want to winch it.  That'd tear it all up.  Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.
First let's see if Stumpy's still out there.
Chuck him out the door!  Like a little hors d'oeuvre.
Just about too damn long.  Bolt pattern's probably wrong anyway.
Doesn't matter.  The cat can pull <u>any</u>thing.
You are so full of shit...
Ran into the new college student, Rona.
Yeah.  One, two, three...
An hour after you picked it up!
I know about Esparza.
Absolutely.
Let go of my hair.
Sustained.
I would like to put Shu's alleged crime in a context, your Honor. And we do have the foremost expert on prison and street gangs right here in this room... If it please the court, I'd like to call Mr. Reynard.
I'm a lawyer. The firm is thinking about renovating. Everything dates back to the Sixties.
-- I don't care who you are. You could've been killed. Every man and woman in here has done hard prison time. And we look out for each other.
Shut your sewer mouth!
I had a minute before the Mapp hearing -- but I couldn't get you on the phone, Eddie...
I can describe it.
I didn't take my eyes off it!
Didn't this "information" come from the Joe Boys themselves -- did they not all but hand you Shu Kai Kim, a Korean, an outsider?
No. No...
Of course.
Look -- I'm tired, I'll see you in the morning, Eddie.
Eight years ago. The Chinatown hit.
Saving it for the Sunday Times.
Roger Baron.
That's why I hate experts.
You know how I know? 'Cause Reynard says he's guilty, and Reynard's full of shit! Look --
That's not gonna happen. I'm gonna create reasonable doubt. Buckle your seatbelt and watch me work.
I'm not that desperate.
Christ... Shu is innocent.
... An hour.  That's why I thought the morgue was on the other side of town.
-- Me? Neither.
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
How can I tell you what I don't know!
When I joined up I took an oath of secrecy. I told you what you needed to know.
See-cil.
I always t-tell the truth.  That's why I'm here.
It's in the area of narcotics, Mr. Reynard, that the government tramples on the Fourth Amendment.
Your client is guilty. Don't dick around with me.
Please don't bullshit me, Mr. Reynard. You've got witness problems, you've got proof problems...
You know you're very tense, Mr. Reynard. Y'oughta take a week off, fly the wife and kids to Oahu.
Objection. The witness is not an expert in racial classification.
Objection.
And who was Arturo Esparza?
I didn't say he was an informant. But since you mentioned it, wasn't Esparza your primary informant?
-- Eddie told you?
Shouldn't one of us...?
-- Why don't you ask Chuckie?
And its purpose?
I'm a soldado in the G-Wing Regiment.
Shu's the only one I know of...
No! They g-got the wrong guy! I saw it! The killer wasn't Chinese.
Blonde.
I want you.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
I want you to kill for me.
I want you to kill for me.
Here he comes.
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
You're lucky I am not wasting you.
We've got our own clock. We'll lock up.
We're taking the body back to Portland and there's not a thing you can do about it.
Teresa Banks had a ring. Any idea what happened to it?
Sam, get the body and put it in the van.  Sheriff Cable, where were you the night Teresa Banks was murdered?
I think I'll take off my badge as well.
COOPER, MEET THE LONG LOST PHILLIP JEFFRIES. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD OF HIM AT THE ACADEMY.
Teresa Banks.
ALBERT, WHY TYLENOL?
Sorry to hear it.
Did she ever mention any friends?
Did you ever see Teresa take cocaine?
Right, which is probably why Lil was wearing a red wig meaning we are headed into a dangerous situation. Let me ask you something, Stanley, did you notice anything about the dress?
Very good, but I can't tell you about that.
He talks loud. And he loves his code.
Gordon would not have sent us to Deer Meadow without thinking it was a high priority situation.
I think that's a good idea.
She's wearing a ring.
He's not the murderer.  But he's a bozo.
When?
I don't know what to do.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
No, you're the muffin.
No.
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
Maybe.
I already made you two tapes.
Hey, Jacques...
What? She asked about my father?
Let's go all the way.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
You mean the ones you pity.
I do love you.  Let's get lost together.
Sex?
They were looking for wood.
Fish eyes?
Sure honey, what's the hurry?
What?
What were you doing in my room?
Mom... what are you wearing?
It's a school night... back by nine.
Good night, sweetheart.
Hyggelig a mote dem. Jeg Heter Leland Palmer.
Not really.
A friend from school.
They don't call them lovers in high school, Leland.
How would you know if Bobby didn't give her that?
Leland leave her alone... She doesn't like that. Stop it.
Oh, I'll sit down, but none of us are going to start eating till Laura goes and washes her hands.
That's right.
Accused. Not indicted. He resigned the firm. Divorced nineteen seventy. Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy- eight. Since then he's been on his own. Four cases before the Circuit Court. He lost them all. He drinks.
All right. But let's keep the price down. I've called Ed Concannon. He recommends that we continue to respond as if we're going to trial.
Yes.
Because it struck me how neatly 'three' went into the amount. Two Hundred Ten Thousand. That would mean I keep seventy.
Yes. It would be.
You've just said you signed it.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.  And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine.  Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
No.
'Methodology and Techniques of Anesthesiology.' Yes.
...almost nine minutes... causing brain damage.
And you would come here, and on a slip of memory four years ago, you'd ruin their lives.
I'll rule on that presently.  Proceed.
When she...
What did these people do when her heart stopped?
Yes.
I doubt we'll have to go to trial...
Hold on a second.
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes. In your opinion is his estimate correct?
Well...
Her doctors murdered her. They gave her the wrong anesthetic and they put her in the hospital for life.  Her doctors murdered her.
I read the file. Yeah. Marx and Towler. I know who they were.
To do right. Isn't that why you're doing it?
Hi. How are you doing?
Yes.
My client can't walk, your Honor.
...things change.
Thank you for seeing me.
That happens.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue. Dr. Thompson. Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
No, no, you listen to me. All I wanted in this case is an even shake. You rushed me into court in five days... my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn. I'm going up there and I'm going to try it. Let the Jury decide. They told me Sweeney he's a hard- ass, he's a defendant's judge. I don't care. I said, the hell with it. The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
And is that what you're going to do?  Is that what you're going to do...?
Do you want me to go...?
Who told you that?
Mr. Alito, please.
...Would you, would you call him up. I'll give you my number, and ask him...
I understand. Thank you, my name is Galvin. I'll be at the following number in a half an hour. It's urgent.
If you're selling something, I'm late for work...
Kathy Price.
My subscription lapsed three years ago...
...you got your doctor's testimony. Why do you need me?
Nothing happened.
And ask me what?
I didn't do it, Mister.
It's locked.
...I understand...
Yeah.
...he's a good man...? He's the Prince of Fuckin' Darkness... he'll have people in there testifying that the broad is well -- they saw her Tuesday on a surfboard at Hyannis... don't fuck with this case.
Admittance form is wrong.
Brindisi versus Electric Boat.
So what...? The best is yet to come. Check the TV Guide. They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
I'm swell.
Come on, we'll get a cup of coffee...
Yes, that's correct.
Yes.
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.  We were trying to restore her...
Wait, wait, wait, you're saying that her brain damage could have been caused by her being deprived of oxygen for two minutes...?
Huh. And why is that?
Huh.
Madrid has just blacked out!! Nothing more coming through.
I'm looking for some Pacific-Tech professors...
There was a girl with them...If I could find her....
Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines.  They had him on the cover of 'Time'.  You've got to rate to get that!
How can you say that when you don't know him!
I didn't know how to stop you...!
Don't you live at home?
I come from a big one.  Nine of us. All in Minnesota, except me.
It does...Maybe that's why I feel kind of lost right now.
But they seem to murder everything that moves...!
I liked him.
But you're not going to.  You're not the kind.  You're tired, anyway.  You've been up all night.  You cracked up in a plane.  Slept in a ditch.  But you want to know something?  It doesn't show on you at all.
Hours.  I've been so scared...!
I couldn't see much in the dark - but it was one!
That's the kind of a kid brother you'd have!
You'll be all right with us....  ...for as long as anybody's got!
It might give us something.
It was nearer than that.
Welcome to California!
Believe it or not, he told me I hadn't heard from him in ten years because he hasn't had any good nightmare.  They're his inspiration.  But now he's got a new script in the works.
He's very excited about it.
What?
You get any sleep last night?
Okay, but it still doesn't mean it can't be over with.
Maybe you should tell me your dream.
Chase. Hi...
What?
Rex?  Who's Rex?
Finish, please!
He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?
Not sleepy.
Your bed?
Can we go get Rex, now?  The bad man's getting awful close.
Read me some?
It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy.  And jumping in...
It's in my family, you know.  My grandmother died in an institution...
Kids know when something's bugging a parent.  You've got no idea who this is calling?
Dylan's run away from the hospital.  I don't know whether he's wandering around or heading for the house.  But I think Freddy's after him.  I know it sounds crazy!
John.  Will you please just look for him around the hospital?  I'm gonna go right to the house.  Will you help me, John?  Please!
No, you don't, ma'am, it's not necessary.
Thanks.  Just give them the time he called.  They're keeping a list, supposedly.  Sorry.  My nerves are so raw these days.
By storytellers, of all things.  Every so often, they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence.  Then it's held prisoner for a while.  In the story.
Choice?  What kind of choice?
And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.  Would you trust him alone with your child?
Your father?
You miss him.
He never would have believed a woman like you existed.
Claiming their place in the world.
Hey!  Weigh!  Blow the man down...
Give me some time to Blow the man down!
Mr. Lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet.  Rick, get on the jib sheet.  George, John, Philip, Tim and Dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse.  George will show you what to do.  Tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. Forecourse first... work upward.
Yes sir.
My instinct was to not get electrocuted.
Butler, what'd I ever do to you?
What do you mean?
No, I can't.
What do you mean?
My old man split along time ago.  It doesn't mean anything.  You just take care of number one that's all that matters.
If you're gonna cheat, you might as well copy off somebody who's gonna get the answer right.
Listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades.  We'll start a private study group.  Nobody knows.  You'll ace that test.
Yeah.  How'd you do.
What was that?
I'll tell you who you are.  You're the glue.  You're the thing that holds everybody around you together. You're strong, you listen and you see things in people the rest of us can't.  It's a gift.
I was just thinking that I never had a new pair of shoes till I was twelve.
Because it looks good.
You don't give him enough credit Chas.
What's the difference?
Yes.
I know you will.
Maybe it's an air raid.
My mother says in this really low, but very awake kind of voice "What?"
Yes sir.
Face what?
Would you, um, say it's a big storm?
So is violating international law.
Twice.
No.
As you can see, there's a lot to do.
It will be more than that, I can promise you.
And, of course, we are.
Why are you here?
Look, you put me on this boat in the first place.  I didn't want to come but I did.  Why do you have to embarrass me.  Why can't you just leave me alone?
They're in a hurry to grow up.  They don't know about consequences or responsibility.  That's being sixteen too.  I promise you one thing...
They'll know about it in the morning.
She's Cuban.
Why'd you jump?
I couldn't do it.
Trust me donut.  I know.
On the dog watch, night after the storm, I look down into the skylight above Skipper's cabin and there she was, peelin' down.
I don't have to listen to this.
Outer.
No.
Excellent.  Bill, find Mr. Weathers a position to suit his condition.
I'm sorry...
Except, a "White Squall".  With all due respect Captain Sheldrake, they're only boys...
Isn't also true that his vessel went down off of Nantucket?  Lost everyone on board.  In fair weather no less.
This be it?
We don't have no paper bags.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Get out.
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
Ready for another?
She really say she was pregnant?
No, of course.
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
Thanks.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
Muchas gracias.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
She's forgiven you of all these things... You love her... Don't be afraid, Sailor.
Certainly not. We are here only briefly, in fact, until this evening, when we fly to Austin, Texas to visit a friend of mine who is an agent for the CIA.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
That bastard Pucinski...
How'll he know what we look like? He seen our photo?
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
And?
Peanut...
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Here she goes again...
That's good... Now go get yourself a beer.  You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
You up for that?
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Got anyplace special in mind?
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
It's just another case, Sailor.
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
We'll find out in a hurry.
Uh huh.
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
That'd be good, Lula.
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
Yeah?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Oughta make 'em happy.
Went with Bobby.
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
Got any plans?
What if I told you not to?
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
That's your business... I don't care how.
Santos...
Shoot him.
No.
No... But...
Santos... I can't...
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
So?
I didn't see nothin'...
Thanks...
Excuse me. Did you, or did you not, have a gun to his head?
Oh, don't be silly. No one your age just wants to go home. Besides, faculty will be present. Just think of it as a field trip.
We're springing you, Leer. Get some pants on.
The candelabras were my Gran's.
He's great. Come on, let's blow before lo' Gran decides to boil your bones for breakfast.
Hhhuh. So we decoy her. Stick a couple pillows and one of your teddy bears under the spread and she won't know the difference.
So I hear.
Ah, right. Well, I gave you my opinion.
I sweat blood for five years and he checks for spelling.
It was Jerry Nathan's. He owed me money.
She left me. Crabs.
This morning. I found a note in the kitchen.
Shut up and drink.
Vernon, then. Vernon Hardapple. The scar's are from a -- from a horse. He fell during a race and got trampled.
He can't piss standing up anymore.
And he had a younger brother who... was... a...
Because... because...
Tripp.
Where would we go?
What? Ohhhh. Is that... it?
Nothing, he's just been sort of, I don't know... kidnapped.
Ye-es?
Only now I'm starting to think the car wasn't exactly Jerry's to give.
No wonder he screwed us over.
Ah. Well. Congratulations. Meanwhile, what is James supposed to do? Pray for Walter Gaskell to come to his?
That's very enlightened, Professor. It's comforting to know that America's children have you for a teacher.
I mean, I was breaking up with this girl at the time and my car was ail fucked up and -- well -- I was pretty bent in general.
I just want you to know that's why I dropped your class and said all that shit about the university stealing my money and you being a pseudo- Faulknerian nobody.
So I hear. You've also been smoking a lot of marijuana, I understand.
Her dog, yes.
They're anxiety attacks? That's a little disappointing.
'Fraid so.
A little.
Heaven?
Like the lady herself.
She is. Ah. Here we go...
No thanks. I'm fine without them.
You're welcome.
I guess there's probably a story behind that.
What'd he say?
Wow, Hannah always swore you were working, but --
Nothing, it's just that, well, it's been awhile since Arsonist's Daughter, and some people -- some of the kids in workshop -- thought maybe you were...
Well done, James.
I never heard of it.
Kinship.
I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning.  Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.
I never said that.
Spells? Jesus, James, you make it sound like we're in a Tennessee Williams play. I don't have spells.
James, like it or not, they're your parents.
That's why she hates me. That's why she makes me sleep in the basement.
Yes, James.
Do?
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
That good, huh?
I got the message you called too.
No. Maybe. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to do.
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
A twelve-year-old policeman came by the house this morning.
Hub? Oh, well, that's part of what I need to...
I'm sort of helping him work through some issues.
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
I think I might have.
I think I might've said I was in love with you.
Oh?
I told Walter.
It didn't come up.
In the hospital. I was kind of excited about it at the time, but then I was on pretty heavy painkillers.
Tony. Now that I'm home.
It's Grady, Walter.
I have... eight-fifteen. That's not right, is it?
Christ, Traxler. How the hell should I know?
Only when I'm working.
As a heart attack.
Well, I'm sure with the proper guidance he'll be fine.
Give me a break, Grady.
Seems like the whole world's gotten younger.
K through sixth.
It's a nice table.
It wasn't like that.
Next week? The week after?
Isn't it?
You don't have to tell me this.
Birds.
In that birch tree is a nest.
Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
Not yet.
Got something to hide?
I could get a search warrant.
They grow outside, don't they?
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
Would you like to sit on my lap?
They sound like finches.
Do you like it when he asks you?
Ms. Kramer.
Your daddy will always love you.
I'm not running for Mr. Popularity.
That was a joke.
Diaries have sent too many guys to prison.
Of course.
I don't need someone else.
If I'm not, then what the hell am I doing here?
You know why. It's part of the parole deal.
We have a lot of work to do.
I couldn't say.
Then go see a therapist who will tell you you're normal!
I want to talk about it now.
Sorry.
Just lying there.  We're taking a nap.
I was six years old!
Are you okay?
I like the noise.
I get that impression.
You're still here.
Maybe later.
I suffer from insomnia.
When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
The worst?
Twelve years in prison is no joke.
You don't really --
No. That's what I used to tell myself.
Well, most people are stupid.  You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
What's it look like?
Nothing.
Piece of cake, baby.
What is that?  You drop your dive light?
Figured I was dead, there, when I seen that angel comin' toward me.
Not even when it meant something.  Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Wow, you're right!  Us poor dumb ol' boys might've had to think for ourselves.  Coulda been a disaster.
Not particularly.  Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
I don't know.  Divorce ain't final.  Forgot to take it off.
Yeah, what's-his-name wouldn't like it.  The Suit.
Bud, why are you doing this?  It's not part of you life any more.
I don't know what I saw.  Okay?  Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine.  It's a Russian submersible.  No problem.
If you say so.  It could be anything.
It's trying to communicate.
They'll come out after us.
How?
Aaargh!!  I'm freezing!
NO!!  Now be logical, Bud, you're--
What's the plan?
Tell me later.
'Course is worked.  You're never wrong, are you? How d'you feel.
Check.  Then I just hang with these guys, right?
Yeah.  The dude's in bad shape... you see his hands?
Got it. Over.
It's his mixture!  Too much oxygen!
Couldn't stay away.  You running mixture for us? Good.  Couldn't ask for better.
Happy as hogs in a waller down there, prob'ly.
Turn it up, bozo.
We've been fully briefed, Mrs. Brigman.
Gimme a break!  Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench!  Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
He couldn't be that dumb.  The guy's a trained killer.  Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
Very good.  About one person in twenty just can't handle it.  They go buggo.  They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
He's hallucinating badly.
To the fact of my retirement, not only as a diplomat but also as a father.
You already know what they are.
It's the same thing. Goodbye, dear.
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to put it that way. But, you must understand, sir, that I...
It takes about twenty to twenty-two hours for the current to reach here from Lisca Bianca.
Well, what?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
No.
But then when will we see each other?
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
And why did you drop them?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
What! Get married?
And aren't you pleased?... That way you'll have a new kind of adventure.
Why?
Sleep is something one must learn to overcome. I learned how to do it when I was a child. I never slept. And I had friends who even slept less than I did. The one who went to bed first, paid a penalty. And we really didn't do anything. After seeing a movie, we'd go to a cafe and discuss things for a while... then we'd sit down on a bench somewhere... listen to some drunkard... watch them putting up posters or manifestoes...or look at the sheep passing by... or go for a stroll around the market place... Or else we'd go and wake up some girl in the neighborhood by standing in front of her window and calling out her name...
It was futile. We went all over.
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
But for what reason should I come there?
But why?... What if it starts to rain?
So... the boat we saw yesterday afternoon might have also been that of these smugglers. Could it be possible, then, that Anna...?
This is Claudia, Anna's friend...  You've never met my husband, have you?
What is it?
And you expect to find him in here? Go and ask Claudia.
Giulia, don't you understand that the more involved you become with people, the more difficult it is to speak with them?
Here I am.
And where do you find the models?
I thought the model was something obsolete nowadays. Didn't you, Claudia?
Yes, sir. My sister is sick... and my father, too.
Now look, my men saw it and they also saw you men throwing those crates overboard. What have you got to say about that?
I tell you this acquaintance of mine knows you and she has often spoken to me about you.
At this time of the year there are so many boats...
I don't see why I should mind.
Good. Then I'll meet you there.
I detest it. But, after all, what can you do... It's the latest...and I try my best to adapt myself.
If women's breasts were colored, yours would be blue...
Who?
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
They were stained.
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened.  I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
I love you.
At least once a week.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
And what did you do?
In the middle of all the pain?
The baby they made up.
Agnes...
I can't have them any more.
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Somebody told her.
You'll laugh.
No.
No, but I can never tell her that.
Because I don't want one.
A mistake...
I'm not sick.
I can't.
Yes.
She touches me down there with a cigarette.  Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good,  I won't be a baby any more.
No I'm not.
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
May I open my eyes now?
I ate.
Of me. Oh... God!  My God...  Water... it's all water...
What did she mean?
Who?
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
Agnes?  Who?  Mother Superior?
Why?
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Thanks...
You got to be crazy.
If I find anything I'll call you.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Shut up, I'm trying to watch this.
No-one.
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
Obviously there was.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
So, someone else could have done it.
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
And what happened?
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God...  ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
There's another choice.
Nothing.
Yes.
What is it?
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
Nothing...
Hand rolled.
For the Church?
How  ?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
That's what you believe she is?  The sum of her psychological parts?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
I didn't guess until it was too late.
... Oh, I'm all heart, Ma'am, all heart ... Well, I let ...
Shurrup!
Well that's lovely talk, that is. And another thing, why aren't you at school?
Yeah? And they're your mates are they?
How about Ding Dong?
And hurry, they're not looking too happy.
Well, that's the wrong line for a start.
You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
I'll have a bash.
I don't care.
Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
It is, y'know.
No, straight up.
He's sulking again.
We do.
He hasn't.
I'll look in here again.
Oh, sorry I spoke.
D'you know something, "They" don't worry me at all. Anyroad, I only fancy listening to you ... that's all but if it worries you ... well ...
Yeah ... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.  Yeah, it's gear on a girl.
Don't mench ... well, why don't you give us a few more lines, like?
No.  I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.
The big hammer?
What of? Look, I wouldn't do it unless I was. I'm dead lucky 'cos I get paid for doing something I love doing.
I only enjoy acting for myself. I hate it when other people are let in.
And you honestly think that's what she meant?
See you.
Yeah ... what's in it for me?
I'm going parading before it's too late!
Nothing good.
Get Lloyd George over there with that mechanic in the cloth cap while I sort this lot out.
Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson ... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!
You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
Aye, come on, honest, that grandfather of yours is worse than any of you lot.
Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.
Nothing, he's trying to brainwash me and give me personality doubts ... oh, he's a swine but a clever swine, mind.
Aw, leave him alone Paul, he's back, isn't he? And it's not his fault he's old.
You're a swine, isn't he George?
Ah, go on, you swine.
We were going to do it.
Well, you shouldn't have had bacon for your breakfast, you cannibal.
What?
I'm not, no.
Well, yes your nose is. Very.
Aah, shurrup, misery!
Well ...
He'll get over it.
Don't exaggerate.
Don't worry about him. He can look after himself.
I can't help it, I'm just taller than you.
Oh, I didn't notice, where'd he go?
Oh, down the ... er ...?
Well, give a couple of minutes ...
You're imagining it. You're letting things prey on your mind.
But John hasn't got any.
Clever.  George.
Oh ... he's nursing a broken heart.
Get knotted!
I'm an electrician, not a wet nurse, y'know.
Oh, anything you say, Paul.
A proper Aborigine.
Kill drive engines.
Nine hundred meters and dropping. 800.  700.  Hang on gentlemen.
Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years.
... I don't know...
Receiving.
No, you'll follow me.
But functioning.
Take a look.
I think that's a pretty reasonable request.
I don't know... I'm getting these <u>CRAMPS</u>!
What?  <u>Why</u>?
Bulbs burned out, nobody bothered to replace 'em.
All over the ship; we'll have to check the charts to know for sure.
Don't know -- maybe we'll be real lucky and he just broke his neck.  I knew we shouldn't of come down here.
Right.
Well... I'm going to have to blow the engines out...
Oh -- I'm not near ready yet.
Right.
Well we better do something.
Meet us on the bridge.  Be careful -- it's <u>huge</u> now.
No, I don't want us separated.
Right. 
<u>He's</u> the only one that knows that.
It wouldn't come.
Well, what the hell good can we do in here?  We can't grab it -- it might jump on us --
How's Broussard?
Good.
Sounds like a rough one.
I'm trying.
The computer just translated the goddamn message.  It's not an S.O.S. It was a warning.
Jay, this is Cleave!  Meet me at the main air lock!
It doesn't make any sense.  It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
I think it's fizzled out.
Hey!  what about the film?
I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
Sun will be down in a minute.
Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
Primitive pictorial languages are based on common objects in the environment, and this can be used as a starting point for translation...
All right, then -- when it gets to the other side of the door, you sing out, then drop the door.  Okay?
Look --
Chaz, I've got something here on my security alert.  A high priority from the computer...
Turn on navigation lights.
Nontoxic... but unbreathable. Pressure?
Good!  Moisture content?
Oh well... you know me.
Good.
You bet we made it.  Martin, set course for Irth and accelerate us into stardrive.
I guess we open the door and net it.
Once we kill the thing we won't need the food any more -- we can go straight into hypersleep.  Also, it sounds like that thing is already doing a pretty good job on our supplies; it may be fouling them all.
Go ahead, Jay.
At least we're rid of the damn monster.  It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed.  And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
What can I do?
Sure.
Well, just keep looking.  It's gotta be... whoa, Jesus!
Bloody big if it is.  Top's open.
Thanks.
Oh man...
Better tell the boss.
Too many.
Keep trying!
Shit.  When?
We ran a trajectory simulation.  If they carry on along that path, it's possible they'll make intra-orbital insertion.
Seven minutes ago, the third course change in an hour.  Those incomings are going to skim past the communications platform just a little too close for comfort.
Match it!
That's what I mean.  This is the quietest I've ever heard it.  It's unnatural.
I've seen this mother, De Vries.  We can bag it, no problem.
Yeah, I...
It's alright, it's cool...
Where does that lead to?
What's the problem?
Give me twenty minutes and I'll do it myself.
Have you got an updated Lloyds' Almanac to cross-reff them through?
Get off an all-bands emergency distress, and put it on a repeater.
Compensate!
What?  Why?
Forget it.  I wouldn't ask somebody to do something I wouldn't do myself.  Where's the disk?
Right.  Auto-shop, you all set?
I just... wanted to be put on my own for a while.  Clear my head.
And before that?
'We'?  You wanna fly out there with me?
Check out the tent.
Alright.  Pull some trackers and headsets out of stores, and I'll sign a release for the weapons.  Cassie, organise a team roster and put it on the board.
Detour.  Other way's blocked...
Don't wait for me!
I... I can't!
No!
You should hit the sack, too.
Give me a yell is something happens.
I call myself Phoebe.
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
It wasn't meant to be.
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
I'm in love with Lloyd!
... and Karen.
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
Everything. Because after tonight, you will belong to me.
What of it?
She never proved anything, not a thing!
I was there, I saw you and heard you through the dressing room door!
Yes, Addison.
Now there's something a girl could make sacrifices for.
You have me confused with Dan Dailey. You go sit by the piano.  And you come sit by me.  Good night.
Why do they always look like unhappy rabbits?
That's all television is, my dear. Nothing but auditions.
As soon as the peasants stop pawing her.
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
Miss Caswell, at the moment, is where I can lend no support - moral or otherwise.
Completely. Nor, I am sure, could anyone else present tell you how Miss Caswell read or whether Miss Caswell read or rode a pogo stick.
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
The air lines have clocks, even if you haven't! I start shooting a week from Monday - Zanuck is impatient, he wants me, he needs me!
Geniuses don't need good luck.  I do.
Thank you so much.
I'm a junk yard.
Real diamonds in a wig. The world we live in...
Huh?
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
Sing it?
I get a party, don't I?
She hasn't missed a week since I left - but you know all that, you probably tell her what to write... anyway, I sent her a list of people to ask - check with her.
How is Eve? Okay?
See you...
She's a girl of so many interests.
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
So full of meaning, fire and music!
I've been aware of that for some time.
But if I tell you it is - as I just did. Were you listening to me?  Isn't that enough?
I think you do know but you won't or can't tell me.  I said before it was going to be my last try, and I meant it. I can't think of anything else to do. I wish I could.  We usually wind up screaming and throwing things as the curtain comes down. Then it comes up again and everything's fine. But not this time.  You know there isn't a playwright in the world who could make me believe this would happen between two adult people. Goodbye, Margo.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
Glory Hallelujah.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
You've got it backwards. Even for Wilkes-Barre.
You know what I'm going to be?
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd.  I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight...  Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
You didn't have to tell me.
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
I'm in love with Margo. Hadn't you heard?
What did you expect - live sables?
Buy some.
You don't have to apologize for me!  I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
Do you want an argument or an answer?
Night an' day.
Like an agent with one client.
My back's open.  Did the extra help get here?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
Miss Harrington...
Probably not.
I might.
You rest. I'll get it...
He's the best.
Eve. Eve Harrington.
I don't let myself think about it, even-  - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl-  - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
No, Eve, I won't forget...
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
I don't intend to be.
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
Let's not get over-dramatic.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
Eve...  ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Really, Eve? Why?
Why not?
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
I'm so happy you're happy.
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
Three or four miles...
It doesn't matter.
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Isn't that what they always say?
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
With tears.
Loud.
Up to here! That's where I've got it - up to here! Of all the star ridden, presumptuous, hysterical-
Then a childish, heavy-handed routine about not knowing Eve was her understudy-
Just a little skid, that's all. This road's like glass.
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Where'd you get all that information?
That was a pity...
I'm trying hard to follow you.
With gestures, of course.
Nothing much. She apologized.
Not much.
Nothing...
I'm a human being, I've got some!
Too many. And you've got a new guest. A movie star from Hollywood.
The play? All right, I guess...
Twentyish. It isn't important.
How do you mean?
Week after week, to thousands of people, you're as young as you want...
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
She was a revelation...
We are ready with your call to Beverly Hills...
We are ready with the call you placed for 12 midnight, California time, to Mr. William Sampson in Beverly Hills...
I just played it.
How about me what?
A couple of weeks.
Would you?
This is real cooperation. I appreciate it.
All you got to do is name it.
Margo, I wouldn't think of taking that girl away from you...
Well...
--it was bullshit the way it was--
--you only got the job because both you and Bradlee went to Yale--
--they're all the same, all those Ivy League places--they teach you about striped ties and suddenly you're smart--
Yeah?
Let me lay a little theory on you--
--a spy, you mean?
We need a sympathetic face.
--see?--
--she was panicked, Carl--every time I mentioned Watergate, you could tell.
Alphabetically, on the CREEP phone list, Miss Helen Abbott of South George Street.
You're not a kid anymore.
We know there's got to be something or they wouldn't be so panicked.
I just wish we knew when someone would talk to us, that's all.
It's safe, try it, you'll see.
And I'm a Republican.
Sure.
Nixon.
Go on, go on--
--we will--
--shit, who do we know?--
--I haven't said anything--
--Haldeman I know, who else?
Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal.  God knows it worked.
Who?
It's nothing personal, though. 
--Deep Throat won't confirm--I never thought he was scared of anyone, but he's scared of Haldeman.
Goddamnit!--
Whatever.
This?  Naw...
Any idea what he did?
They never told me anything except my own role--I had to find out the rest in the papers.
I know where Dwight works.
Chapin did contact you then?
It gets interesting if it was Haldeman, because our word is that when Chapin says something, he's gotten the OK from Haldeman, and when Haldeman says something, he's gotten the OK from the President.
At USC, you had a word the this-- screwing up the opposition you all did it at college and called it ratfucking.  Ever wonder if Nixon might turn out to be the biggest ratfucker of them all?
--that was awhile ago--
Nobody's perfect.  I'm glad you're out of it, Hannah-- you're a terrific reporter and I turned you into a bookkeeper.
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore--  --I think the place is bugged.
And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
I will not talk about the other two.
Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."
And we'll all have to go to work for a living.
--all non-denial denials--we're dirty guys and they doubt we were ever virgins but they don't say the story is inaccurate.
--Christ, I wish I knew if we should print this--
--you double-checked both sources?--
--his dialing finger must be falling off--
Electronic surveillance.
--I'm not here.
I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.  Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
To where?
I know what it means--Segretti wouldn't go on the record, but if he would, we know he'd implicate Chapin. And that would put us inside the White House.
Who?--be specific. How high up?
Did you change cabs?  It didn't work, something moved there--
Yes, yes, everything. There were over fifty people employed by the White House and CREEP to ratfuck-- some of what they did is beyond belief.
The C.I.A.
--I'm Woodward.
I think so.
--nobody gives a shit about the Dahlberg repercussions--
You can't believe that.
Lotsa hints--
Thanks, Harry.  Know anything about Colson?
Hunt is Colson's man--  --that's Charles Colson, Nixon's special counsel--  --they both went to Brown University--  --Hunt worked for the C.I.A. till '70, and this is on deep background, the FBI thinks he's involved with the break-in.
I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
Larry Young, a California lawyer--
My wife told me to expect you.  As you know, I haven't talked to the press.
No. It was closer to seven hundred thousand.
One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
Okay then.  The rest of you okay with that?
Sorry, coach.
Mochaccino.  Actually, in the spirit of the pact, I do need to ask for your cooperation in one small matter.
As if there were any alternative in the matter.  Are you enjoying yourself?
Mister Finch -- are you trying to seduce me?
Yep.
Uh-huh.
Really?  Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
You talked to Stifler?
What?
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
Sure.
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
No, you're stupid.  Get going!  Right now!  She's primed!
Come on, Jim.  Where are you?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure.
Dad, come in.
Oh, no, not too much of a bookworm. He's a good little kid.  Er, guy. Man.
Michelle.
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
I told you.
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Okay!
A <u>hot</u> cartoon.
No -- Kevin, you?
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Oh -- no way.  I can't do that to her.
So do I, Kev.
Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy.  I am now a man.
Perhaps you can help me with my studies?
Move with the music.
Nadia, I can't --
Oh no.
Yes...James, it is knowing that these beautiful women arouse you that arouses me...
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway?  You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you?  Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
You think so?
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Not for you.
How?
Shhhh.  Your parents are downstairs.
You want to do it?
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yeah, right here.
I don't know.  How do you?
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
What?!  How do I do that?
This is different.  This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you.  Someone to keep you motivated.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here.  Now think about it --
Dude, prom sucks.
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
I think we're falling in love.
Dude, he does not.
Keep it down, dude.
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are <u>hot</u>.
No shit.
No way.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says...  An eye for an eye...
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
Yeah. Apparently.
What?
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
A cure?
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Fuck me...
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
Shit!
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
And you call me a moron...
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
Why isn't it doing anything!?
Oh no... no....
What about me?
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
I went to St. Severin church.  Now look -
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.  And what about you?
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
He says -
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
You never heard the story of Saint Severin driving the werewolves from Paris?
I know, but I had to because . . .
I'm not sure but look. . .
But what if we can't ever find where we came from?!
I'm fine.
Who's Sophie?
What happened to your parents?
You know, it's strange - Anastasia's grandmother, the Dowager Empress Tatiana has been looking for Anastasia since the revolution.  Why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?
Perhaps it's because she has amnesia too - can't remember. . .
I was all out of dynamite!
Trying... to... breathe...
No!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
Don't be
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
Oh my God!  Don't do that ... feel my heart. Go ahead. I'm dying here ...
Would you have leaned over Rembrant's shoulder and told him to paint faster?
"Wake up, your highness" - we should start getting used to saying it.
Pray he's color-blind...
She found her home. Maybe it's time I found one too!
STOP IT! I DID SO KILL THEM! And I'm going to kill Anastasia.
What I <U>found</U>your was your granddaughter!
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
Who are you?
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
How can you possibly oversleep?
What-what-what-what's the matter?
M'm.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
Yeah, I know.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
M'hm...
Neat, yeah.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't  No kidding?  this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
Yeah.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
Yeah?
M'hm.
You are extremely sexy.
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
Do I love you?
Yeah.
Mine.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
Well, have you ever made love high?
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Yeah?
Whatta you mean? Me?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
Oh.
No.
Yeah.
Yeah?
It's for my complexion.
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
Thing?
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Why are you so hostile?
Don't get upset!
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
My head is throbbing.
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
I'm a Rosicrucian myself.
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know,  I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
What are you depressed about?
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Hey.
May I see your license, please?
Since you put it that way.  It's hard for me to refuse.  ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Max, I've got a hit series.
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
Yeah, intensive care ward.  My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
She was stealing.
How can we afford it? On your pay? What if she steals more?
Then there was Jerry, the actor.
Hey, listen-I mean, he was a terrific actor, and look at him, he's neat- looking and he was emotional... Y- hey, I don't think you like emotion too much.
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Hey-
I was a great beauty.
I was very charming.
A long time.
And you've only just met.
The camera loves her.  A great actress.
Leo?
How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious.  You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute.
Of course.
Don't you miss it?
So this sitter can always reach me.  I'm still not used to leaving him.
Oh my God, the sitter.
Yeah.
Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight.
I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months.
Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked.
I love you, Joe Therrian.
Leave us alone right now.
We live next door.
You're crazy baby.  I love you.
Hm.  You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
Fantastic.  Out here.
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Did you invite them?
Just do what I say, alright?
Beats a lawsuit.
I'm ready.
Ryan's novel.
Hardly...
They can't find a sitter...  Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on.  Just a moment.  It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
Really?
Who'd like to go and find Otis?
It's alright.  Be our guests.
You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers.
I'm worried about my spine.  I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate.
Otis!!!!
Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect!
Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy.
Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally.
Sally, for Christ's sake.
You changed your mind.
You're not ready.
I guess.
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally.
It's very good.  I understand you won the Booker Prize.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Yes I know.  I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac?
Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux.  I see you've moved up from the soft stuff.
No you're not.
Hm.
What?
Elitism?
And you know, he really does not.
Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
You're never too old for a lolly.  I'm having one.
Lemon.
And he doesn't smoke?
I'm sure you understand.
I'm not going to leave you alone.
Why?
Don't go in, Ryan.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash.  Oh my God.  You're my icon.  I've been watching your films since I was a little girl.  Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
Thank you.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
You see, that's worse.
Like your business managers?
Oh, okay, forgive me.  Your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.
"How are you really doing, Panes?" "Lousy, thank you, I'm falling apart."
No.  No, not like the last time.  She was the rest of my life.
I didn't hear me say tonight.
I'm Levi Panes.  Will you excuse us, Skye?  It's time for Sally's meds.
Oh you know.  No doubts.  No second thoughts.  Am I a monster?
That's not an answer, is it?
I guess.
At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape.
It's just very distracting when you're trying to work.
Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself.
Rose.
Whatever, do you remember?  I've seen all your movies.  When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie.  They said you were too real.  I worship you.  And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
And here they are!
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
You weren't exactly horrified.
Neither does Joe.
Why are you doing this?
Invisible!
I work in the palace, I don't get out much.
Divinely?
Quiet -- sshhh!!
How should <u>I know</u>?
Alright, alright, I'll try to get directions from one of the locals.
Yeah, well I have it on a reliable source...  that it exists.  Now you follow the yellow egg...  <u>That</u> direction.
<u>I</u> ruined <u>your</u> life?  Look, I was perfectly happy until I met you -- alright, I was miserable, but I was <u>happily miserable</u>.
Come on -- it's gone!  What are the chances of that happening again?
Well...no, but --
There's something going on, Z --
You did?
I just joined up.  But I'm quitting! I got a trial membership!
Superior numbers, kid!
Maybe they went out for the evening. Let's leave them a message and head home.
No -- I can see it in your eyes.  I'm a goner.  It's alright, Z.  In this ant's army, a soldier's life ain't worth a sack of fungus.  I can't feel my legs...
Princess!  You look -- outstanding. Is there anything I can do for you?
That's correct, sir!
Dammit, I'm proud to be an ant.  And I know each and every one of you boys will do your duty.  Dismissed.
So...you two are in love?
Yes, and do you know <u>why</u> there's a food shortage?
Negatory.  <u>Too many ants</u>.  And while we soldiers go out there, and fight, and bleed, and die for the colony, the namby-pamby workers live it up back home.
I tell you son, sometimes, at night, I see myself in battle, fighting a horrible, faceless enemy, with the future of our whole species at stake. And always, the dream ends with each of us plunging his sword into the other's heart...
Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
We are launching a major offensive to expand our foraging territory...
Z, we've known each other a long time, right?
And all the time I've known you, you've been grumping and groaning. You should quit making waves.  Go with the flow.
Are you kidding?  There were sparks between us!  This scarf is a sign!
What's gonna go wrong?!  I take your place for the royal inspection.  Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>!  Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little...  tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
My mother.
Yeah.  How much?
That's right.  Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE  Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Something the matter?
Big shot! For you, I wouldn't lift a finger -- but for her, I'll fix a little something to eat.
Well, I have some paper towels --
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
How is your cold?
Oh.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Of course not.
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
Oh.  Yes?  Just a minute.  If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
Two o'clock.
No -- it's my stomach.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
I'm not very good at it.
Pick a card.
Gin.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
Who'd care?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
No, I don't.
Where?
That's terrible.
Oh.
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
Shut up and deal!
No, no.  Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
What for?
Gas?
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
That's right, Baxter.
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Oh, you don't have to worry --
The mirror is broken.  It was broken when I found it.
Sir?
That's right.  I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
Now what was your news, Baxter?
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
You?
I know, Buddy-boy, I know.  But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
That's right.  We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise --  -- and I told him what a bright boy you were.  They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
I have a vague idea.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club!  Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again!  You know where I am if you need me.
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
No.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
Nothing.  Just clear out, will you?
So you don't have to play innocent with me. He used to tell his wife that I was the branch manager from Seattle -- four years ago when we were having a little ring-a-ding- ding.
And before me there was Miss Rossi in Auditing -- and after me there was Miss Koch in Disability -- and just before you there was Miss What's-Her-Name, on the twenty- fifth floor --
It's on the way.  I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
We talked about a lot of things.
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
Are you sure that's what you want?
I love you -- remember?
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Atlantic City?
The nerve.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
Lovely. You were a big help.
Yeah, I caught your show at Hau Fat.
Dreadful.
Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that --
Esprit de corps --
One for all -- all for one --
Get out --
We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too --
Part.
I'm sure it is, but I had hepatitis.
Let's talk about you.
Tracks ?
Then went too far -- he sat there and starts mutilating the centerfold. Poking pins in her an' all that. Sergeant says, don't do her like that. You leave your shitty little hands off that girl. Gook Lieutenant says Fuck you in Vietnamese -- Sergeant says, don't do that again. You'll wish you hadn't. Then he stood up, flicked his iron to rock and roll and gave the little zero a long burst through the Playboy mag. Man, it blew him clean off the dock -- Hell, just the magazine was floatin' there all full of holes.
No, sir -- I'm a real chef, sir -- I'm a sauciere --
They lined us all up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib -- magnificent meat, beautifully marbled.. Then they started throwing it in these big cauldrons, all of it -- boiling. I looked in, an' it was turning gray. I couldn't stand it. I went into radio school.
Still got a lot of that stuff from Nha Trang. But we're running low on the other.
I know.
I'll go with you in a while -- judt hold tight awhile --
Where ?
I'll go with him --
This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party.
I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold.
What is it?
One that went up for murder -- he was an Army Sergeant.
Yeah -- he really dug his Playboy mag, man -- I mean like he was there when it arrived -- He just knew.
I wonder if that was the same copter.
Anyone got a cigarette.
You can see, of course, the implications, if any of this -- even rumours leaked out.
He's commanding the detachment at Nu Mung Ba.
Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.
You'll get blown outta here some day.
We endure, captain -- you can blow up the house and we will live in the cellar -- destroy that and we'll dig a hole in the jungle and sleep on it. Burn the forest and we'll hide in the swamp. all the while, we do but one thing -- clean the blood off our bayonets.  Au revoir, Captain.
Gunner's Mate, Third Class -- L. Johnson, sir.
I think we ought to wait for the tide to come in.
Boss left.
It's hairy ,though. That's where we lost McDonnel -- they shot the hell out of us. It's Charlie's point.
Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain.
Mercenaries -- agents, traitors -- they put out caches.
I met him.
So? I heard you had a good bunch of killers here.
You'll find enough Cong up there.
No -- no, sir.
Yes.
You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.
No. My thinking is clear.  But my soul has gone mad.
Fuck no.
You had immense plans... immense plans...
You knew him best.
Both of us...
What is this bridge?
You're Australian?
And shut up.
The river is beautiful.
Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order.
Big show in the parade grounds this noon -- some boss stuff --
Stepped on a booby trap, sir -- got blown all to hell --
You can pack out of here -- two, three days' hike along this river at most.  Weather should hold this early in the season.
Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
89   CONTINUED:
Used to see the natives eating roots when I was a kid in Nome.
157  CONTINUED:
I was making my rounds, saw your hangar wide open, plane getting rained on, so I closed it up.
26   CONTINUED:  
Six months.
Knew you had no native blood, even with your dark hair.  Blue eyes give you away.  My wife had blue eyes.
She's dead.
The radio's on the fritz.
He was sitting in a hot tub with a hooker.
I'll tell you everything later.
-- Killing is what you know.  Pack some food while I prep for the flight.  I'm sure not gonna let him go.
I took the odds on getting down in one piece, and I made it.  Now we're in my territory.
Snow shelter.  Okay.  You dig. I'll have a little sit-down.
I'm right behind you.
It wasn't my idea to crash the plane.
You know Meyerling?
I'm here to do my job.
You're not going to slow us down! Keep moving!
Cowardly bastard.  I'm in handcuffs and I still scare the piss out of you.
Hell, I still get a knot in my gut every season, wondering how much longer I can go on.  No 'Home for Retired Trappers' that -more-
I don't want to hurt you, Sam.
Nothing personal.
Sure.
Look, Neff, I've got Ben Corbett with me --
Corbett ruined my two-way.  Go to my place on the Haul Road, tell Anne Marie I'm okay and to sit tight.
There'll be three, four men at the most.  I have some backup, nothing will happen.
What does this matter to you?
Fuck you.
I just as soon he stay gone. Fool could've got us all killed, arresting Ben Corbett here in town.
Corbett coming here stinks of trouble.  We should make the best of it before it turns around and bites us in the ass.
Goddamn!  Viking Bob!  Mitchell's inside, boring bastard...
Maybe they went back to Devil's Cauldron.
What you gonna do with it?  Large bore's for shit on small game.
Quit fucking around.  Get in.
Doesn't matter.  We know where they're going.  C'mon.
Musta never got a chance to -more-
That plane might've been to throw us off the track.  Remember the bait-and-switch Wilder pulled with the Eskimo and his truck?
We were just talking about him.
Musta wanted to keep him from the bears.  If Ben killed him, he sure as hell wouldn't hang him up like this.
Sit your suspect out in the cold. He'll keep.
Do you really want to go back to the runt doctors in Emergency who keep telling us they can't help?
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Yes.
Emergency room only.
No.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
I see the help -- judgement call.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Carol the waitress?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Thank you.
I want you to go on this trip.
What's that got to do with it?
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next.  That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Oh.  We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Whether crabs are in season there now...
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
It was a mistake.
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
Yeah... Well...
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Okay.
You know what? I...
Yes. I really would.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
I just love her.  How're you doing?
Don't want to. I love you.
No. No. Get Carol.
There's not going to be a debate. You must leave.
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time...  I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
He's a pain in the ass.
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
Wait here.
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
Well, I can't reach them.
Ask him.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
How're you doing?
Maybe this can wait.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone...  don't knock ...  not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Oh, my gosh.
Come on, sweetheart...
Thanks.
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
Another place where?
Just a second -- he has to go.
No. No. No. Hey, that painting in there...  I just want to tell you...
Where?
What restaurant?
So you're from around here?
What is this?
Get out.  You think I'm running you up?  Get out.
The hell I can't.  It's my cab.  I don't like you.  So, get the hell out!
Tachlinkov.
We go around once.
Oh, yeah.
Bain!
You're too late.
I don't give a fuck what you are.  I asked you --
I'm part of the game, just like you.
Turn off the engine.
You're the computer hacker, you tell me.
Yellow Pages.  V for veterinarian. There aren't that many.
Yes.
If it hadn't been for me, you would be dead.
Because he took a contract on you. He'll come for you and he'll find you.
He was Russian.  Nicholai Tachlinkov.  A legend in the business when I was just starting. I admired him.  When I heard he loved chess I became obsessed with the game.
Why not?
Ahhhh...
Are they usually like that?
After that?
That's fiction.
Why not?
Yes.
No.
I don't know... maybe I'll live on a boat, sail to all the places I've never been.
I don't know... But I'm sure he's not sleeping.
That means you won't have a gun.
You'll have the money.  How do I know that you won't --
Sounds pretty well figured out.
Except --
He said I couldn't win.  That no one wins at this game.
No.  I went back to the hotel.  And waited.
I didn't notice them.
How do you know they're not?
Jesus, if someone had --
It's always been that way.  The world has always functioned on two levels.
Why?
And you were drilling these holes...?
I'm playing white, remember.  You can't tell me which pieces to move. It doesn't work that way.
It can be.
I'm not sure that I care anymore.
Yes.
How can a beautiful man like you be shy?
I'd love one.  Whatever you're having.
I think you're supposed to answer that question.
Sometimes.
No.  They call me, I don't call them.  If they didn't call I wouldn't exist.
All the time.
Do you believe that?
Sure.
Average.
Everyone who plays the game knows the rules.
Do they get down on their knees, begging and crying?
When I thought about this, that was always there, in the back of my head, that image of me on my knees, crying.  It wouldn't go away and it would really upset me. It was something that I could never get away from... but now, I feel it's okay.  I feel good.
Anything.
You mean quit?
I used to think about it.  I had Margaret.  She wanted kids.  I thought about moving somewhere far away like, Europe.  I could see all of that, the first part, the getting away but I couldn't see that next part.  'Then what?' So I'd stop thinking about it and go back to work.  You understand?
No.
That's correct.
I'm sorry, but I am waiting for an associate.  Can you hold everything for me until he arrives?
Thank you.
Like you?
And not even then sometimes.
What's that? Free!
That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
He was an electrician?
I'll try not to, I'll leave that to you. Anyway, there's still plenty more of it.
No....The Asylum!
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
No, for the Asylum.
Am I late?
No, the boyfriend.
Holly!
It just happened.
What are you on about?
What?
You might make Henry happy......Sure, I'll do it.
That bad?
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Here!
I'm not hungry, really.
No, by road?
Yeah....Shit, those guys have guns.
I'm just here to record some details, standard stuff.
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Regards to Her Majesty.
I'll take a rain-check for now.
Shhhhh, I'm concentrating!
I don't care. I'm not staying out late Doug.
What? You are crazy!
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
Fernet and tonic.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Don't worry. Thanks.
How?
A month, Jesus! And how do I know you're not crapping me?
Of course, you can see that lady over there, she is recording everything.
Well she sure isn't normal.
We don't need you.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
Yeah seems okay.
Sure!
Hmm, I still owe him.
It's Josh's.
It was the biggest I could find.
A kind of freedom.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
Not all of them!
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
You may use my office.
It's time to go home, Holly.
Go to hell!
You bastard!
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
Very well.
Heart be still.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I didn't know either.
I need to whizz.
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
-- Obviously.
Were?
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
'They won't.'
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
Looking for something -- someone.
Don't you?
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
Yes. And?
Yeah --
Belinda's a very jealous person.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
What?
I wanted this to be a date.
Where?
Loved?
The truth. I just left you out of it.
Me.
Pull over.
Anything you want.
I used to like yogurt.
That I want you to take me home.
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
No.
Dad --
I don't want to see her hurt.
How -- how long does she have?
Praying.
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
I'm not tired.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
I helped Jamie with the first one.
She did. But hardly anyone does anything truly alone.
That's right.  The world is your oyster.
The day I show respect to Biff Tannen will be the day I win a million dollars... What's the matter, Biff, they're not showing you any respect down at the golf course? Don't they realize what a tough job it is keeping the criminal element away from the country club?
What do you want, Biff?
I beg your pardon?
Uh, yes, sir...
I don't know. National Cash Register?
Uh, hi....
Oh, I'm feeling much better now.
Listen,  Professor Brown told me you called last night and gave me your message...
Oh, no, I'm fine...fine.
Saturday night's the 'Springtime in Paris' dance. I'm taking Suzy Parker.
Christ, it's a miracle I was even born! 
Why is she gonna get angry with you?
Uh -- yeah. I'm new here, and I'm supposed to be in this class.
Operator, what's today's date?
No, no, not beyond an acceptable level. Have you been X-rayed recently, Martin?
Shhhhhhhh!
That reminds me, if we could scrape up enough for a 35 film chain, I've got a connection with a projectionist in a first run house -- we could be sellin' new movies on the street before they're even in the theater.
Nope. The way I figure it, doors are made to be opened. See you after school.
Is Shemp all right?
Marty.
We don't....
What if you lost your keys?
Okay, Professor, I get where you're coming from. The way I look, the way I'm dressed...  I'd stick out like a sore thumb.
Professor, be serious, would you?
You better make sure your old man asks her out, because if he doesn't, they may never have a first date. And if they don't have a first date, they won't have a second date. If they don't have a second date, they won't fall in love. If they don't fall in love, they won't get married, and if they don't get married, you'll never be born!
Jesus!
Nope. My father's never clenched a fist in his entire life!
I run this place! 
He said not to tell.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
Yeah.
What do you mean?
Kind of round, like so... Gold. I'll show you if you want.
Mmmmm.
Sure.
What'd you come out here for?
Is that right?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
It's okay.
There you go.
Yeah.
You said that once already... Too late now.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
How's he doing?
Excuse me.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
I just don't want to go.
Yes.
Stay as long as you like.
Just thinking.
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Well, matter of fact, I don't have any.
Who're you?
You mean the guy from the old wine commercials?
Then that's it!
It's your hand, Buckaroo.
Vanished. Thin air.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
Sure do pack a mean wallop...let's go...
Yeah, but most of 'em blasted in through the Eighth Dimension in 1938 at Grover's Mills, New Jersey...
Whorfin?  Does he know we're coming?
Don't look at me, Buckaroo Banzai.  I failed flight school.
The door's locked.
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best.  Stall.
This is so embarrassing...
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
Which?  The one in my throat.
You don't wanna know.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Believe in Penny Priddy?
A black thermopod here?  On Earth?!  Why, John Gomez?  Why?
Still no confirmation either from SAC or Strategic Space Command.  They report all surveillance satellite communication jammed.
Perfect Tommy's just threatened by smart women.  Can you play that thing?
Doesn't look anything like her to me.
Whadda you need Buckaroo for?
Flying to Cambodia.
How about you? Will you be alright?
...I know this must look... funny.
That son of a bitch... Don't get me wrong, he's a fine writer.
Really?...
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
Yes. Thank you. How's Bill?
You wrote Bill's scripts!  Jesus Christ, you wrote his – what about before that?
Hah!
Who is that?! Gaddamn voices come into the house... sons of bitches...
...Once or twice. His name is Charlie Meadows.
So. You talked to Mundt, what about?
And what would that be, son?
We need Indians for a Norman Steele western.
But Lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.
Well not much.
You don't understand. He's in pain, because he can't write-
Are you deaf, he LIKES you! He's taken an interest! What the hell did you say to him?
Who said write? Jesus, Jack can't read.  You gotta TELL it to him-tell him SOMEthing for Chrissake.
Okay Barton, you're the artist, I'm just the ten percenter. You decide what you want and I'll make it happen. I'm only asking that your decision be informed by a little realism – if I can use that word and Hollywood in the same breath.
No, what did it say?
Yeah, I'm fine, Garland – I have to talk to you. I'm calling long distance.
Have you read the Bible, Garland?
Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
Hell, why not? Everyone wants quality. What kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...
Well, that's a good question. Strange as it may seem, Charlie, I guess I write about people like you. The average working stiff. The common man.
Hell, I could tell you some stories–
I can see you feel pretty strongly about it.
You know, in a way, I envy you Charlie.  Your daily routine – you know what's expected. You know the drill. My job is to plumb the depths, so to speak, dredge something up from inside, something honest. There's no road map for that territory...
Not at all. It's damned interesting.
...Yeah, okay.
Well, that's all that wrestling is. Except usually there's more grunting and squirming before the pin. Well, it's your first time. And you're out of your weight class.
Hi, Charlie.
Yeah, as a matter of fact they did. Come on in.
Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer.  Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
Thanks, brother. But the fact is, I gotta pull up stakes temporarily.
Charlie, I'm in trouble. You've gotta help me.
You gotta believe me –
I don't know! I woke up, she was... God, you gotta believe me!
They GOTTA believe me, Charlie! They gotta have mercy!
Dammit, don't argue with me. You asked me to believe you – well I do. Now don't argue with me.
I'm at the Earle.
...Both maybe?
Ah, forget it, kid. I want you to pull this out of your head. If that sonofabitch wouldn't apologize to you, goddammit, I will. I respect your artistry and your methods, and if you can't fill us in yet, well hell, we should be kissing your feet for your fine efforts.
You're a sick fuck, Fink.
His name is Mundt. Karl Mundt.
He's a little funny in the head.
Couple of days ago we see the same M.O. out in Los Feliz.
All of which he's now missin'.
Anyway.
Female caucasian, thirty years old. Nice tits. No head. You ever see Mundt with anyone meets that description?
Give you nose bleeds?
You two have some sick sex thing?
Ah, hell, let Bart take a crack at it.  He'll get into the swing of things or I don't know writers. Let's make it a dame, Bart, keep it simple. We don't gotta tackle the world our first time out. The important thing is we all have that Barton Fink feeling, but since you're Barton Fink I'm assuming you have it in spades.  Seriously Bart, I like you. We're off to a good start. Dammit, if all our writers were like you I wouldn't have to get so goddamn involved. I'd like to see something by the end of the week.
Mr. Lipnik, please –
Do you have any evidence that he showed your psychiatric file to anyone?
Home. Watching TV.
Yeah.
When did you start drinking again?
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
My sex life is fine.  My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
Yeah.
She said what you said she'd say.
Why didn't you tell me?
Nilsen.
What was she like in school?
Tell me about Catherine.
She didn't hand you to me.  She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
About a year and a half.
Yes.
Are you arresting me?
Only when they make interesting reading.
It won't last.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
No.
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
Why not?
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
There's a name from the past.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
Don't get too cocky.
What if I call you Nicky?
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
To see if I can get away with it.
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
I don't have a choice.
No.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
I never have before.
Try me.
I found Lisa Henderson.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
What are you researching?
What happens to them?
It won't sell.
We fuck like minks.  We raise rugrats.  We live happily ever after.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
He was murdered.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Do you remember his name?
The usual -- a girlfriend.
Nope. She did.  Like I say.  It never panned.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
She misses me.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Hell yes!  Couldn't get it outta my head for years.  Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems.  One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em.  All of 'em.  Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it.  Sweet as honey.  Said she didn't know why she done it.
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
You oughta use a rubber, pop.  You really should.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no.  I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
Catherine told me what was in it.
Maybe she did, Gus.  Maybe she grew herself an Afro and learned a left hook and put shoe polish on her face.  Let's polygraph her again and ask her about it.
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
Go stick your head in a tub of ice water.  See where she leads.
You forgot her degree in literature. She's a writer.  She published a novel last year under a pen name. Do you want to know what it's about?
We bring her in for questioning.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
What now what? Now nothing.  She passed the polygraph.  That's it.
Her parents died in an accident. I don't care what else she's written.  What are you -- a book critic?
Catherine Tramell.  It's part of her game.
It was an accident.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
On what basis?
She was the last person seen with the guy -- I'll take the responsibility.
Are you vice?
I'm Roxy.  I'm her -- friend.
No. Should I have?
Not sure. How was yours?
Do you ever get sick of it?
I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out.
Oh, I didn't know that.
My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that!
Yeah, I met her already.
Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent.
I don't like beer.
How do you know?
Sure, ok..
I need a dealer.
Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that note from? Where do you take your words from?  Everywhere.
Who said that?
Chateau Latour '64, please.
See that table over there? I'd like to pay their bill.
Really?
Use your fucking instinct.
Why don't you try letting her in, Steve – I mean Shenge.
Thanks.  Your dad called again – something about a job.
We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist – she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.
So then what?
I guess it was a long time ago.
C'mon, baby, I painted them for you. They're beautiful now.
It's Monday morning.
I hadn't thought about it.
You mean babies with you?
You're your own baby.
Hi.
A present I picked up for you.
He's not. He's out of town and he calls me every day. What's weird about him?
What's that about?
I don't believe it, Jean – they're picking straws.
Me? Why?
You like your dad's paintings?
Thanks
Have a Mac.
Fuck...  I forgot about that.
Tony Bennett... What do you mean?
Thanks... I'll take it tonight.
That's impossible. I've got, like, five of 'em!
I just don't think you're being fair.
Yo... You know why Rammellzee's here, don't you?
"Affair" ... yes, maybe ... if she ...
You'll never guess.
Touring the riot scene.  Gravely assessing the devastation. Upstanding mayor stuff.
Well, I could ... free up some time...
Treat to be here.
I wouldn't be caught dead.  No, it's probably how I would be caught.  The Mayor stupidly took Cobblepot's bait --
Yes and no...
Somewhat like the lonesome secretary syndrome, I'd suppose.
If I said yes, then you might think me a Norman Bates, or a Ted Bundy type ... and then you might not let me kiss you.
Y'mean take off our costumes?
But a kiss can be even deadlier, if you mean ... it.
I don't know.  Till we figure it out, let's ... let's keep dancing.
Weird, huh?
Max, I'm gonna fight you on this. The Mayor and I have already spoken and we see eye to eye here.  So --
Sorry, Max.  A die for a die.
He <u>is</u> Batman, you moron.
Batman.  The thorn in both our sides, the fly in our ointment.
You're off the hook, Ozzie.  But Batman is decidedly <u>not</u>.
The name is Oswald Cobblepot.
Women... nothing surprises me, Chip. Excepting your late mother... Who even knew Selina had a brain to damage?  Bottom line:  she tries to blackmail us, we drop her out a higher window.  Meanwhile I got badder fish to fry.  Yeah -- Oswald, please.
And exactly <u>why</u> am <u>I</u> gonna help <u>you</u>?
A big bag of fan mail?  Filthy lucre?  Wait don't tell me ... Is it a broad?
I'm the one you want!  Penguin, please!  Ask yourself:  Isn't it Max Shreck who manipulated and betrayed you?  Isn't it Max, not Chip, whom you want to see immersed up to his eyeballs in raw sewage?
And who ... would you say this <u>to</u>?
Ten years.  Barbara isn't really me niece, sir. She's Joanna Clark's daughter.
Oh no, those things frighten me.
I have been trying to reach Wilfred with no success.  As one grows older, one yearns for family.
As I've missed you.  Sleep well, child.
I have been part of the greatest adventure ever know.  I have found purpose here, and the family I could never have.
Perhaps the truth is you don't really trust anyone.
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house, don't you think?
There's a lovely inn just down --
Alfred, I know you're sick -- I can get you the best doctors.
Remember this.  And remember it always.  I'm proud of you.  And I love you too, son.
What seems to be the problem?
Keep it.
Alfred and Bruce are like family.
Alfred's happy here.
Nightwing.  Scourge of darkest evil.
I know.  The feeling just vanished.
Definitely.
A poison kiss?  You have some real issues with women, you know that?  You just couldn't stand that she was about to kiss me.  Couldn't stand that something might be mine and not yours.  Could you?!
She knows who we are.
Don't make me kill you in front of the girl.
Actually, I already work for you. Or did.  Your arboreal preservation project in South America.
I see you knew him.
Can I get some help over here?
What?  I'm sorry.  You were saying...
I know you're a dedicated bachelor. That you've had a your wild nights.
What?
Presumed dead.  No one knows.
Whoa, I made a mistake.  I'm sorry. Don't go all protective on me.  It won't happen again.
Anybody want to tell us kids in the cheap seats who Joanna Clark is?
Dick, don't push me right now.
She's clouded your mind.  You're not thinking straight.
I knew you could handle it.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's.  But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Adam and Evil.
You're skating on thin ice.  My passion thaws for my bride alone.
Of trust. Tell me your plan.
Then you never loved me?
Then you'd have nothing to complain about.
What did you say?
Of course. 13 is M....MRE.
Claw Island. Nygma's headquarters. I'm sure that's where they're keeping Chase.  Are all the Batsuits destroyed?
Just checking, young sir.
I'm flattered. Not every girl makes a super-hero's night table.  You might have some interesting insights into Two-Face.
Are you trying to get under my cape, Doctor?
It's the car, right? Chicks love the car.
No more tricks, Edward. Release Chase and Dick. This is between you and me.
Excellent. See. Who says a guy in a rubber suit can't be smart? Well, it's been grand. Sorry you all have to die now.
Bruce Wayne. In the flesh.
Nygma. Edward Nygma. You hired me. Personally. Just like I tell everyone.  Well, we've never actually met, but your name was on the hire slip.
Wait. You can't go.
Somebody's been sending me love letters. Commissioner Gordon thought you might give me your expert opinion.
So what you're saying, this guy's a total wacko, right?
I don't get you Bruce Wayne.
The glib, cavalier routine, it really is an act, isn't it?
What?
Excuse me, boys. I'd hate to stop this testosterone flood on my account-
Okay, tiger, take it slow. You going to give me your pin or something?
I saved your life. You owe me. So either you let me be your partner or I'm going after Harvey on my own.
Dick, let go. Revenge will eat you alive. Trust me. I know.
And when you finally get Two-Face?
Can't tell if you don't say please.
...Fired...your fired...your fired. You understand?! Fired!!
Please. I swear I won't say noth-
You _are_ Two-Face, you would need to face both rivers, both uptown and downtown simultaneously. Only one spot in Gotham serves these bi- zonal, bi-coastal needs...
Let's see if you bleed green.
So not everyone can be a poet. Still, I respect the sentiment.
Here. Get a good seat.
I'd say about thirty feet, sir.
Respectfully, sir... there'll never be another one like you.
Don't ever say that, sir. Don't ever believe it.
WHICH CAR?
I know. I called them.
He won't kill her. -- GODDAMMIT!
... A hundred and eight?
... Where are you taking me?
Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
What is it you want?
Neither had I.  Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it.  Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it.
Maybe we should just kiss.
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
No one would miss me.
What are you talking about?
Look, Johnny Gobs got ripped and walked off a roof, all right?  No big loss.
No wonder you're such a chickenshit.  Now shut up.  There ain't no bat.
Because I want someone I can trust.
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me.  What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser.  Did you get your invitation yet?
Well, I'm starving.  Will you at least buy me a hamburger?
Some.  I am a rich bitch, remember?  I'm quoting.
... Oh?  Why is that, Vicki?
... Okay, then, I have a confession to make.  I'm the Batman.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
Sounds great.  Excellent.  Though-, Ahm... there's this guy who's coming to work at the Gallery, from England...
I said I'd check with you.
What's wrong with you, David?  All you have to do is say, Excuse me, I've been sitting here since the start of the Millennium and I'd really like some action from you before the end of the world. I'll go.
Now what does that mean?  My daughter wakes up with a strange man in her bed, and I'm supposed to think it's amusing?  That tie's God-awful.  Why do you wear it?
No, I'm fine.
Night.
Great.  Classic timing.  Why don't you ask her just to leave a date for the divorce?  I'll check my diary later.
Yes.  Ahm... think I'11 ...
Ahm.....
Whistler was a great painter, but he wasn't a great chooser of paints ....
Well, Ahm....
But the particular glory of the system... is that it can also work oh large screens in each individual room - so we can network the program to every room in the gallery.
She's ... well, she's good.
Yes, isn't he.
Great news.
Okay, sir.  Certainly.  Good.
I thought perhaps as Vice-President, and in view of the unfortunate attendance's for the summer show this year... the MASSIVE financial LOSS ...
Time taken its toll on the old girl, eh?
Certainly is.
Richard Burton was very good-looking.
Not in one piece anyway.  I see Mrs Whistler as kind of ... like my own dear mother.  I'd kill any man that tried to interfere with her.  The Vice President here will vouch for that.
That's one - way of looking at it.  You might also say this guy is brainless he has no brain'.
I'11 give you a chance... Know anything about computers?
Damn.  I was just going to Number 4 ....
Yes it is ... may I introduce you To Bern ...
It's a kind of an interesting swap. Mom for the Man from Ga Ga.
Sting?!  Sounds like something you put on a rash.
No it wasn't!
Yeah, heh heh, and then we're gonna get a big-screen TV! Heh heh.
Huh huh. Soon, she will be mine.
Uh... maybe he's blind... Huh huh, check this out.
Heh heh. Yeah.
Me first!
Cut it out butt-hole!
Yeah, heh heh, enough'a this crap.
Cool! Huh huh huh.
Huh huh. Get out of the way, Beavis, I wanna sit by the window. Huh huh.
Uh... I think I'm seeing something too. It's like a really long time ago...
Uh, oh yeah. Cool. They can take us to Washington and we can finally score.
Yeah. We can go see Hole and then we can get some hole. Huh huh huh huh.
Butt-dumpling...
Uh... butt-snatch...
Oh, uh, I mean, uh, ass-goblin...
That's alright. I'd rather not know your real names anyways. I'm Muddy. Look, I'm gonna get right to the point. I'll pay you ten grand plus expenses, all payable after you do her...
Huh huh. You guys are funny. Let's have a drink on it.
Why it's you two. How'd ya do in Vegas?
He's jerkin' us off. I think we're gonna have to take him out. Get ready to fire on my orders...  This is your last chance. Give us the unit now...
Dammit!  Where's that damn unit??!!
Ah, the witness?
Damn! Where the hell is he? We should've found him by now.
Where are his pants?
Yoo-hoo! Travis and Bob Head. Whoo-hoo!
Uh, my butt and your...uh, butt.
Yeah, they were sluts. Huh huh huh.
I don't see anything about 'Rewards and Punishments' or 'Heaven and Hell.'  This book reads like stereo instructions!  Listen to this... 'Geographical and Temporal Perimeters... Functional perimeters vary from manifestation to manifestation.'  This is going to take some time.
<u>You</u> left me.
Nothing.  The bio buster?  I don't get it...
We're not going to wait here like cornered animals.  I can tell you that.  We need help.  I'm going to talk to that little girl.
Look at this, everything is different down here.  All our furniture is gone.
She's got <u>photos</u>, Barbara.
Of course I did.
I don't care, I've changed my mind.  ... I feel <u>really</u> confident.  We're getting better at this stuff.  We can scare them off ourselves -- tonight!  I've got an idea.  You're going to love it... I'm going to hate it.
Let's see if she can get my model back.
I certainly did.  I'd finish it too, but... I don't get out much.
Wait a minute.  I had some licorice ice cream earlier.  You guys could be gas.  What if... I'm dreaming. Can you do any neat tricks to prove you're not gas?
Good luck.  You're going to use up all your help vouchers.
We have to start simpler, is that it?
Bio-<u>busting</u>.  I <u>loves</u> bio-busting. Who do I gotta kill?  Family -- right?  Obnoxious I bet.  Mommie, daddy, piglets.
Hey <u>you've</u> been on Saturn!  I <u>hate</u> those sandworms!  <u>Yecchhh</u>! I've lost a lot of buddies to sandworms.  So a daughter?  She got good legs? God I love a young leg.
Hey, I've been in a frigging bottle for six hundred years.  I was out.  Every dog has his day. This is my town.  I need a night to howl.
About what?
No, Lydia, we're dead.
And live in what, our station wagon?
'Bye, Jane, I'll see you in church in a couple weeks.
They're dead.
Well, it can't be any worse than my life here.
I... I don't know what your name is.
It's spelled different, but basically... Now you said it twice; just one more time, and I'll be free.  And then <u>you'll</u> be free.
How'd you like to have the biggest boobs in the world?  Right now.  I can do it if I get out.
How'd you like to be married to... the King...?
Otho, why didn't you just come in the door?
Let's hope he knows how to produce those damn ghosts for Max and Sarah... Because I've bought options on property all over town.  I need Max's financing...
My whole life is a darkroom!  One ... big... dark... room.
Lydia, we're the first trickle! In a couple of years this whole town will be <u>filled</u> with people like us.
Stepmother.
Lydia, I don't know what it is with you and these pratical jokes, but --
Come on.  Leave their stuff alone.
I cannot believe this.
I can't <u>bring</u> the ghosts.  They're not here!
Nonsense, everytime she says that, the paint peels, and some wild creature tries to kill us.
They're already dead.  They can't feel a thing.
This is our first meal in this house, Lydia.  Why don't we all do our little private parts to make it a pleasant one?
I saw some ghosts.
Viridian?
<u>I know</u>!  We just have to <u>pray</u> that the other closets are bigger than this one.
Attic space.
Probably the world's largest <u>Reader's</u> <u>Digest</u> collection!  C'mon, let's have some chablis, Otho, I'm laid bare by this experience.  Entirely bare.
That's a skeleton key.  It'll open any door in that house.  Will you give it to your father?  And you might mention that I single-handedly decorated the house.  In case he needs advice in that area.  Come see me.
Yes, but I'm going to live at home.
Hold your breath and we'll pull.
My sentiments exactly.  Porcelain is for teeth!
I'll need something personal of theirs.
Their wedding clothes.
Oh, fine.
Yes.
Thank you.
Yes, I could stay here. Thank you.
Yes, Robert. I will.
Hardly any, Robert.
Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
... You've become quite a close friend of Eve's - haven't you Mr...  ... Chance...?
I see...  ... And you are really a gardener, aren't you?
To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
I don't think so, he should be along soon...
Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?
Gardiner is not a foreign agent, there are now sixteen countries investigating the man. We can rule that out.
And what do the boys around Intelligence think?
Gentlemen, needless to say, there is going to be a full Congressional investigation of your respective operations.  Good night.
Well, I still don't believe I know the man, Mr. Gardiner. Now, hold still.
Thank you.
Yes. I would like to be on that show.
There's no need for a hospital.
I agree.
I like to watch. This is fine.
Yes.
No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
He was a very wealthy man, he looked after me since I was young.
... Mentor...?
Hello, Eve.
That's good. I like to watch, too.
I see.
Yes. That could be true.
Thank you.
No. I'm not busy.
Yes, I do, it's very good.
Ben is very ill.
We are not far...  ... our chairs almost touch.
Do you think so? Do you think so?
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
Yes. Chauncey is fine.
I see. I would like to work in your garden.
But I don't have that any more...  ... All that's left for me now is the room upstairs.
You're looking much better today, Ben.
I understand.
Yes. That is correct.
I understand.
A flower...
Yes.
Yes, I would like to see Ben.
No.
No.  That's where Joe fixed the bricks.
It is quite amazing how those clothes have come back into style.
No. I'm not badly injured. But my leg is very sore.
I agree.
How long? I don't know, see what the doctor says ...
... Good evening, Louise.
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
I am a very serious gardener.
... The gardener?  ... Yes, of course... Mr. Chance, this is Ms. Hayes.
Yes, Thomas - I understand.
Yes. Louise will bring me lunch.
I live here.
No, I do not have any of those.
Yes and the Old Man used to come to my garden. He would read and rest there.
You have me, I am here. What more proof do you need?
Very well, Mr. Chance - if you insist on dragging this matter on... But I must inform you this house will be closed tomorrow at noon. If indeed, you do reside here, you will have to move out.
Try again.
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much.  ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
Oh, no, sweetheart - it's not you...
Gladly...  ... The safe is in Mr. Jennings' bedroom, that'll be stop number one.
... It's very bizarre - I don't know what to think...
He does talk like one, but I think he's brilliant.
Sally Hayes is not a bitch - she's a damn fine attorney! I've got to talk to her about this Gardiner...
There is no information available on the man before he moved into Benjamin Rand's. It has proven to be such a difficult task that it has resulted in the loss of one of our agents to the United States Government.
Very good, Your Excellency.
Gardiner, yes, sir.
No problem, Chief.
Right, Chief.
Right, Chief.
Well, sir - it occurred to us that he might be an agent of a foreign power. But, we ruled that out, as they invariably are provided with too much documentation, too much American identity... We, uh...don't quite know what to make of it yet, sir... But we'll keep on top of it, Mr. President - we'll come up with the answer.
Thank you, Colonel.
Mr. Gardiner, my pleasure.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
Please, have a seat.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
We have to make it an early night.
Hmmm.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
What?
Life is confusing, isn't it?
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated.  No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
Holy shit! He said what I said!
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
Schwartz.
I am a trained performer.
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you.  But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
You're insane.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
Great.  Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
I'm right?
My tits?
Don’t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
I'll protect you, Dollface.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
Ha ha ha!
Can I be anyone I want?
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
Maxine says she'll leave him if he leaves Malkovich, plus he's been challenged to a puppet-duel by Mantini.
Why are you being like this?
Well, if Mantini wins, Schwartz will leave Malkovich, right? So, if he needs it, I help Mantini's performance a bit, give him an edge. Spice up the show.
Fine. Let's drop it.
Fine. I'm not mad. Let's just drop it.
Do you?
All the better. Hey, Hot Lesbian Witches, next Geraldo, buddy boy. Ha ha ha.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Why not? I need to get in there!
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
I love you, Lotte.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
Did you see the reviews?
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
Derek Mantini!
What want ye, girl child?
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
The boys wouldn't have left if Halle were here.
WHERE ARE THE MEN WITHOUT SKIN?
YES. I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE.
Don't say those things. You forget about those dreams..
Mama told you - I'd give up my own life, every minute, every hour of it to take back one of your tears baby...My children my best thing. You my best thing!
We don't have nothing sweet no more, baby.
Thank you.
I will.
May I come in?
Oh.
Ya think?
Work? Start learnin your letters again?
DO YOU FORGIVE ME?
Morning, ma'am.
Oh I been out.
Better ask Paul D.
I don't know him that well.
I run him off.
He didn't know nothing. And nobody. Except her, from when they was at that place Baby Suggs was at.
That's so.
Just me.
Never found out.
I don't believe that. I won't.
What yard? When who-
You ain't scared of Sethe. I don't believe you.
Yeah. Look bad?
She was my best thing.
Plank Road. Yes sir. That's up a ways. Mile, maybe.
Just, uh, just slip the rent under my door.
And we know which Lebowski you are, Lebowski.
Yeah sure, if I'm ever in the neighborhood, need to use the john.
Why me, man?
Well, okay, you're not privy to all the new shit, so uh, you know, but that's what you pay me for.  Speaking of which, would it be possible for me to get my twenty grand in cash? I gotta check this with my accountant of course, but my concern is that, you know, it could bump me into a higher tax--
Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn?
Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago.
Fuck you.
Nothing.
Yeah Dude, why is Walter so pissed off?
Walter, how--
I'm going home, Donny.
I got eighteen dollars, Dude.
I'm shomer shabbas.
Walter, if you can't ride in a car, how d'you get around on Shammas--
They were Nazis, Dude?
Fuckin' A, man.  I got a rash. Fuckin' A, man.  I gotta tell ya Tony.
Fuck you man!  You don't like my fucking music, get your own fucking cab!
I'm not really, uh.
Hey, is this him with Nancy?
Far out.
I see.
Well, yeah I did, but I spent most of my time occupying various, um, administration buildings--
...Also, my rug was stolen.
I wouldn't know, Dude.  I deal in publishing, entertainment, political advocacy, and--
I FUCKEEN KILL JOR FUCKEEN CAR!
Relax, man!  No physical harm intended!
Jeffrey Lebowski.
Thank you.
Yes, I know about it.  And I know that you acted as courier.  And let me tell you something:  the whole thing stinks to high heaven.
I like it too.  It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex. It can be a natural, zesty enterprise. But unfortunately there are some people--it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women--who engage in it compulsively and without joy.
He fixes the cable?
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them. I asked my father about his withdrawal of a million dollars from the Foundation account and he told me about this "abduction", but I tell you it is preposterous.  This compulsive
I, uh... money, yeah, I gotta respecfully, 69 you know, tender my resignation on that matter, 'cause it looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.
Now I got--
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone that you're acquainted with.  You can't get away with it if the hostage knows who you are.
Do you still have that doctor's number?
Oh?
Well yes, what did you think this was all about?  Fun and games?
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?
Twenty grand.  And of course I still keep the rug.
What if it's during a game?
Huh?
It's your roll.
The ringer!  The ringer, Dude!  Have they called yet?
Well you're right, Dude, I got to thinking.  I got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand--
Dude, nothing is fucked.  Come on. You're being very unDude.  They'll call back.  Look, she kidnapped her--
Yeah.  That's a great plan, Walter. That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.  That's a Swiss fucking watch.
Your wheel, Dude!  I'm rolling out!
That's right, Dude, 1  % certain--
Yeah yeah, "kill that poor woman."
Hmm.  Well, we were in a handicapped spot.  It, uh, it was probably towed.
But Walter--
They're gonna kill her, Walter, and then they're gonna kill me--
Now Dude--
Huh?
No, I'm--
The In-and-Out Burger is on Camrose.
Not exactly a lightweight.
Well it's, sometimes the cathartic, uh.
Yeah?
You thought Bunny'd been kidnapped and you could use it as a pretext to make some money disappear.  All you needed was a sap to pin it on, and you'd just met me.  You thought, hey, a deadbeat, a loser, someone the square community won't give a shit about.
WALTER, FOR CHRIST'S SAKE!  HE'S CRIPPLED!  PUT HIM DOWN!
He can't walk, Walter!
Hey, cool it Walter.
Come on, Walter!.
It's uh, it's down there somewhere. Lemme take another look.
I understand sir.  Could you slide your shorts down please?
You told Brandt on the phone, he told me.  So where do I fit in?
Where's the money, Lebowski?
This is not Nam.  This is bowling. There are rules.
A world of pain.
You're missing the point.  Their vampire victims don't die.  They turn.  They become carriers.  If the Reapers continue unchecked, there could be thousands of them before the month is over.  Do the math.
Minutes.
If that's true, what about Nomak?  He's been alive longer than the others.
Like cancer with a purpose.
It doesn't have to be like that.  We don't have to be enemies.
If that's true, then why'd you save me?
I want to see the sun rise.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Sounds like a plan.
These guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain.  They're going to fuck us the first chance they get.
I'll show you.
We'll split into three units.  First team that makes contact wins the prize. Try to maintain radio silence from here on out.
Blood...
Look, I care about the humans who are dying, not you, got it?
I should think that would be obvious at this point.
Ultra-rapid detox.  They use it on heroin addicts, make 'em go cold-turkey in one night.
He wants us to know he's hunting us now.
Nomak said something to Blade in Greek. Athelfiki singenia ex amato.  Where did he learn that?
Two so far.
As scripted?  You've already lost two of your own.  How many more are you willing to sacrifice?
Fuck yeah.  Whole package'll crank this betty up another three-hundred horsepower.
Yeah, but you didn't have the Scudster working on it, did you?
Just do it, old man.
Wait.
Maybe I don't see it that way.
Frost!!!
I'm sorry, I --
Not anymore. You've seen one of them. You won't be allowed to live after that.
He didn't. Get over it.
He's a familiar. A human who works for the vampires. See this mark?
Why in God's name would anyone want to work for them?
There is no cure.
What do you see here?
Those aren't real memories. No one has that kind of recall.
If you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? I've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.
Your mother sounds like a Hallmark greeting card.
I'm not leaving without you.
You're a week early.
Then what is it?
This is purely professional curiosity, Karen, I swear.
No problem.
Study him. Unlock the secrets of his DNA. He's the key we've been looking for.
Please. You and the other Elders wouldn't know what to do with these texts if your lives depended on it.  Which, of course, they do.
Perhaps.
Why? Because we live at another species' expense? Your people farm cattle and veal, don't they? Fattening them up with steroids? It's called evolution, Doctor. Survival of the fittest.
You've been bitten by a vampire. We've got to try and burn out the venom, just like a rattlesnake bite --
Some of the old wives' tales are true -- they're severely allergic to silver, various types of wood. Feed them garlic and they'll go into anaphylactic shock --
What happens if he doesn't take the serum?
Because it means the tree is older than the house.
A coward too. That's why she had to go.
Closer.
--my God, Nick???
Yes.
Only thing I'm feeling is homicidal.
So whoever built this--
We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
That's a joke?
I haven't killed any--
It's like traveling back in time.
--whatever; that's her.
What is <u>this</u>?
I want to see the tapes.
No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
Get your goddamn--
--Cotter's--
--you should get back into bed.
--fuck your bullshit pieties! You were the next to die, asshole!
You have to go.
Both. Now.
Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
I've got the Panasonic Portable DVD player.
No.
Butt-ugly owl.
I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
My room, asleep, last I checked.
--Domini!
No one ever comes here.
--a Wiccan--
No problem, just give us 'til dawn and we're gone.
All I need--
No one's been in or out since you left. Would've heard the dogs.
Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
I thought the movie was bitchin'.
No. I don't think so.
--and we brought it back with us!
It touched me, don't you see it now?
They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
--a <u>lot</u>.
--it's not a could've--there <u>was</u>, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here <u>with</u> us in this place <u>now</u>. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our <u>brains</u>.
That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
You're needed here--keep watching--
I thought all witches were benign and good.
--the Sheriff's Office--
--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
What happened to my Dad??
I am?
Yeah.
Your husband.
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
I just gotta see a guy.
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
I couldn't believe it either...
...I don't know if you can fire a psychiatrist, exactly.
Abby--
I said you're bad.
I cleaned it all up, but that ain't important...
In the trunk.
I think someone's watching.
Remy.
I own the place.
Ever durned one.
...Friday?
See, I never knew that.
I don't know. Motel... Abby--
Abby, I like you, but it's no point starting anything now.
Yeah, don't come by here any more. If I need you again I know which rock to turn over.
For the money.
Go down to Corpus for a few days. Get yourself noticed. I'll give you a call when it's done... You just find a way to cover that money.
Of course.
How would I know?
You said the usual--
No, you do, cowboy. You been to the bar?
You shouldn't have taken the money...
What's that?
You we telling me about the Ring of Fire.
Tuesday.
Aunt Barbara. I'll try not to get depressed.
Sometimes it helps to talk things over. for instance, many marriages are saved by.
Certainly Frank.  Darling, get some glasses. We'll have some beer with Frank. Won't you sit down?
Shit. let's drink to something else. let's drink to fuckin'. Say here's to your fuck Frank.
Right Ben. LET'S GO FUCK. I'll fuck anything that moves.
Sure I do. I understand he's in the hospital. How is he?
I understand. I'm just real curious like you said.
Yes I have - so bad I wouldn't poison your mind by telling you.
Blue. It's Blue Velvet.
Okay. I gotta tell you. I've. discovered some things. .Anyway I have to show you some pictures and tell you some things about them. The first picture is this.
I have no hard proof of any of this. Her address is also on the photos. I think these people are involved with drugs. and murder. I think Frank is killing drug dealers and.  . and somehow Frank is getting all their drugs. I had to tell you I got slightly more involved in this than you wanted me to, but it's over now for sure. .I had to tell you about these things in case it could help.
Yes sir.
We're ten minutes away and moving as fast as we can.
Oh my God. Is her son OK?
He's a friend. from the neighborhood. we were just talking.
If you want to.
Alright, suit yourself.
'Cause he's comin' back, that's what for. Frank's got you really loaded tonight.
No way. get out. I'm gonna tell Frank. I'm gonna tell him what you said.
Yeah.
Jeffrey nothing.
You can kiss them if you want. Fell them . They're getting hard.
Yes, I like you.
Please don't talk like that. You're upset. I'm not helping you. I'm sorry for what I did. I better go.
Who's it, you mean.
Take it easy. What's goin' on anyway?. Why are you in so much trouble?
No.
Don?. Are you in with them?
Who are you? Maybe I'll need to. you like me, huh?
Hello.
Frank is coming?
Sure I do.
No. I told you. I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you. I think I know some of what is happening to you.  . Dorothy? Frank has your husband and son. Dorothy? Doesn't he? You have to do something Dorothy. go to the police.
Beeeee careful.
Just get outta my bed.
I did. are you?
Why are you here?  Hmmmmmmmm!!!! Ok.
It's okay. it's okay.
They hurt his head.
Don?. Where is he?
Yeah. I sure know that. Yeah, but how many more are out there?
Yes.
You were pretty popular. Didn't you run for some office?
That's too bad.
I don't really know much but bits and pieces . I hear things. My room is right above my father's office. The ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. That's direct from the Coroner's Office. The person is unknown. There are a couple of cases I get mixed up on, but I think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. I heard some of the same names.
Maybe so.
Not really, why?  You want to see the building?. Come on, I'll show you.
Still, it must be kinda rough.
I don't know. he moved away.
Yeah. Good bye.
Ooooo, you are smart. Just don't get too smart.
Settle down. I have a plan which I think will work. There is very little for you to do, but I do need your help. .Aren't you curious about my plan?
Right out in the car I happen to have some old overalls and a bug spraying rig. I will go to her apartment and be the pest control man. I will spray her apartment. After a few minutes you will knock on her door, drawing her attention away from me and I will then jimmy a window.
First of all, we'll have a nice dinner. Try to find out where Dorothy sings.
Great. I'll pick you up around eight o'clock. Is that good?
First of all, we're going to the Slow Club to see Dorothy Vallens. We'll watch her for awhile. I'd like to hear her sing anyway, and then also we'll know she is there and not in her apartment.
Then we'll drive back to her apartment and I will plant myself there.
That sounds good.
I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
Well. I've found out some things. nothing really for certain. There are some strange people involved.
No way. I'm about to blow up.
. OK. It's a strange world, Sandy. this is what I have found out. What I think I have found out. Dorothy Vallens is married to a man named Don. they have a son. I think the son and the husband have been kidnapped by a man named Frank who has now cut off both of Don's ears. I think he is holding them to make her do things for him. I think she wants to die. the ears were for her a warning to stay alive. there is another man involved. I call him the "yellow man". you saw his back the other day in the hall at her door. I don't know what he does but I think he's on drugs supplied by Frank. Frank is a very dangerous man.
I don't see how I can. and I can't prove any of this. I got all this information illegally. also it could get you in trouble.
Why are there people like Frank. Why is there so much trouble in this world.?
I guess so. you want to help me watch Frank?. I'm going to stake out Frank's place tomorrow. with a camera.
Number one. I saw the Yellow Man go into Frank's building, laughing with Frank. Now. the only trouble is. what does this prove?
Jeffrey!!
What is it?
Where to?
Let's wait for some slow one.
Frank!!
No. Is Detective Gordon going to be at your house?
Go ahead.
Go ahead!
No Jeffrey!!
Yeah. I just saw him outside. Maybe the robins are here.
uh uh.
uh uh.
It's good to see you, Dad.
Hey Jeff. I'm feelin' so much better.
Jeffrey, when you see your father.
Looks like you'd make a good runner.
I mean, you don't exactly have the build for a football. I mean. no offense.
Later Mike. I gotta take care of someone who's hurt here, in case you haven't noticed.
Really, he'll be home soon, would you like a cup of coffee?
Yeah. okay.
You can change it if you want to.
Sure. just a sec.  Excuse me.
Where do you guys want to count?
What plane?  We going someplace?  Where we headed?  You have your money.  It's all there.  What the fuck is going on?
My pleasure, Augusto.  Diego has told me much about you.
That's impossible.  We can't be up and running.  Who's distributing?
Thanks.  I am.  Where's Martha?
Derek!
What is?
You'll see for yourself.
Are you kidding?
Relax, baby.  We're going to wind up like us.
Which brings me to rule number three: which says, fuck rules one and two, skip bail and take off.
Something about vengance being best served cold.
What details?  I put the coke in the false bottoms and take it through customs.
What?  Yeah, sure.
My clothes, your clothes.  What does it matter?
It's a lousy fifteen kilos.  I piss fifteen kilos.
Diego needs to see you right away, please.  Excuse us, Amorcito.
It's your grass.
You're kidding, right?  That's a hundred pounds a week.
It's already been negotiated.  It's done.  The money is there waiting.
You guys are such babies.  You want to go home, go.  Me, I'm not going to stop until I find the fucking motherlode.
Nice doing business with you, George.
Yeah.  I understand.  Just business. Right.  Fuck you.
It's in the past.  I'm out of the business now, so forget about it.  No hard feelings.  We need to move on.  And besides, I'm sorry, too.
I don't want to talk about it.
Nothing.  Just a little project.
Twenty-six months?  For murder?  I must be your lawyer.
Only two ways I know to leave here early.  One is to escape.
Because I got caught.
I don't know, Diego.  I've got a good thing going already.  Everybody smokes pot.  It's easy.  Cocaine is a rich man's drug.  It's too expensive.
Yes.  And a kilo of coca is smaller than a kilo of your precious marijuana. Everything is the same, George, except instead of thousands, you are making millions.
And what happens when these guys stop paying?  Sooner or later, these guys are going to cut us out.  Then where are we?
Jesus Christ, Diego, where are you? It's been eleven days and these guys want their fucking money.
Try the closet.
Everything is not alright.  I bring you in, and you slap my fucking face!
Es un Ford blanco junto a una pick-up.
What?
George, don't be so emotional.  This is business.  Besides, I can't kill you, you are my brother.
Coke.
I don't know.  Maybe eighteen grams.
The boy is happy, Fred.  Don't be such a killjoy.
Take your boots off.  You're tan.
You mean the drug money?  Yes, I got it.
Oh, I see.
Actually, it was three.
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Yes, sir.  As much as you can give me.
Power?
Yeah, well...
I didn't come here to drink scotch.
You're saying life will take care of Diego?
Yeah, well, what are you gonna do?  You and me, Pablo?  Are we good?
That's too bad.  You would have been the first one in the family.
Alright.  You want me to get your old job back?  Because I could, you know, I could put in that word.
I'm going to California.
You loved her, didn't you?  You really loved her.
Tough spot.
Let me tell you something, son.  You would have been great at anything.
Yeah, Dad.  I'm happy right now.
Yeah, I know.  This is it, isn't it?
That was a good one, Dad.  That was really something.  Remember that?
That was a beautiful message.
What about him?
Holy shit, Dulli.  What the hell are you doing here?
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
She did that before.
My problem?  We're broke, that's my fucking problem.  And you're a fucking spy.
Yeah, well.  I'm working on that.  I've got something going.
Yeah, you will.  Of course.
Well, I got a call from Pablo.  He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down.  His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
Are we gonna split up?
Yeah.
Swear on my life.
Shhhh.
Shortly after I arrived at Danbury Federal Correctional Institute I related to Diego that the crime I was in for was smuggling marijuana. Diego told me he had high level connections in Colombia and they needed to find someone to help them transport cocaine into America...
Sounds fine.  I'll need to meet everybody.
Yes, I am.
Yeah, but what are you doing out here?
This calls for a joint.  You want to do the honors?
Relax.  I've flown with my old man a million times.  And he always told me, the taking off part is easy, it's the landing you've got to worry about.
And you believe the NLF?
And here?
And those who explode bombs in public places, do they perhaps respect the law? When you asked that question to Ben M'Hidi, remember what he said? No, gentlemen, believe me, it is a vicious circle. And we could discuss the problem for hours without reaching any conclusions. Because the problem does not lie here. The problem is: the NLF wants us to leave Algeria and we want to remain. Now, it seems to me that, despite varying shades of opinion, you all agree that we must remain. When the rebellion first began, there were not even shades of opinion. All the newspapers, even the left-wing ones wanted the rebellion suppressed. And we were sent here for this very reason. And we are neither madmen nor sadists, gentlemen. Those who call us fascists today, forget the contribution that many of us made to the Resistance. Those who call us Nazis, do not know that among us there are survivors of Dachau and Buchenwald. We are soldiers and our only duty is to win. Therefore, to be precise, I would now like to ask you a question: Should France remain in Algeria? If you answer "yes," then you must accept all the necessary consequences.
Second district ...
Uh ... responsible for the sixth section.
I'll explain.
Then don't complain.
No, it's better if he doesn't. The house is filled with new people.
Men have two faces: one that laughs and one that cries ...
Yes ... yes. The problem also involves the UN. I don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the UN the possibility of evaluating our strength.
Intersection, between Consular Street and General Laquiere Avenue ...
Good evening, sir.
A name?
She says that Ali is still in the Casbah.
Fine, Charlie.  You familiar with the Marsh case?
I just wanted to introduce myself and inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.
Had to.  I also interviewed three women who were in past relationships with Marsh.  There's no evidence that he had anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.
Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the scene?
A massive cardiac arrest.
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand.  It was filled with water and cocaine.  Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death.  I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
Counsel approach the bench.
Marsh left her close to three million dollars in his will.  That's motive. She admits to being there the night of his death.  That's opportunity -- and her fingerprints are on the nasal spray bottle.
Because she's clever.  Because she knows that even if we didn't find it we'd have suspicions as to why a man in Marsh's condition would use cocaine.
We're going all the way on this one, Frank.  Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for murder two -- fifteen to twenty five.
Really?  What does an attorney speak to his client about at her house until three o'clock in the morning?
The State's investigation just uncovered Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
Yes.
She left me.
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could.  She called it opening new doors.
What did she say?
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her.  My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that.  You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her.  How deeply you want to please her.  At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built.    Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop.  Eventually I started to have trouble breathing.  Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster.  No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
Yes -- Insulin and others.
Cocaine.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
No further questions.
No.
We dated for about a month last year.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
No.
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving.  That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights.  Incredible stress.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love?  That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him.  That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
Well, think about it.  Isn't it possible?
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
You didn't know about it before that?
Sorry.
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
I don't know.  That's why I'm asking you.
I'll have you out in a few hours.
Sure.  Where to?
Hi.  It's Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
It's okay.
It won't be that hard.
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
What would?
Is that what you think I was thinking?
I went out on the boat.
Are you scared?
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
That's crazy.
Yeah.
I love you too, Dad.
-- But it's Sunday.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities."  Who told you to say that?
I am relaxing.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
We're supposed to go to the lake.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
Yes.
I'll talk to him later.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
It was a place to start.
Daddy -- stop it!
No -- never.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
No treasure maps, huh?
Aw, Betty.
No. You can have them.
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Come here a minute.
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested... 
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
Was this during Betty?
Did we want to?
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
No. What a tragedy. What happened?
Oh, honey. I'm so sorry. But you've got to be grateful for even feeling the little you've be given. Believe me. Go to him. Don't let him leave without these new precious hours you've got left. And if you need anyone to cry on, you know where I am.
No, of course not. I'll just clean up.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
No.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
Clean?
I feel so embarrassed.
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
No.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Yes, that'd be nice.
No. I can't. Not yet.
How about Bari?
Why?
Near the church.
What?
Well, what is this?
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
No one's asking you to!
What about us? What about me?
But now that you have it -
Yes. And I've accepted.
Nah.
What's her name?
They're not going to find her!
Cremated?!
It's the only way.  It's possible your father may not be dead yet.
He yours, sir?
Alright.  Yes sir.  Anything you say.
Maurice, man, shut the fuck up.
Saw Bones ol' Bones on top of the hill. Rolling fat jays outta hundred dollar bills.
That's the only way we'll get the place fixed up in time.
Let's get going.  Go home, pick up what we need, then crash here.
Maurice left.  Tia's taking a bath.
Probably stoned out of his gourd in some corner.
Dad, the man has been lying to us for a hundred years.  I mean, where is my forty acres and a mule?
Wh-wh-whooo?
What it will be.
Just try it.
I've got what I want.  Turn around baby, look at me.  Look at your man.
What?
Hush, baby.
Nothing but net?  Could be a swish.  Or a muthafucking air ball.
That's your dream, Homes.  Not mine.  I don't want to leave this street.  Ever. The status quo is totally cool with me.
Aw that's easy.  I want my life back. Can you swing that, my brother?
I don't want you meeting around that house.  You stay away from those kids. And away from that dog.
Who was he, Momma?  He tried to kill us.
I don't.  Patrick doesn't.  And his brother and sister don't.  And they're in the house with him.
No we won't, Momma.  I'll just have them call and tell Patrick it's us.
Naw.  But they will be.  They're the best.
My old man calls the shots.  He built that gate and these damn walls.
Bill!  Bill?!
Okay, okay.  Listen:
Back here.  At the end of the block.
You got the shit?
Let me see it.
That's the past.  It's dead.
Dad?
You cut him, or I shoot you.  Make your choice.
I ain't killed nobody.  Shall I rack 'em?  Play a game, Lupe?
You was just doing your job.
Shit, that was fast.
But --
Whattaya think?  Can you picture it? Over there the bar, and in here -- the dance floor.
The Gangster of Love don't eat no fried chicken.
That building?
Evidence of what?
What we have to do is call the police.
I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.
Two point one seventy-six.
All right!  Where's the key?
The same way you did before.
Ask Johnnie!  Ask your rat-fuck son!
I'm sorry.  It was an accident.
There's no time.
What are you, drunk?
Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
Don't tell him --
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
You need the money just like we do.
Everything you couldn't.
Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Shut up!
I'm listening.
Yes, I understand.
Sure, Gino, sure.
No.
Hey, Mickey.
What?  They ain't there?
Okay.  Let me call around.  I'll see what I can do.  Don't go anywhere, okay?
Yeah, that's it.
Ssh!  I can't hear Gino!
All right.
...  thank you.
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
No, it isn't your fault.  The walls here are just so thin.
That is so amazing.  I'm in awe of people who can fix things.  My dad was like that.  We never had anything new.  Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work.  His hands were magic.
No.  Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it.  I did it.
...  yes.
I'm already in your bed.
Nothing.
Shit, here we go.
Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men?
For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember?
Do you think you know me like that?
Yeah.
Not much, really.  Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment.  |The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
Waiting in the apartment next door.
Not Caesar.
What happened?
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
I'm here, aren't I?
Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves.
Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident.
I told you, the family doesn't want the police around.  We want to take care of it ourselves and we will. I'll find him.  I swear I will.
I don't know what we're talking about.
I thought you were never going to do that.
I'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.
-- if we can get a clean shot --
What do you want to do?
So it's time to go home.
Jason...  They can't let you go...
MPG Capital.
Yes.  I mean, I think so.  Yes.  Yes...
Right.
Right.  Yes.  Of course.
Really.
Excuse me?
Get me out of here.  <u>Please</u>.
I won't hurt you.
Then I'll find another ride.
I was shot twice in the back.
I fought my way out of an embassy. I climbed down a fifty-foot wall -- I went out the window and I was doing it -- I just did it.  I knew how to do it.
I can't believe I slept.
Thanks for the ride.
Nah...  With you, I mean, you'd probably just forget about me, right?
-- he's got my picture! -- this is yesterday! -- this is me! --  -- where did you get my picture? --
Marie -- look at me -- there's no time for this --
It's a name.  Mr. Wombosi owns a thirty million dollar yacht.  He's the proud owner of an Alliance Security package.  He also paid a visit to the morgue to see John Michael Kane.

I'm gonna find the end of this.  I can't protect you.
Think I could rent a scooter?
Enhance it.
-- yes, sir, it's confirmed --
How did I get here?
I don't know.
I won't forget this.
Uh - what? - I ...
Thank you.
Machines don't fix themselves.
Got there!
Then perhaps you can help me. I've lost someone who ...
I understand this concern on behalf of the tax-payers. People want value for money and a cost-effective service.
Mr Helpmann. I've changed my mind. I'd like to accept the transfer - am I too late?
Sam, if you've been going out there and playing a straight bat, all the way down the line, you've got absolutely nothing to worry about.
Even later.
Really? - God, how time flies!
Thanks. Are you officer 412/L?
Not much.
So how ...?
You didn't know as much about this business as you pretended to, did you?
Barbara's a perfectly good name, isn't it?
Right! Just between as and the Security Forces.
Do you know what you're doing.
Sam ... we're proud to have you at Information Retrieval. Merry Xmas. 
You want Information Adjustments. Different department.
If you say so.
Ah.
Oh, sorry.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
Suit me?
Well, all wars do -
Every day?
You're joking.
"And your children all gone."
Are you still following me?
Go away.
Don't do anything silly.
You don't exist any more. I've killed you. Jill Layton is dead.
It's not our mistake!
I've told you before. I'd turn it down.
Next of kin!
Well, that's it! I may as well go and hang myself! This sort of thing couldn't have happened before the stupid seventh tier reorganization! That was Simmons doing! And he and Jeffries always sit together at lunch! The bastards!  Ow!  Perhaps we can lose it ... behind the filing cabinet ... or destroy it ... burn it ... eat it ...
Here.
You are good to me Sam.
Yes.
All information on 3rd Level Suspects is classified.
All enquiries to Information Retrieval. Which is hopeless, of course. They never tell you anything. But come the time they want something from us ...
It's what you wanted isn't it?
Sorry, a bit busy at the moment.  You seem to have quite a lot to do yourself. 
She didn't say anything about it to me.
I'm sorry but ...
I'm sorry Alma, I didn't mean to sound so ...
This isn't rare!
Mother!
I'm sorry. I don' t want dessert. I don't want promotion. I don't want anything.
Yes he is - he wants to talk to you.
Er ... I assure you Mrs Buttle, the Ministry is always very scrupulous about following up and eradicating error. If you have any complaints which you'd like to make, I'd be more than happy to send you the appropriate forms.
He hadn't done anything ... He was good ... What have you done with his body?
I ... uh ...
I think that'll hold it.  Hello Shirley. Just helping someone tie up a Christmas present. How are you?
Thank you for calling Cen -
Thirtieth floor, sir. You're expected.
No, sir.
No need, sir
No you couldn't, sir. This is Information Retrieval.  the lift's arrived, sir.
I'm glad to see the Ministry's continuing its tradition of recruiting the brightest and best, sir.
Monsieur. Quel numero.
Have you got one or haven't you?
Emergency procedures.
What is it?
The paperwork, couldn't stand the paperwork.  Over to the left please, if you don't mind sir. Hold it there. Yes, there's more bits of paper in Central Services than bits of pipe - read this, fill in that, hand in the other - listen, this old system of yours could be on fire and I couldn't even turn on the kitchen tap without filling in a 27B/6.... Bloody paperwork.
Why? I came into this game for adventure - go anywhere, travel light, get in, get out, wherever there's trouble, a man alone. Now they've got the whole country sectioned of and you can't move without a form. I'm the last of a breed. Ah ha! Found it!  There's your problem.
No. But I can bypass it with one of these
Time to go.
On the house. You did me a favor. Check the corridor.
I'm sick. That's what I've been telling you.
You know they won't do it. It's up to you. You gotta be strong.
No ...
Pregnant.
He looks like a cop.
Mary said you might be coming.
Mary, we really have to go.
Did you give Mary something called Red Death?
You're going to live.
She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
What's his name?
What'd you mean IB Bangin? What kind of name is IB Bangin?
Oh man, Bucky.
I know him. That's Noel.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
You never know.
At least he's got people around him.
Go home. Take her home. Get some rest. Not going to find anything out now.
It's okay. They're prescription.  Works better with a little whiskey.
She should go home.
I was just going to get some food. Pizza. Maybe we could.
I grew up on Elizabeth. I went to Blessed Sacrament.
We moved out after that. Upstate.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up.  I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that.  Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
We can still go back. I'll walk you home. You sleep a couple of hours, watch some TV, take a bath.
No, no.
Frank.
The ghosts--
Make a left here. I want to stop.
She's the daughter of a cardiac arrest I brought in last night. I told her we'd give her a ride back to Misery. Her father's showing signs of improving.
Thanks.
What about rule number three: Don't get involved with dispatchers named Love.
That's too many.
It's coming.
Here's to the greatest job in the world.
Crazy fucker.
Upstairs. 212. Had to shock him twice more.
How can that be? He was getting better.
Look out!
I feel the need, the need for speed. I'm driving out of myself.
I've taken that into consideration.
As long as we keep moving. No standing still.
You need a reason, Frank. You don't just go around breaking people's windows. That's anarchy.
Frank!
I eat. I just haven't had coffee yet.
It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
You have no sick time, Frank. No time of any kind. Everyone knows that.
You sure?
No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
Same old stuff.  I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
Yes, Aaron.  I know the names of the Cabinet.
Oh, God, no!
Why?  What did they do to you?
Yes.  And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
No.  I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
Are you any closer to a decision?
Yes.
Yes.
Office Bimbo.  No, I'm sorry.
Eleven and a half.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
I didn't know you were going with him.
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
I lost six pounds...
I'm not kidding.
I don't know.  At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny.  My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway.  And I'm chipper because you finally showed up.  I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
This isn't friendship.
Stop.  Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help.  My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland.  The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks.  Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Well -- my wife got this new job...
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war.  He...
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you.  Just on superficial performance things.
No.  I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
Yes.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
Right there, Bobbie.
Bobbie, please.
I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight.  You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.  Honestly.  Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
One's enough.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
That's okay.
Okay.
Hey, okay.  Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
No.  They're firing even more people than they said.  Some will want to talk.  It could help.
Okay, that's your opinion.  I don't agree.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
Yes, sure.
Uh-huh.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Yes.
Billion.
Excited.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
Uh-uh.
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
You keep coming after me and looking down on me.  It's starting to make me batty.
You want to come?
Go ahead -- what?
Boy, that's nice...I wish we could all deal with each other like this. I'll check it.  Anything I can do for you?
I'm not knocking it.  It's a great solution.  Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
I'm sorry.
Oh yeah?
Yes.  Fifty dollars an hour, right?
What, right now?
Shh!
Oh it's enough...
What!
Anything new?
Alright I got you, man.  It's my turn for freak patrol.
Righto.
Yeah it was all just an accident.
It wasn't easy.
Oh...
Here here...
Yes Walter.
Tell us what you're going to make next, Walter.
Don't you see Carla?  I made them immortal.
Do you have to be so cold to him?
Yes...I'm uh...I'm fine.
Abstract?  With his talent for realism?
I was just looking at Carla's picture.
I didn't buy it I made it.
Well it sure looks dead enough.
You want me to buy Dead Cat?  It'll scare people away.
I didn't mean to.
I don't have another cat!
Well, I mean it could have been something else, but it just worked out that way.
You want me to open a window or something?
N-no!  Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
Well, w-what did you do?
You're like an undercover guy!
C-connection?
Yeah yeah yeah - look!  I've heard this song and dance before, save your breath, you're coming with me! Lou goes to turn Walter against the wall but Walter springs back -
Walter shut up and relax!
I liked it very much Mr. Brock. I liked it very much.
No thanks.  Sounds good though.
Here here!
Why not?
T-turned on?
I can't.  I gotta go home.
Well why don't you clean up this dump!
What's the matter with you!
Not as single-minded as the others, not as sybaritic.  Almost thoughtful. She's useless.
Stay away from my thang.  Sorry, honey.  'Thing.'
Let's move out!
He's got a...  What do you call it? A Napoleonic Code.
Oh, yeah.  But I still want to know what happens.
That's it, man.  That's the whole story.
Amazing!
Get away from here.
You don't mean, like, a cheerleader?
My bike!  She's a lesbian, too. She told me.
Hi, guys.
Guys.  Guys!  Reality pulled out of her five minutes ago.
I just want to see the basketball scores.  It's important.
I went to sleep.  I think I have the flu or something.
So I noticed.
I'm out of here.  Jenny.
No...
I am so sure.
Water.  Okay.
Yeah, I was bailing.  I have a friend, and he's really... well, he's really vampire, I guess.  Bad scene.
Thanks.  Tomorrow morning, I'm on a bus.  I'm gone.
It's nothing.  It doesn't hurt.
I'll back that up.
I know.
For the dance.
I should have known.
Are you nuts, Buffy?  There's a hundred of them out there.  They'll rip us apart.
'One that reflects the students' growing awareness of and involvement in the world around them.'
Okay, guys, how about the ozone layer?
Like my homework.
Why don't we see a movie?
Wait!
Yes.
Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
In Virginia.
I have to show you.
She --
All right.
I have cheerleading squad.
Do you know what a Vampire-King is?
We'll cover it later.
I tell you, the best thing I can do right now is find out more about you.  What your strengths are, your likes...  Everything.  What's your best subject?
Yes, you used to do gymnastics. But you stopped.  Why?
Two days ago, would you have even hit me?  Let alone so powerfully?
Exactly.  You're changing.  You're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.
No.  No bats, no flying.  They... float, occasionally.  Not really flying.
Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
Don't start with me again.
I...
Not if you're careful.
I can't work this.
Okay.  The important thing is not to panic.
I kind of had to improvise.  Sorry about your guitar.
Make time, okay?  You're the one who told me to act normal.  I've missed three practices already.  If I'm not there for the Barber game tomorrow everyone's gonna talk.
Try and be inconspicuous, okay? Act like a fan.
You got a C-plus?  I can't believe I cheated off you.
Cassandra's really smart.
Nicole...
Really?
I don't understand.
I'm just a girl.
Could be.
Could be.
Okay, what else?
But --
Where'd you learn how to do that?
Throw it out.
Okay.
Buffy?
Nee sitch.  No way.
Snapped.  Buffy was, you know, on the upswing, and I swear to God she went across the room.  Perm over heels.
Well, that's the thing.  She landed on her feet.  Didn't even sprain a toe.  And I go up to her and she turns and looks at me and she's like this --
Okay.
Right!
Seriously, Buffy.  That look was way twisted.  What were you thinking about?
Hey, have you seen Benny lately?
What?
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
A little better.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
No, no, it was great.
I know what it is.
I did.
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
You don't have to...
That's great!
I think I'm ready for the Show.
That's my job too.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
You got me all confused.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous?  How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Yeah...you a witch?
What?
He'll learn.
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
You spit on me!
Shake off the pitch.  Throw what you wanta.
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
Gimme that.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem.  You got a gift.
You been in the Majors?
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"!  You wanta step outside!
Go for it.
Yep.  He really crushed that dinger, didn't he.  Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
Then go.
Fear and ignorance.
'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh.  The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
Pussy.
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
See ya at the yard, Meat.
We're getting married.
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
League record.  And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records--  Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
I'm Joe Riggins.  Sit down
Even if it's the Carolina League-- this is a chance to play everyday.
This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in.
You were never my guest?!
He's lying.
Yes, you were.
Philip, if you would rise.
But what happens when they do find out?
It's a pity in this...
The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run!
They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere.
Excuse me.
...I will let her in the house for five minutes if you gentlemen will escort her out if she happens not to want to leave. Because I don't - I -
Not bad, not bad. In fact, uh, my wife's pregnant again.
You fuckin' piece of shit.
Hello.
So, once she signs those papers, she'll be the only person to have total access to the box?  No one else, including myself?
Well...
I don't know.
Ginger.
You mean, I have your permission?
Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky?  Nicky was the muscle.
To begin, I put money out on the streets, chargin' three points a week. You know - juice to the fuckin' dealers.
I'm sorry about this. Really.
Between...
Why, somebody's complaining?
Nope, there's no way.
In so many words, yes.
Hey, Rich.
It's impossible. It's booked up, and you gotta make a reservation.  It's...
Well, back home they don't know about fuckin' control. That looks bad.
Yeah?
The coppers blamed me for everything that went wrong out here, and I mean every little fuckin' thing too.
No, a...
Yeah, I said I - let the bullshit blow over for a while so I can run the casino. Anything goes wrong with the casino, it's my ass. It's not yours, it's my ass.
What are you -
And what'd she want?
Sammy.
It's me.
Yeah? Well, listen, Ginger's over here at the Leaning Tower with me.
Yeah, she's here.
I want to just talk. I want to talk to that Irish bitch.
Yeah, I heard a lot about you.
I think you're way out of line talkin' to me like that. What you're sayin' is libelous, and you're in no position to challenge my expertise. I went way out of my way to be very helpful and courteous to that kid. He's weak, he's incompetent. He jeopardizes the whole place. There's not much more I can do for him.
Well, it's a little too early. I'd say Thursday would be good. I'll know by then. Is that all right?
I'll come by.
Seven o'clock.
They were ready to blame him for anything, no matter where it happened.
All right, we're clear.
Next morning bright and early, I get the call.
Yeah, refill'd be great.
Ace, listen to me.
I...
'Mr Rothstein' is good enough.
No. Just stop everything.
...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room...
We can't get rid of him?
Who's this?
Okay. 
Ginger's mission in life was money.
I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother.
Yeah, I know all that.
I - I - I...
No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that.
Okay.
It's nice isn't it?
But as much as they loved her...
Yeah.
No, he didn't.
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here.  I am.
I don't need one.
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Pretty serious.
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
You hate my guts? I want you to come with me now.
Get out of here!
And where'd you go?
Okay. I want you to call Jennifer and I want you to tell her to tell you what she had for lunch, and I'm gonna listen in on the other line.
You know why I want to do it. Just do it.
Who were you with?
I know you were with somebody. Who was it?  I just hope it's not someone who I think it might be.  I just hope it's not them.
And what? And let you disgrace me, you fuckin' pig? And let you disgrace me?  Get up. Get up and be a mother. Get in the car and go to the house...
I wouldn't do that...
Get the fu-  You threatening me?  I'll fuckin' kill you in this place!  Get up and go home right now.
You're gonna be sorry if you don't stop that.
Let me in the house! Fucker!
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
What are they doin' way back there? Bring 'em up here where they belong. You can't even see 'em over there.
Listen to me very carefully. There are three ways of doing things around here. The right way, the wrong way, and the way I do it. You understand?
So, you're a righty?
Get out of here.
I didn't give 'em the m-
Thanks, Nick.
You shut up.
Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on?
But how much cash could I bury in my closet, right?
I mean, you will try to push it through, won't you, Mr Clark?
Hi. Good.
You can't talk to me like...
I understand.
That's not a problem, that's not a p-
...fuckin' jerk-off.
Yeah. Fuck him.
We're waiting on Carmine.
Carmine's gone.
I'll take care of it, Remo.
Yeah, I heard, yeah.
I'll tell him, Remo.
It's private... but I want you to tell me the truth.
No. I ain't see anything like that.
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
You're so nice. 
Nothin'.
Yeah?
He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that.
Yes, you are.
Come on. Don't be scared.
A sponsor.
All right. Be careful.
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
But I saw something...
What's the matter?
Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me.
No, Lester.
Okay, then.
Uh, talk to you later.  Bye. 
Lester - he called you here.
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
It's this bullshit. It's just bullshit right here. This is the fuckin' problem, you know.
You're driving me nuts!
Listen...
Are they out now?
God, I'm telling you, they're out!
Boy, look at this place, huh?
All right.
Two.
You know why, right?
'Cause you're a jag-off. I would have fuckin' made you lay ten...
You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'?
Get up.
What, are you gonna have a fuckin' meeting here, or are you gonna buy some diamonds?
Pleasure.
It's up to you.
Fuckin' Jews stick together, don't they?
Well, now, sure they're askin'. They earn with the prick. I got a funny feelin' he's gonna start a fuckin' war or somethin'.  I'm not sure yet, you know. But I w- You know, but you know what I want you to do?
Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out!
Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right?
Fuck you, you motherfuck!
What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'.
I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'.
Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right.  Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need...
That's a good one, dude. He says we're going to kill you whether you tell us where the disc is or not.
Kincaid got a little frisky last night...So, meet here at eight and go from there?  By the way, I'm Brock Leviathan.
What did you think?
You're very special. Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I feel very strongly about you...forgive me use of architecture metaphors, but I instantly know a good foundation when I see one..
Uh Brock, today you are without me...
What did you say?  Selina, sit down, the entire city is going crazy...You have to just calm down...
We'll hunt him down together...
I lied.
They do take their time. So..Selina Kyle...
Quiet, Blender Boy. I told you from the beginning, Selina, I'm not a very good liar. I am not Captain God, or whatever else he may be calling himself this month, but when I find out who is--The Man will pay.  My sister died in that Museum attack. You can check the Atlanta obituaries. I've tracked these monsters from city to city, waiting for a time to exact my revenge. Why else would I come to Oasisburg and create the most obnoxious casino in the world?
I guess we did. When you were a little boy, did you want to be a superhero?
Oh come on, Cactus, be a man!  The blimp is still on schedule, right?
At this point, a nap. Oh by the way, I killed your butler and your dog..
I've been thinking. I've been thinking about us. I'm sorry I've been so hard no you these past couple days. I realize now it's because you're the only woman who ever understood me and I couldn't handle it!  I've never revealed myself to anyone the way I have to you. Let's blow this town together.  We'll run a bed-and-breakfast in Vermont by day, and by night, we'll dress up and kill anything that...
I don't know what I was saying. I totally phoned it in last night. I haven't been getting a lot of sleep lately...
What did you say?
Yeah...pretty gross. Hurry, we've got work to do.
I got her...
Absolutely.
I hate it when you get like this. This Catwoman is becoming an obsession. I say we call it a night. Tomorrow is a big day for us...
Just like a woman. You want out. You're out.
I know.
Oh please, sir, one more. Are you the reporter or the architect?
Do you have any idea how much superheroes get paid?  Zilcho. Urban vigilantes with secret identities operating outside the law. Not exactly the stuff of a W-2 form.  If it wasn't for merchandising and corruption and these diabolical "missions"...There is no such thing as heroes and villains, anymore, Selina.  There are only winners and losers. You lost. We won.
Men, huh?
You Career girls have no idea what we go through.
"Pre-bicentennial babe?"
Can I be frank, Frank?  Your entire existence is sexual harassment. I accept there's not much you can do about it.
What is it with women and Catwoman? Men have the courtesy to punish the weak, but women love punishing the strong. Don't get me wrong--this Catwoman is a terrifying, subversive menace to everything this community stands for and she must be stopped. It's just, I like her a lot.
Well. I'd let you come in, but the place is a mess...
Not too cool...
"I'll go out with you." Now go get me these old newspapers...
Yes, Mother. Dear.
You going to talk all day?
Do I hear a woman's voice?
Taking messages.
I won't let him.  He belongs to me now.  Bye, sweetie.
I'll explain later.  I'm sort of on hold.
You could've made me lose my call.
I didn't hurt you.
Theo wants to talk again.
See for yourself, federal agent, U.S. Treasury.  On the job.
Or relieve me of it later.
I want the gun emptied.  I want to see all six slugs tossed up here. And then I want out.  That's all. <u>OUT</u>!
Look, I've got a wife.  I don't care if either of you ever get caught.
Just like they say; no fucking self control.
Shit.  There's the hotel.  You overshot the driveway.
I improved on the fucking original.
Sure -- and they record your voice.  And later on we all get slammed for kidnap and murder. That's out!
We'll toss it when we make the blind curve.
I was worried about you.  Both of you.
You don't understand.
You may be our only chance.  I don't know if I can do this again.
They smashed the phone.  I've been clicking the loose wires together hoping it'd make a connection.
They're holding my husband downstairs.
My name is Lenore Oberfeld.
No!  No police.  They'll know right away the authorities are looking for us.  They'll kill us. We've seen their faces.
They just walked out.  The smaller man -- he must be Dominican or Haitian -- he kicked me so hard. I felt a rib crack but I never made a sound.  It's starting to hurt now -- real bad.  A throbbing.  I can't even take a deep breath.
Rachel!  They're going after Rachel now -- and I can't stop them.
Let me call the school -- tell them not to let her go.
Even if I got there first she wouldn't go with me.
Forget about us.  Just save Rachel.
I didn't mean to open up any old wounds.
That makes two of us.
I've lost you.  You're gone.  I can't hear anything.
She's gone --
I'm trying to.
It's not your fault, Theo.  You tried.
Even if you found us -- what then?
I'm not supposed to -- but I do. Millions in cash and bearer bonds.
To hide it from the I.R.S.
But I guess we haven't really met -- have we?
When they first started questioning Jack -- he answered them in that tone he usually reserves for me.  And they began beating him.  And I watched.  And I didn't feel anything ... What kind of a person am I?
I had a little encounter at the bank and our Mr. Transplant ended up under the wheels of a Chevy.
You're all three of you in that van?
Put the man back on.
Why can't it be her?
They tortured us.  And you're going to let them have all that money?
They put their hands all over me.
Hand me the phone.
There's no way out for you.  You have to deal with us.
A typical fuck-up.
Inform him the fee is seventy-five large for your return.  All parts intact.
Ask them.
The money, Nels ... ?
I was sentenced to a youth camp out here when I was fourteen.  We cleared some of these same roads.
The cop in the trunk -- he could still be alive.
We can't leave him to repeat anything.
Only one way to find out.
That's not good enough.
You won't live to see it.
Toss them -- one at a time.  I don't want to lose count.
Didn't we play this scene before?
I'm afraid I've used up all my good deeds for the day.
I'm self employed.  What kind of cut did the hairy one have?
Fine.  I want half.  Plus the release of the family.
You're up on your details, aren't you?
There are no guarantees in this life.
Some loyalty.
I'm not accepting criticism today. Now don't make me lose count. There's already a half million in this portfolio.
My pleasure --
You pull up -- collect your first installment.  Then you let the daughter go.  When she reaches me, I'll dump out another third.  Same action.  I back up again -- you pull forward.  Satisfy yourself it's there.  Then we do it one last time.  The final exchange. And we go our separate ways.
Are you trying to panic the women?
I'm tying it up in a bundle now. Where is she?
Put the girl on.
The fuck I will!
And I end up in a fucking neck brace for life!
Nels!  Guess who?  A friendly voice from beyond the grave.
Take the 405 south.
Following which we will have a serious question and answer session with your girlfriend.
Only you <u>don't</u> have a flat.
Where is this canyon house where you're supposed to hook up?
See what, Dil?
Yeah?
Nice.
What would you call it?
Hi, Jimmy.
I would expect he does.
Hi.
Charming.
Don't throw my clothes out the window!
Yeah. I heard. You hear, Jimmy?
He wants to know do I mean that.
It's a simple question.
Not in my experience.
Bloody right I do...
Scottish?
They all get the wrong idea.
Yes, thank you.
You can't leave me then, can you?
Jesus fucking Christ.
Yes...
Like you're concerned.
Is this an obsession of yours?
He did sometimes.
Depends what it is.
I have to talk to her, Col --
You mean that?
That's a start.
Ask to meet me again.
Know what, honey?
Absolutely.
Don't be cruel.
Okay.
Kind of.
I'm not sure.
Afraid so.
No. Sit down.
A girl has to draw the line somewhere --
Yes.
Look on it like a honeymoon.
Only in times of extreme stress.
You knew which man?
I suppose I tried.
Don't you want to kill me?
He asked me to see were you all right.
Let me go, Dil
Love you, Dil.
Anything.
It's my name, Dil --
I asked you a question, honey -- were you there too --
And she used her tits and that cute little ass to get him, didn't she?
Tell me what she wore.
Don't call me that --
Absolutely. The younger the better. Doesn't come your way much, I suppose.
Well, maybe you'll get lucky. Someday.
A girl has to have a bit of glamour.
My pleasure.
Suits you.
What do you mean?
No way, Jude. I'm out.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
And what if you don't?
Request permission to take the hood off, Tommy.
And anyway, he's seen our faces.
Because tomorrow we might have to shoot him, that's why.
I understand.
Doesn't matter who he is. He is what we would call a legitimate target.
Good. So what do you think?
Nope. Not handsome at all.
So I've noticed.
They're going to let that guy die. And you're going to kill me.
Okay. That nice lady. Meets me in a bar. I'm saying what the fuck am I doing here anyway. She buys me a drink. She holds my hand. I'm looking at her saying I don't like you, bitch. But what the fuck. Maybe I'll get to understand.
How different?
Shut up, would you?
Having a pint in the Rock.
I've often wondered how you do it.
It's as simple as that?
No. Not bad. Women are trouble, you know that, Fergus?
Want you to do something, Fergus.
If they kill me --
How can I?
Stop that talk now --
You don't know me, do you?
You didn't?
People. They could be looking.
Thought you liked me, bitch.
He's a good soldier, Jude.
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
I love you, Adam.
Can you remember anything at all?
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
You mean spies and things like that?
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
Thanks very much.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
But --
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
Agents.
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Next, please.
Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
Okay -- up there.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
I'll take that.
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Who?
I'm sorry.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Shut the door!
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
I don't believe it.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
I was expecting you. You are American too, of course.
How much is it worth?
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now?
And if it is?
Meaning what?
Nachurly. And that goes for Herman, too.
The kid said --
Leave me alone -- !
But his mother --
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
I don't know.
A letter? May I see it?
Is that all? Can I go now?
And this?
Why, do you think we're going to?
No, you see, I don't really love him.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Starting tonight?
Having a nervous breakdown.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
How do you shave in there?
How about once more around the park?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
Good night.
Be careful, Peter.
I don't know.  Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
I believe what he said.
Words can hurt very much.
Please stop -- please!
Yes, ma'am. A little one -- 'bout seven or eight years old. Th' little tyke keeps callin' you his Aunt Reggie -- ain't that cute?
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
Who invited you?
We want that money -- now!
Me too. I'm going to start telling people that I saw her drop to her knees and latch on to his unit vector.
WOULD that impress you? IS that what it takes to impress the empress?
Not my imports.
Why not? You worried you might find out how much she actually knows?
Calm down Brent.
Hi Daddy. Hi Mr. Sisler.
You never went, uh, all the way?
Never mind darling. You go back to school. I don't want you missing anymore classes today.
No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
You know where I can find her?
I never met the woman. I'm just taking care of the place until they sell it.
No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
Yeah. You should check downstairs.
People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
I'm sure you should have failed.
Of course I'm scared.
I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
But you can't do any of it. So it sucks. I always have to 'set an example'.
Does she fuck?
I was desperate. It was gross.
Maybe I should blister through a bottle of Tequila and just fuck his brains out.
I keep a couple of my dad's porno books hidden in my desk for emergency reference.
There will be a lot fewer by tomorrow night.
FINE. Are you?
You're thinking of sleeping with Mark tonight?
No.
So? You're already late. A few more minutes won't matter.
Fuck your curfew. Most sixth graders can stay out later than you.
I did.
I'm so flattered but I can't. I'm grounded.
Sharon's far from a slut.
He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here!
Yes?
No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
Whoever tried to kill me was made up to look exactly like this picture of Lisa Sherman, clothes and all. I think that concerns me.
The word is Mob.
The men. Do any of them still live around here?
You're not telling me something.
Who was the fourth?
Did you want one?
They're tasty.
Maybe you better just drive me home.
Yes. Unfair to me.
Sam?  Andy gave Sam a nice big desk to park his fat ass behind.
Hey, I'm with you on that one, my man. Prick.


Andy.  Another fuckin'...
Hey, you and I are seein' eye to eye on a whole range of issues this mornin'. 
Except for the fact that I need cash.
...off.  Say, uh, three seventy-five. Seein' that we both have so much love...
Dude in uniform get in your face, you do not shoot your mouth off.
...and a shitload of ice.

You want cash?
No.
Hey, you're gonna piss me--  What the hell are you supposed to be...
Are you kiddin'?
You'd better coast through...

...-er.
Borrowed.
Okay, okay! 
You're nuts, goin' back there!

Hi--!  The gun was empty!
Well, then, that means it's call...
...man!

...Pete!  Come on!  There it...
All right, you got it.
  Oh, we're screwed, Night...

Come on!
 Oh...
Come on.
...Pete!  Come on.
...Night Shift, but you might...
...you crazy bastard.
Whoo!
 Gee, you think so?
 ...shit!
 
Oh, shit.  It's okay.  Okay. 
I'm crazy?

This river's fed by a glacier.  Willing to bet my life that it's a good deal under fifty degrees.
Hey, you didn't happen to lock the truck up when you got out...
You're fucked, man.
...stole the truck.
...piece of shit was worth.
Like I said, I got a pretty good idea of what's at stake here.
Even though it is nice to see Andy...
Are you all right?

We're gonna die!
 Come on!
Okay.  All right, man.  Okay.

Okay.
Tunnel.
What?

It's working.

Look out.
Why'd you stay behind?!
They aren't exactly gonna publicize this,  Arlo. 
...I feel that my government owes me a little restitution.
What about all that "no need to get in the man's...
Look.  That's negotiating? He threatened to kill...
But he didn't.  See, that's negotiation.
That's bullshit.
 big balls.
To tell you the truth, we're looking for a scientist who's gone missing from the Tech Center.  Maybe you know him. Richard Long.
I don't ever wanna see another ice cream...
...help you?
  Hey, actually...
...-lem too?
Bullshit.  Put the phone down, Mason.
...on ice!  We've got Elvis on ice!

Any of them Richard Long?
If you're right, Lewis, this Mason is one hell of a pro.  He must have a service record and a paper trail some-...
You know, captain, if you hadn't spent so much of your career questioning your superiors, you might've found yourself with more gold leaf on your col-...
...destroyer of worlds."
No!
There's nothing to say, doctor.  Someone had to take the fall, and they still need you, whereas...I've never been anything more than a thorn in their collective side, as you once said.
You look good, Richard.
Is that why you're here?  To blame...
Together, you gave me the opportunity to realize just how very wrong my life had gone.
Do you think I haven't seen the bodies of those...
...I began trying to find ways of controlling the effects of the weapon that we tested on Horn Island.
Forget about him.
And I certainly can't say it's pleasant.

Like I say, Doc Long's...
Then meet me at the dam in fifteen minutes.

It won't be long, gentlemen.




Where's Elvis?!


You'd never understand!
Darlene, it's five-thirty.  Now, I worked late for you this mornin', and you didn't wanna spring for over-...

Secrets.
You got thirty minutes.
Go.
Couldn't sleep, Pumper.  Is everything, uh, all right tonight?

We don't have an hour.  We're already supposed to be shut down.
Yeah, yeah...
Yeah.

Who's the investigating officer?
Do you know him?
Where from?
Of course, but you've got no reason to think he's bungled the case?
Mainly that you're rich and too respectable to want your name in the papers.
His girlfriend?
You mean the little chippie he was with at the El Macando?
Yeah.
When was the last time?
I'll look into it as soon as I check out some avocado groves.
Just incorporate the Valley into the city so the water goes to L.A. after all. It's very simple.
At your daughter's house. How soon can you get here?
Just bring your checkbook.
You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
Thanks. You know something, Jake?
You bet your ass you don't. You can't even pay me off.
Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
How'd you get past the guards?
Uh-huh. So what are you doing here?
Who?
Didn't you call?
You accusing me of extortion?
Well, I hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, Lou.
Shut up.  Go on.
What for?
Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
I guess not.
But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
Well yes.
I don't think so, Mrs. Mulwray. Of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.
I said I'll drop it.
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Well, how much would you like?
How did you find out?
Did he know?
No. I'm just a snoop.
No, not for that one.
Been meaning to talk to you about that.
Money. How they plan to make it by emptying the reservoirs, that I don't know.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
No.
And Hollis knew about it?
They can't be.
What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
You can't always tell what's going on there.
Please!... Trust me this much...  I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
He owns it. You know?
That's not what it looks like, Mrs. Mulwray.
Because of Hollis? Because she was seeing your husband? Was that it? Jesus Christ, say something. Was that it?
...That's not what I meant.
I'm all right.
He's in the dark room.
What'd you expect? That's his job.
When did you come in?
Nothing to do with Dad. It's me, actually.
Of course.
We don't reveal the names of our guests as a matter of policy. I know you'd appreciate that if your father came to live with us.
I don't think so. Be happy to show you.
J.J. Gittes. And it's not a departmental matter.
Maybe he takes it very seriously.
Hope so. He's working for us.
Only when I breathe.
Well, look at it this way, Mr. Yelburton.  Mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. Then he found out that you were dumping water every night. Then he was drowned.
Nothin', Morty, it's my lunch hour, I thought I'd drop by and see who died lately.
Drowned, too.
Yeah, under Hollenbeck Bridge, what's wrong with that?
Who?
Mr. Gittes...
Yeah, I'll do that.
Well I'm on my lunch hour. I'll wait.
I take a long lunch. All day sometimes.
I don't want Mulvihill.  I want the big boys that are making the payoffs.
No, you have a press agent do it.
She ain't exactly long in the tooth now.
You must be thinking of a different daughter.
We missed the best of it, didn't we, pal?
So I can have these? 
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film. 
Then why don't you change jobs? 
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story.  Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier  'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him... 
We'll talk about that later.
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
It's not true! No! It's not true!!! I'll show you he's coming back!
I rather like it myself.  Send it right away.
Two cents.
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
I can't take shorthand, Mr. Kane -
These'll be kept.  I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly.  I will also provide them -
You don't really think so?
Well, why don't you, Mr. Bernstein? You know Mr. Leland.
That's a long story.
And the social.  How about the music notice?  You got that in?
Nobody else, but I've been through that stuff of Walter Thatcher's. That journal of his -
I guess Mr. Kane didn't think so well of Susie's art anyway.
It didn't end very well, did it?
I wanted him to have fun - and with me along -
Yes.
I'm all right, Mr. Leland.  Only there was some fellows out front that thought they ought to take things up with me.  I learned 'em! Didn't I, officer?
Go and get yourself washed up, Mr. Bernstein.  There doesn't seem to be an serious injury.
Mr. Kane is finishing it.
Mr. Kane is finishing your piece the way you started it.
I don't my plans myself.
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter.  The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
Really, Mr. Kane, I can't see the function of a respectable newspaper -
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
We've got a nice plant here.
Has he said when he'll finish?
Chicago is pretty close to New York nowadays - only twenty hours -
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him.  And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
He's paying for it, Emily.  Those returns tonight - he's finished. Politically -  - socially, everywhere, I guess. I don't know about the papers, but -
I don't think so.  Are you coming, Charles?
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago.  You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.  Come on, Charles.
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
You are.  You look like you've been making mud pies.
You're no Venus de Milo.
No.  But you're close.
You really don't know who I am?
Pretty old.  I'll be twenty-two in August.
Oh, no!  Nothing like that.  Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me.  Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
Half past eleven.
I was referring to myself.  I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight.  Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
You're in a tent, darling.  You're not at home.  And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
Susan!
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President!  I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
Thanks.
Your mother won't be going right away, Charles -
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
They're all part of your general attack - your senseless attack - on everything and everybody who's got more than ten cents in his pocket. They're -
All right.
Do you know what that is?
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Yes?
Go ahead.
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you -  Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
She's going to leave you -
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
Yes.
Mr. Leland sent back that check.
It was for twenty-five thousand dollars.
Rogers isn't even pretending.  He isn't just scared anymore.  He's sick.  Frank Norris told me last night he hasn't known Rogers to be that worried in twenty-five years.
You won't be lonely, Charles...
You don't happen to have a cigar, do you?  I've got a young physician - must remember to ask to see his license - the odds are a hundred to one he hasn't got one - who thinks I'm going to stop smoking...  I changed the subject, didn't I?  Dear, dear!  What a disagreeable old man I've become.  You want to know what I think of Charlie Kane?  Well - I suppose he has some private sort of greatness. But he kept it to himself.  He never - gave himself away -  He never gave anything away.  He just - left you a tip.  He had a generous mind.  I don't suppose anybody ever had so many opinions.  That was because he had the power to express them, and Charlie lived on power and the excitement of using it -  But he didn't believe in anything except Charlie Kane.  He never had a conviction in his life.  I guess he died without one -  That must have been pretty unpleasant.  Of course, a lot of us check out with no special conviction about death.  But we do know what we're leaving ... we believe in something.  You're absolutely sure you haven't got a cigar?
Never mind -  Bernstein told you about the first days at the office, didn't he?  Well, Charlie was a bad newspaper man even then.  He entertained his readers, but he never told them the truth.
It's a letter from her lawyers.
That must have been love.
Ask the question anyway, Thompson! Build the picture around the question, even if you can't answer it.
Yes, sir.
Queer?
He married you, didn't he?
Rosebud?
What is this, a poll?
Do you mind if I drink this here?
You want me to leave? Why? Because somebody is telling it like it is? Somebody's giving these fine people a wake-up call?!
Exactly.
He went home to change for the big date.
I went back there, and Dante was already waiting for me.
No, don't!
Dante. You've got a customer.
I can't believe you're here.
Very dramatic, I thought.
Were you going to tell me or just send me an invitation?
How do you know that?
So you're really getting married?
Thanks for the vote of confidence.
What?
Jesus, you're caustic.
Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing.
I'm just kidding.
I'll ask Randal to close up for me when he gets back.
It wasn't me.
Was it you?
Nobody. It was closed.
We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away.
I can pass!
I can whip your ass.
Give me a stick, pretty boy! I'll knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.

Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later.
What do you two fight about?
That's cheating?
You, Veronica, Caitlin...  ...and Caitlin's fiancé.
Blasphemy.
All right, Vader's boss...
Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.
Basically.
All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?
He said he has to find a perfect dozen.
I'll give him five more minutes then I'm calling the cops. I don't need this, man. I'm not even supposed to be here today.
Can we talk about this later?
How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?
Let's hear it.
Can you believe this?!
Sorry.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve?
Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four.
I'm going with you.
You just closed the store to play hockey on the roof!
Bible truth.
No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.
I never tried it.
So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something!
Exactly.
I don't; you did.
I swear. I couldn't make this kind of hell up.
Because I'm happy.
I'm not. She just left.
I'm not.
No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.
Shut the fuck up!
WOULD YOU SHUT THE FUCK UP?  WHO THE FUCK IS IN THE BATHROOM?
What are you talking about?
Leave me alone.
Jesus H. Christ, I can't!
Point is-I'm not the kind of person that disrupts things in order to shit comfortably.
Which means the video store is ostensibly closed.
Unless you're out renting videos at other video stores.
Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you... you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.
I don't have love handles.
You remember Alyssa Jones? She hung out with...
Jesus Christ, what next?
What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body.
Yeah?
I'm not dealing.
It's not my store.
So.
I can't believe you just rolled a joint in here.
I don't know. I wasn't watching.
We were going to start again, I think.
I'm trying.
Rough, eh? Oh, that stuff rips hell out of my hemorrhoids. Say, would you mind if I took a roll of the soft stuff back there. I see you sell the soft stuff.
I'm not even supposed to be here today!
The guy got sick and couldn't come in.
Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep!
Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now?
Who's defensive?  Just... Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.
Why do you say that?
Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.
Three including you.
I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
After dropping a bombshell like that, you owe me. Big.
Sylvan made it up. It's a blow job thing.
Yeah. How do you think I know he liked...
Please calm down.
Lower your voice!
Um. Thirty-seven.
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne.
At least he wasn't thirty-six.
I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now!
I don't want Caitlin...
I don't want to go back with her...
Veronica, I love you...
Can I have your name please?
An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours.  It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
He's moving to the big city next week. He wants to be a metal singer.
I don't know. I can't really tell from here.
My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy.
Your ruse. Your cunning attempt to trick me.
You're gonna be at John K's party?
Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory.
Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante.  I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave.
Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight?
You came for that too? That's the movie I came for.
Says who?
Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape.
Twenty bucks.
Ronnie! How are you? You work here now?
Do you still talk to Sylvan?
More bang for the buck.
Where's the radio?
A bad climb, no, just another challenge.  What's life without 'em, right, Agent Travers.
No, stay off the line!  You'll break her loose!
I was with Jessie, she filled me in.
When we get this group down, I'm gone.
And you weren't looking into her eyes when she fell.  Now drop it!
Would you?
Give him the money.
Not on that leg.
That's it, you look like a professional.
Patience my love, patience.
Wait, I think I have them sighted.  What's the word, Frank?
Don't say that.  You'll embarrass Frank.
Did I?  I don't know.  Maybe I shouldn't have gone out on that line.  Maybe I panicked.
I don't expect you to understand.
You couldn't.
Why are you yelling?
Flare up of old emotions...
No, I think I will, it's safer. I have patience.
He doesn't want my help.
He can handle it.
You got to go back now!
Excuse me?
Of course I do.
Get it!
I don't know.  I don't know.
Hand-holds?!  I can barely see them.
RUN, DAMMIT!!
I burned it.
Ryan, get a rope, I want the man on a leash, too.
The best he can since you gave him nothing.
No, he's gone.
We're not animals, but don't force us to be.  Walk over.
I'm touched.  Kristel, check the chopper, let's go.
What are you talking about?
Tucker and Walker.
It looks like a winding route.
Then it's a deal.
On my way.  The cases are hooked up and ready.
Somehow I didn't think you'd wait for me if I'd sent it first.
Let's move your ass in there!!
I haven't even got on it yet.  Let's go, time to fetch.
Then go fetch.
Hey, you dealt us this hand, we're playing it all the way. Move.
No, that son-of-a-bitch Walker is alive.
A nozh scrap any time you say. Dim weakens.
You bastards... bastards.
And you, sir?
Thank you, sir.
Who are they, sir?
How do you do, sir?
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the Police tonight.
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir? Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself clear?
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to snuff it.
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we pull a mansize crast.
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst thou in thy mind have? Confrontation. Georgie backs down.
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. Girl bows and exits to loud applause.
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because you are helping us.
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about compensation for the victim.
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe to get out, now can we?
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.
Right carry on. Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather. One ten penny piece. One white metal wristlet watch, "Timawrist" on a white metal expanding bracelet. Anything else in your pockets?
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!
How're you feeling this morning?
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't understand why, how what.
Fine. Fine.
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos. Slide of watch shop.
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read the meter. Slide of bird's nest with eggs.
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?
Yes.
Good. I'm glad
Oh, thankyou, your honour. The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can trouble young men deprived of the society of women.
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man.
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.
Prison custody?
Very good, Chief. Chief Guard turns to Alex.
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.
What?
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Different instrument altogether.  You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
You psychic?
Just had one.
Sure thing.
Max?  Oh...  ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
It doesn't matter!  Just get out of the goddamn building...
In my office?
Seventh, files section.  What should I do?
Max, I'm scared.  Are you sure?
You heard Armstrong play live.  I've never been this jealous.  You get to talk to him?
Fella owned this place back then, Dix Dwyer, he let slip to Louis that I played.  So Pops, he just waves me right up.  My heart about stopped. But I got up there all the same, and we played for nearly twenty minutes.
I never lie.  Ask Max.  Max, have I lied yet?
Can't say that I do.
I think...  ...I think you should get this gun out of my fucking face.
Wouldn't dream of it.
Pretty quiet down there.  A cab just pulled up, aside from that...
...Petrov and Cicerno for sure...
So?
No.  Your cabbie is floating down a storm drain or stuffed in the trunk of a cab.
Oh, we working for the Feds now?  If my snitch flew out a window, he's got Dmitri's handprints on his ass. That makes it homicide, that makes it ours.
Oh?
Pick me up in five minutes.
Not our call, Phil.
What happens if you don't?
Who the hell is this?
...well, last I checked, you were <u>sleeping</u> with me, so unless you wanna start fucking the guy soon, I'd suggest an attitude shift...
You share it with over three million people every day.  You know that's the population of New Zealand?  What's Manhattan, thirteen miles long? That's a lot of misery crammed into thirteen miles.  Read about this one guy.  Gets on the subway and dies.  Six hours he's riding around before anybody notices. Think about that.  Here's this corpse doing laps around Manhattan courtesy of the New York transit system, people getting on and off, sitting next to him, and still nobody catches on. Three million.  That's too damn many people.
You mean like benefits?
Yeah.  Lucky with the lights.
Two, two-fifty.
You always stutter?
You're cool.
Yeah.
...and you promise you'll never tell anybody about this, right?  Get in the fucking car.
Yes!  I'm trying, I swear!
How can you kill him like that?
You don't know the guy in the trunk, either.  If it makes you feel better, he was a villain involved in a Continuing Criminal Enterprise.
I'll deal with it.  I will, I will...
Why?
It was an accident.  I'm not liable.
I need the job.
What?
I don't understand...
You mind?  I'm working here.
Leave me alone.
<u>I don't wanna know you!</u>
Oh, I'm captivated.
You'd do her a favor.
She hears what she wants to hear, okay?
Yeah?  What happened?
What happened?
See, I've got bills.  My mother's been dying of the same disease since I was a kid.
Why?
Makes two of us.
Tribeca, near the waterfront, northeast corner.  Twelve minutes.
I only owe you a ride, Vincent.
That cop!  Why'd you have to do that?  You couldn't wound him?  The guy had a family, maybe, parents, kids who gotta grow up without a dad, he was probably a good guy; and he believed me...
Yeah, so, what's wrong with that?
What happened to you?
Man, if someone had a gun to your head and said:  "You gotta tell me what's goin' on with that person over there or I'll kill you"...they'd have to kill you...  'Cause you don't have a clue for...or about...anyone...  To be like that, I don't think you, you have any of that for your own life...  Do you believe you're entitled or at least expect to draw breath in the a.m.?  Open your eyes in the morning?  I don't think you do...I don't think so...  I think you are way <u>low</u>...like in your estimation.  In your estimation of yourself.  So how'd you get that way...?
None of your business.
Slow down.
What are you gonna do, pull the trigger?  Kill us?  Go ahead, man! <u>Shoot</u>...my ass.
Guy came in with a gunshot wound, but he died of a heart attack.  Go figure.
Not testing.  <u>Using</u>.  Nukes are passe.  This is the weapon of the future.
I can't promise you anything.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Sure.  You switched the charts, didn't you?
For what?
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
Do they have a secret handshake?
I'm not sure.  I think I figured something out.  It must've been in my newsletter.
Flesh wound.  No big deal.
Can you prove any of this?
Just five.  It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
What van?
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Realized what?
So now they feed us terrorists. <u>To create fear</u>.  How much do you think an airport security system goes for?  Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Latest casualty?  Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
A water main broke.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
This way.
You go.  Send me a postcard.
He gave it to me.
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
I spent two years here.  This used to bring the med-cart.  Demerol. Phenobarb.  It's Jacob's Ladder.
Now she tells me.
You've never seen her run.
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
Well, I don't know if --
I don't know...
Alright.  You can see her.  But she can't see you.
It was my dog.  Let me ask you a question.  How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
You've asked me that one three times.
Excuse me?
We're very specialized.
Yes, that's right.
I know the story.  A federal judge.  He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
I don't understand.
Working.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
This doesn't make sense.
It's his show for now.  Look, you want to get some dinner?  Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
You think we have time to fool around like this?  Come on.
I don't think so.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Okay, fine, they've got the primes -- but if you're right about there being another more significant transmission still to come --
How is that possible?  How could all that information be encoded in --
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity.  There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
What if you're wrong?  No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
No, thanks.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
David --
With me.
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil?  This is absurd, David.  We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Interesting analogy.  And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
Maybe they are.  Maybe this is all part of the package.  The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale.  Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
This... seemed best.
Good luck, David.
What would you have me say, David?
It could be anything.  The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
How soon will you be able to decode it?
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists.  If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
In ancient times when parchment was in short supply people would write over old writing... it was called a palimpsest.
We've repeated.  A few minutes ago the message cycled back to page one.
I don't know.  Maybe there is a fourth layer in there somewhere, but if there is, I sure as hell can't find it.
Been there, done that, got the T-shirt.
Kent, Kent for Chrissakes.  You must be Eleanor.
It's a civilian facility.
It's incredibly rich.  We've been cataloging it in frames or 'pages'; right now we're on 10,413.
You don't seem to understand that it's your interests I'm trying to protect -- !
Is that your official response?
Big enough radio, I don't see why not.
I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you, sweetheart.
The librarian... or the library...?
I find it convenient to keep my interests... mobile.  Anyway, I've had my fill of life on the ground. After spending much of this century pursuing the evils and pleasures the world has to offer -- after outliving three wives and two children...  I find I've had quite enough of planet Earth.
I've had a long time to make enemies, Dr. Arroway.  There are many governments, business interests, even religious leaders who would like to see me disappear. And I will grant them their wish soon enough... But before I do, I wish to make a small contribution -- a final gesture of goodwill toward the people of this little planet who've given -- from whom I've taken so much.
It's so... small.
Can't.  Doctor's orders.  The low oxygen/zero gravity environment is the only thing keeping the cancer from eating me alive.  It's all right -- I like it here. Ever try sex in zero-G?
And?
Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this?  I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing.  You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.
Thirty-one linked dishes.  You could search more sky there in a day than you could in a year here.
Actually --
That is true.  But it's also true that if I really thought we wanted the same things, I'd follow you anywhere... but the truth is I don't think you want the company.  Be honest, El.  There's nowhere you'd rather be than sitting out at some remote corner of the world searching for the answers to the mysteries of the universe.  And call me crazy, but I just can't compete with that... I'm sorry.
You too.
Wait -- hold on a minute --
That's one way of putting it.  Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe.  Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --
That's not faith, it's physics.  The second law of thermodynamics.
Some of my best friends are scientists.  They're saying the machine is alive.
If you came back.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
It was quite a page turner.
I'm not sure it's come to that.
Have you seen what's happening out there?  The terror, the despair? The world is on fire, Ellie.  People need something they can believe in, something worthy, and you can give it to them!
Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said:  ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
Meaning...
Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor.  We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --
I got two years.
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
What are you doin' here?
Tried to live always just as free and aboveboard as you been, and well, they ain't that much elbow room.
Gotta go, Arletta.
Ram it in and break it off!
Yeah. Did you have them both at once or --
I know, I know. Just don't hit me.
Blue'll git him, Boss. We'll git that bastid, Cool Hand Luke.
I did three hitches in the Navy. It ain't bad. After a while, you get used to it and the time --
Borrowin'.
I'm dyin'. I'm dyin'.
Get away!
Mah baby! We're diggin' and dyin' but our boy Luke is lovin' and flyin'.
I didn't say nothin', Boss.
I just always did like truck rides.
Fifty's a nice round number.
Nothin' to worry about. We got a deadlock on that mullet.
We got it locked in the sock.
Yeah, well, you and Koko kin handle it without me.
On my own.
He's the champeen hog-gut of this camp. Hell, I seen him eat ten choc'lat bars and seven cold drinks in fifteen minutes. He kin eat busted bottles and rusty nails, any damn thing. If you'd so kindly oblige as to let me cut off your yankee head, he'd even eat that.
Forty-five.
Gettin' up, Carr.
Call.
Well, how far didya get?
A phoney? Whatta you mean, a phoney?
Hell, no. I ain't goin' down in the ditch.
Andy?  When a three-year-old says there's a monster under the bed, you don't say 'forget it'.  You look under the bad.  I'm three years old.  Call the prison.
Monsieur Andy can <u>smell</u> your coiffure.  And guess what else?
You talked to me.  Do you remember?
Inspector Halloran.  Homicide. You were supposed to contact a Peter Kurten?
Shut up -- I'm talking.  You got felony breaking and entering, burglary, felonious...
You get me out first.
What Friday?
I'm trying to tell you.  It's on the lady's pillow...
He told you she was loaded, any- thing you could steal you could keep, Conrad?  You bought yourself a return ticket to Quentin, breaking and entering.
She don't want it.
You come and visit.
Conrad has the phone number. Conrad, where is he?
I don't care -- she's a cop.  That's the important thing.  Cop-ness, not sex-ness.  It won't be perfect, but it'll be good.
That's not who I admire -- I admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...
I think this is number three...
Is he out?
If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush.  Now, I've done what you asked me.
Show what?  It's gone.  He wrote a self destruct virus into the code, so it would only play until we try to copy it.  Then it erased itself. Gone...  Do you remember what you saw?
Nobody knows you have anything to do with this case; nothing has been on TV or the news... Why would he want to get in <u>your</u> computer?
You're saying it's the same man, but he's changed his style?  That doesn't happen.  These men are robotic; the murder is like a ritual.  The method itself is part of the pleasure...
I turned it off.  It's like an open window he can climb right in...
That little Winona Ryder manner... you're more convincing as Clint Eastwood.
Who's going to catch him?  You?  And if you do, there'll be another one.  And one after that.
One of those goddamned car alarms. What's going...
He said to send you his regards and to tell you that the Bureau holds you in the highest esteem.
What does it matter?  This guy, you checked your course records, who signed up?
Look.  There's the order:  you wrote it:  DeSalvo, Bianchi & Buono, Berkowitz and Dahmer.  It's going to be Dahmer next.  Which means he'll kill a man.
W-We had a fight.  I called him... called him a name...
They never kill themselves.  How do you know it was him.  You never met him.  You never even saw a photograph...
No.  I'm shy and I'm selective.
I know, baby.  I know.
He wants me, he doesn't care about her.  Let me...
You got that right, Nikko, it's none of your business.
Yeah, you did that too.  You earned what you got; don't shit on it, that's all I'm saying.
I'm sure she thinks it is.  Aren't you at least interested in which one it is?
It's mostly done, they got nobody in common, the three of them... No mutual friends -- the Landlady says nobody was ever there, she never saw her with anybody.
Classy madonna.
Honest to God, Ruben!
Why would he send this to Helen Hudson...
Excuse me?  <u>Excuse me</u>?!  What do you...
Don't try to lie, Ruben.  You don't have the face for it.  I need you to help interrogate the burglar in Hudson's place...
I gotta get something to eat, I haven't eaten all day.
The same as the firs two. Definitely a serial.
That's always your privilege, sir.
What?  I talk like a cop, this is the way I talk.  I can't believe this guy.  Saks.  He's a Deputy Assistant Director of the F.B.I. "Let me help you!"
You're damn right I do.
Helen Hudson...
I gotta have Ruben, and a...
"Spokes<u>person</u>."
What's this about the Boston Strangler, M.J.?
Yes, I fed her.  If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you.  Again.
And her husband? What was he?
It is?
Are we imagining it?
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards.  I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
Serious. But you'll have to take your new friend, the female crash-test dummy. She dropped it off for you.
I live in my car. This is my workshop.
You're right, Ballard. There's an all- night car-wash in the airport service area.
I did this already.
What?
I apologize for the inconvenience, but I must ask you some...
I think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.
We'll see about adjusting the dosage if that doesn't clear in the next  How are other things going?
Well, Letty, this does present a liability issue for the hospital.
All I want you to do is think about what's best for you. Really think about it.
I'll talk to her, and to Dad, too.  A few wisely-chosen guilt tactics and they'll be ours.
Truly.
Paul, can you hand me the olives? Ruth, I need you to, what was it?
I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
Oh, no, of course not.
You don't have to make any decisions tonight.
I know.    I know.
I'll be running it three days a week, and...
Come on.
Wow.   Congratulations.
Especially with a promotion in the offing.
Can I get you a glass of champagne?
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
But what about Beast?   Who'll...?
I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask.
Don't be fresh.
It's OK. It's not a pass-fail kind of thing.
Terrific.
By color.
It's magic.
Enough with the abracadabra.
Good God.
I won't do your portion of kitchen cleanup.
Back-to-back sessions with the shrink.
Break up?    They wish.
I just want to see Beast.  Where would you go?
How can you even mention Spaghetti- O's after eating Grandma Rosa's dinner tonight?
Oh, right.     I'm ready.   How do I look?
I was brilliant, or at least boringly sane.
I've heard the mission in Santa Barbara is the place to go.
I like it.     But Headlines are better.
I'll be forced to tickle you.
Sounds grim.
You don't have to take care of me, you know.
Coming.
Always the drugs.
I saw you talking to my Mom.
I think I should call someone.
I guess so.
Someone has to take care of you right now, Michael. You tore up the apartment. You stopped taking your medications.
What do you want to do?
That's the best idea I've heard in a long time.
Oh, ok.   Maybe.
Sure. Of course.
You can get out of the dinner.
I'm going to the store.
That's a big question.
No.
He's a patient here.
I love him.
I start on Monday.
I do apologize.    A student had a crisis.
I'm glad you're doing well.
Do you know who this is?
You killed her!
Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
Then we just have to make sure everyone who knows can't say anything.
Not today.   Where are your friends?
Where did they go?
What?   This?
You're there now?
You're calling me on your cell phone, right?
My number's going to show up on his bill!
What?
-- I've got the tapes. If you ever want to see your brother out of jail do exactly what I say. Bring one million euros to your boat at six o'clock.
To tell you that we're interested in the property.
And nothing.     He's just feeling us out.
Supernumerary. It means better than expected.
You should. You can learn a lot about the criminal justice system on a program like that. Very informative. Stay and watch it with me.
He missed three weeks.
You have enough to worry about, Angelo. You don't need my problems.
I guess we're going to find out.
I don't think it will be a mystery much longer.
You want me to help you get out of the country?
Half the tapes.
I just want to get my people home. I know who you are and what you could do to me if I don't honor my word.
Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.
We can't.
We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
Cops?
And the Vodka.
I can't believe you didn't check.
It was an honest mistake. Ridgeway... Ridgeroad... Ridgeway Road.
Maybe if we gave the tapes back --
Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.
Good idea.
That's Frankie Zammito.   The Under boss of the Chicago Mafia.
I would have to say... pretty fuckin' bad. You gave us the wrong address Sophie.
He's been shot a lot.    He's used to it.
You haven't answered my question.
I'm leaving you with my friends. I'm trusting you to do the right thing today.
I ain't no rat.  You got money, right?
Fine.     Ten o'clock.
Hard to say.
Boy, you must be pissed.
Some French guy. At least that's what his passport said. You know Joey, I shouldn't be talking to you about this.
No. It's just that the French guy had a gunshot wound on his neck. So, this is a homicide. Are you guys involved in this?
A Wallet.    A hotel room card.    Some cash.
Yeah and if you turned it around it would say to go right.
I was told to take what we have and go.
Bastaldi got the address from you, yes?
I see.   A master criminal.
What kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?
Okay.    I will have a beer.
C'mon, get real, will you. You think he's just going to forget about this? These guys are all about respect. All about honor. He's coming after us, so we might as well take the money.
Yeah, but you did do it.   So let's deal with that.
She took everything!    Didn't even leave us cab fare.
This is the only American car you've ever driven.
I'm not going to leave you.
How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?
What are we going to do, take a taxi?
Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.
It's my idea.

Whatever! He never told me about the Van Gogh or any of the other paintings.
The hell it is.
Fuck me?   Fuck you!
Uh huh.
The papers for the car will arrive tomorrow.
I know where she went.
What?
I don't know.
Take a nap.
Something like that.
It's okay.   It was a long time ago.
It's three in the morning.    Not much else to do.
Stick around and find out.
She doesn't know. She thinks I fell down the stairs.
Wait!  I'm a friend!
I do as I please.
Like most things, I am nothing. It's the same for this sword.  All of it is simply a state of mind.
I'll never live as a thief!
Long.
Don't bother.
I've made you silk pajamas.  Do you want to change into them?
You're too young to understand.
Really?
Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.
So I heard.  Congratulations.  It's the most important step in a woman's life, isn't it?
How so?
Don't be a sore loser.  Go ahead. Take your pick.  I'll wait.  Go ahead.
Kneel!
It's mine.  It means a lot to me. A barbarian like you wouldn't understand.
Give me back my comb.
You must decide.  You might get tired of this life.  You might begin to miss your family.  If it were our daughter, we'd look for her too.  She would miss us.  Jen... I want you to be mine forever.  I will make my mark on the world.  I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend.  Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish.  Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped.  He didn't die.  He wasn't even hurt.  He floated away, far away, never to return.  He knew his wish had come true.  If you believe, it will happen.  The elders say, "A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
I will.
"A faithful heart makes wishes come true."
I left the training early.
During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared.  I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
Something I can't let go of.  You are leaving soon?
Perhaps.
You always suspected she'd fled to the West.
Be careful.  Sir Te requires discretion.  Official business is difficult enough.  Don't let personal feelings make it worse. And I don't know... even this poster... could be some sort of trap.
That's not what I meant.  I don't care about the sword.
Jade Fox drugged her.  How did you get here?
My life is departing.  I've only one breath left.
That's good.  Sometimes the help can't keep their hands to themselves. It's very embarassing.
A murderer?
We must avenge mother!
What does it say?
Sir Te!  It has brought him as much trouble as glory.  Help him to leave these troubles behind. Otherwise, he'll never be able to start anew.
Don't be coy.  I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.
When it comes to emotions, even great heroes can be idiots.  Tell me if Li Mu Bai is not more open the next time you see him.  I'll give him an earful!
This is a delicate matter.
What do you have in mind?
Was. ALBRECHT  This isn't Top Dollar's style anyway.  This was somebody else. Somebody new.
Annie, I need a file.
I knew that.
You gonna wind up working at a school crosswalk.   that doughnut's chocolate you, know.
Fucking A, my friend.
I saw it, too.
I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us?
Funboy had to leave this mortal coil.
I told you you're not supposed to come in here.
She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair.
I think he's yours, now.
And she'll be alive.  Up here.
Mom tried to cook.
I don't know you.
Last Halloween, eh?  Yeah...  Yeah, I remember.  I fucked her too, I think.
Victims.  Aren't we all.
Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you.
T-Bird?
I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now.
Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself.
Does it hurt?
Shelly?
Yes.
Go away.
I'm already alone.
This is a cobra, Mr. Grange.  Yes, it is real.
Extremely so.  You and I are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling The Crow.
I intend no slight to you, but I cannot find the English to adequately express just what he is.  I suppose Western mythology would describe him as a Fury.
Is he inside?
No shooting.
Bad news.  Alot of action on the streets tonight, and nobody bothered to clear it with me.  Tin- Tin got himself whacked.
Annette Harrison.
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
On my mother's life.
No.
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
It's not really important.
What'cha reading?
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
That's a matter of opinion.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Please.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
Refreshing.
It's my house.
No thank you.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
How was your date?
What are you doing?
Of Human Bondage.
I can't win with you.
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
No.
Where are you going?
I think that's for the best.
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Hi.
Yeah, me neither.
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
I'm sorry about that.
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Don't you raise your voice at me. Go to your room, now.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
Do you want to learn or not?
It was nothing.
Okay.
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Why?
It's Kathryn.
I... I don't think you want to know.
That's one way of looking at it.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
I swear.
Same time next week?
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Get out of here.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
I told you I don't know.
Racist piece of shit.
Don't worry about it. I'll stay.
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Sounds intriguing.
Shut up and turn to page 64.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
Shhh.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
I hate it too.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
What's your problem?
Morning.
Where'd she go?
Kind of.
Oh yes.
I've never done this before.
I have a flair for drama.
I accept. Now get out.
That's beautiful.
Like your step-brother Sebastian. I can't believe they didn't expel him after what he did to the school nurse.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Annette! Annette!
I did?
Nope.
I can't have you do that, nor can I have you hanging around the lobby all day.
You're a lucky guy.
It seems that you and I have some talking to do.
You bastard!
Hello. I just met Amy and she pointed out where you live.
What do you mean?
I can make wishes like this come true.  I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself — tell the truth --
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
Sometimes.
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
At the old house with the voice.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
What's her name?
Irena.
Times have changed.
No kids yet.  Something's gone wrong. Maybe I ought to call somebody.
But they must have.  Amy and I made them out together.  You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
I'm never unfair.
I'm not shouting at you, but there's no doubt in my mind that you spoil this child!
Well, you know where it is.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
I suppose so.
Yes, daddy.
Yes, I did.
I'll show you.
I didn't forget.
Daddy, it's true.
But...
No.
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
This is more fun than just pretend.
But we don't have any sea weed.
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
Yes, Amy.
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
Maybe, if it's a real mourning ring like we have in Jamaica. All you got to do is turn it on your finger, close your eyes, and make a wish.
I'm trying to.
Will you come soon?
I do suppose so. But if you were there yesterday, guess you can get there today.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
Then I'll tell you a story — a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
Yes, yes -
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
Anybody could know that song.
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
That's from her -- that woman.
Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
She needed, a companion, so out of her own hunger she created one. In her mind her friend was in the garden. In her mind her friend never leaves her. Right this very minute I'm sure she's upstairs sobbing out her grief to a friend who exists only in her mind.
What's with her? If they're not bleeding they're PMSing. If they're not PMSing, they're warning you about the impending doom. If you're lucky, you get a sane person one week a month. Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in your life.
James Dean, Humphrey Bogart...
Yeah but they looked cool...
Your lips look delicious.
Never felt better.
I get crazy dreams and I black out.
No it's mom.
Anything's better than Mark.
So don't look in his eyes.
You're just saying that.
No, it grosses me out even thinking of putting something in my eye.
Maybe he likes you, ever think of that? It's good for you to go out -- get your mind off Mark.
To sound like big macho cops. He was probably just found with a knife in his back.
You're at his place, and you come out of the bathroom looking all shy and say, "I'm so embarrassed but could you run out and get me some tampons?" If he says no, he's too embarrassed, then you know he's a wus. If he says he's got some in the bathroom, then you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes to get you tampons, well then he's a decent guy. Then, while he's out...
I can't help it. My bra wouldn't even fit. I've been going to Victoria's Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones and still I'm busting out. It's this PMS.
Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I've become a werewolf!
I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
Tell them you'll meet them outside.
Hide him.
Who is this Madame Sconce? Let's find her and talk to her.
You scared the shit out of me. I thought you were killing yourself.
I guess you'll find out.
Did I kill a guy named Benito?
Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is really over.
Sure. See ya.
Hey, how about a little nightcap?
Yes I do have to pee!
You haven't even paid me back the thousand bucks you owe me!
Take your shower.
Did you change your hair?
No?
That's my ex. He's an asshole. In case you couldn't tell. I think he's been following me.
No. Really. I don't drink coffee anymore. I used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.
So what book did you buy?
Me neither. That's why I wear briefs... So why did you and... Mark break up?
NO! I... I checked when I put my stuff in. I always look through the washer first.
Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
It wasn't a date. Jennifer invited me along to dinner with them.
No, but thanks for the warning.
This is a lot worse than "Betty."
No, my bite's a lot worse.
Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say it.
No. But I don't mind hairy. Are you okay?
Yes or no? Frida, can't you just be honest with me?
You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell you something the other day?
Worse than this?
What about... those guys... I might have...
Okay.
Thanks.
You got a dog?
How big?
Packages of money.
Tell her I'm eating.
It's so bad she becomes a werewolf.
We're just trying to figure out what happened.
Why would you want to be a cop?
Man, you're livin' dangerously. Let me ask you somethin', you always have to get women drunk before they'll sleep with you?
I told you she was innocent.
She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal must have done this.
Back in the '80's. You didn't see the pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell. Her pits, her bush.
And he was missing an arm.
Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed them.
She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
Hard to tell. Looks like he's been cleaned up and he's decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the minute.
Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys? Third, she's the one in danger. She's a woman in jeopardy and you're layin' a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she's no killer.
I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her house, to your house...
What makes her think that?
Can't figure out the species. Similar to a wolf. They're jokin' at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him. Ain't that the stupidest thing you ever heard?
How will we interrogate them?
He tried to kill me!
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think it's time you introduced us to your little friends.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you, Inspector.  Have patience  - you'll see for yourself.
How could you have been so stupid?
Sorry, sir.
Patricia Crenshaw.
Good.
Yes, sir.  <u>Everything</u>?
Shut-up.
I  -  ah - couldn't think of anything else to do.  I thought maybe you know something...  I'm scared.
Why are they after you?
Don't know much, do you?
It sure isn't the fun-fair.
This ocean business...  I know where I can find a map.  I need to go back to the station.  Where will you be?
Yes.
It must be a closet or something.
Everyone has a job  -  a function.  Each one teaches you more about your invention.  I'm what is called a <u>murderer</u>.
But I...
Waves...  A beach.  A woman whispering.  That's all.  I need to stay awake.  Do you have any pills?
You're supposed to be my doctor, right?
You remember nothing, eh?  Let me show you something.
No it isn't.  <u>You</u> are doing it!  Now raise it over the glass and...
Nothing.  I don't know anything!
I'm...  being...  punished.
`Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean,  if you wanted me to talk or...
What?
What the hell is this ?
Great.
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Like how?
Mild stroke?
It's simple, Alan.  We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our `President' to nominate a new one.  The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
We've got nothing, Bob.  This won't work.
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
He's only doing what you told him to.
Just what you think I mean.
It's fine.
I'm not sure.
Choices?
You could buy it on payments.
I'm not sure... I might have.
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
I see what you mean.
A teleprompter.
Right.  Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
But we went there.  We saw those kids.
Does it make the cars any better?
Why?
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars.  Do you want to tell him that?
Certainly.
All I've got is my integrity.  That's all I have.  Now I don't know why you turned your attack dogs on me.
Mr. Kovic.   We're not here about your taxes.
No.
We'd like to hire you.
What about it?
I had a feeling.
The Vice-President...
Well...
Uh...
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
Anybody would have done it.
I don't know.
Home.
Oh... Okay.
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
You have a lot of secrets.
I know.
Yeah... Bedtime.
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
I know.
All set.
NO...NOOOOOOO...SHOOT ME! SHOOT ME! SHOOOOOOOOOT MEEEEEEEEE!!!
Two of us...only two of us...me...and him. 
I dunno. Landing pad for a helicopter? I dunno.
Quiet!
I'm sorry. I was...busy. In the lab.
SHUT UP, MISS HENRIED! I TOL' YA B'FORE!
I'm sorry, General, if I...spoke out of turn. It's just that...Mr Tyler is not here to defend himself. He has no representation. I don't believe due process is being served by...
Gasparilla?
That's why we didn't use prayers on this here white coat 'til after he was destroyed. We ready to fight when we have to. And we gotta fight now.
He's just finding another reason for bumpin' us off. Don't ya see. He needs us ta die. He needs our bodies.
The hospital? 
We got a boat.
We're gonna blow up the powder magazine.
Quicker than gas. And it smells a lot prettier. It usually don't kill but it puts ya under fer a good night's sleep.
I tol' him. I tol' him this is a dead place. Like all the others.
You have ruined weeks of work here! We've been trying to wean these specimens onto alligator meat!
Ah, yes, our noble Gasparilla does seem to favour you lately. I understand he assigned you a roommate of your choice. The rest of us have to pick names out of a hat.
In the battle, sir.
I'm alright. Let's go.
Say Steve, where's your manners?  Here's Mutt's brother and you don't offer him a drink? Want some bourbon?
Knox?
Come on.  It'll help you get Chris.
Well?
Ahh!  Eat it, Dalton!
Garden?
So avoid using the word 'very' because it's lazy.  A man is not very tired, he is exhausted.  Don't use very sad, use morose.  Language was invented for one reason, boys--to woo women--and, in that endeavor, laziness will not do.  It also won't do in your essays.
Like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes, understand?
I told you, that's a secret.
But...
what?!
Yeah, chemistry.  My father thought I should get ahead.
Then don't tell me how to talk to my father when you're the same way.  All right?!
My parents made me take clarinet but I hated it.  The sax is more sonorous.
Damn it, Neil, the name is Nuwanda.
Nice meeting you, Knox.  Bye, Gin.
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Sort of.
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet.  But you can bring someone if you like.
Huh?
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Just like that?!  You just knew?
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
That goes for all of you.  Now eat with your correct hands.
Rahesh Non never existed, Mr. Meeks. You make him or someone like him up.  No self important college professor such as this one would dare admit ignorance of such an obviously important figure and you will probably receive a comment similar to the one I received:
I didn't know you taught.
A sweaty-toothed madman with a stare that pounds my brain.
Eighteen!  That's two years!  What about the play?  The performance is tomorrow night!
Isn't there an easier way?
Yeah.
What I have to do.  Screw the annual.
I'm calling her!
Fellows, would you excuse us a minute?
Good boy.  Call us if you need anything.
But different.
Thanks but  I'd better do history.
Keating said everybody took turns reading.  I don't want to do it.
You want me out...  is that what you're saying?
Sssh.  That's what I'm taking care of. They need a letter of permission.
They gave me the exact same thing as last year!
Maybe they don't think at all unless it's about my brother!  His birthday's always a big to-do.  The stupid thing is, I didn't even like the first one.
what?
YEA, ART THOU THERE?!
All right, be cool, everybody, nice and slow, no sudden moves.
20 hours on the clock. Out and back. Double for overtime.
I know it...but you want to get where you want to get, and back? I need a chief engineer, and unless you got a replacement, I'd highly recommend overlooking the indescretion.
Did you clear this?
That's where my boat's moored.
The thieves.
What are you people talking about?
Jesus Christ lady...
Look lady, I know you people are used to getting your way...
Well, you sure do a good imitation.
Anti social?
How do you know that?
What?
Not unless you can wire a missle or fix an engine.
No...
He's not coming...
You ain't giving the orders here!
I saw these guy perform...at Altmont ...you know that? They opened for the Stones...
Just the man I wanted to see. On this puppy here, you remember if it's red to blue or blue to red...
Squid...squid like...squid type... it's got tentacles, a feed sac... probably one central nervous processor somewhere...what the hell do I know is going on deep down in the ocean...there's all sorts of shit we've never seen...eighty foot clams...60 foot sharks...I'm just guessing...can you get me more juice out of Hercules...fast?
A passenger...
You mean countries that are acknowledged by the UN...or like made up countires too?
Nothing.
John...
Yeah.
Good... Pass the beer.
What do you think, Sal? Jesus, you think we'd miss this?
Yeah, Sal--
You're full of shit!
Fuckin' A. It's gotta!
It's Nick!
I know, but...
Vince thinks... you know...
In case!!! The gun's in case!!!
She might!!! She might do it, Albert, but you can't fuckin' tell me that she does!!!
Hey, Nick! God damn!... What've you been doin', I mean...
Yeah.
Hey, Angela, Sal and I go back a long way.
But you must come in.
But I insist.
You are frightened, no?
I came to see Merle.
Yeah.
Linda, yeah.
Elephants! Make way... I gotta get elephants!
Who's got the ammo?
Inside, Vince.
She's out of her tree, Nick. She is straight out of her tree.
Biederman!
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
Naw, it's... I mean...
Right here.
I don't know.
No. No, no.
I want to go home, Merle.
There's Vince!
Hell no!
Merle --
What else?
What do you mean?
More bullets in the gun?
Fine. She's fine... Merle, what the hell are you doing?
Merle... Hey, Merle, listen...  Why?
As soon as you're hitched, Sal. First we get you hitched.
Right.
John Wayne... Listen, Nick --
I gotta get back, Nick.
Nick. I'm so scared. I'm so fuckin' scared to go home.
Trip? What do you mean, Nick? You said you'd be --
Same old thing. Hey, same like always. Nothing's changed. Albert is getting fat.
Aw, it's a long story!
Down.
Up.
I can smell it.
He just wants me to make him cinnamon cookies like I made for you.
It was Wade's old partner... Gallagher. He was behind it all.
When you bring in Doucet.
Out of the room.
You can't win like this.  You'll only get older.  This is what you wanted!
We have to talk.
You want evidence.  I'll give you evidence.
It's a real mess down here.  Some- thing must a'gone wrong.  No man could possess that kind of strength after being frozen for twenty years.
NPA syndrome will hit 'im fast.  Have your men gear up the Edicon system at a twenty-year ratio in fractions of fives.  Saying a prayer won't be bad either.
Fine.
How do I look?
Keep 'em busy.
Ah Mom, you're embarrass'n me.
Officer Hector Sanchez, Sergeant. Hillside Academy.  Status G-8. Security Clearance 3.  One year Advance Technical Crime Analyst. Weapons Assistant.  FDA Junior Captain, Hollywood division---
But Sergeant...
Trust me.  You don't want to know.
'Bout the same time I busted Doucet I tried to nail this big-time dealer. I didn't have an ID, but I was close. Too close.  Gained the confidence of a badass named Dubbs.  He was going to turn me onto the big man.  He made me for a cop.  Mysteriously my fellow officers discovered ten pounds of heroin in my cruiser.
Nothing makes sense when you're a cop.
Hey, Rip Van Winkle, maybe we'd better call it a night.
Never use it.  Stuff'll kill ya.
Yes, sir.
With all this technology you don't even have to show up for work.  Who needs cops when you've got gizmos.
We're partners, aren't we?
That's just it.  He never did time. Seems each arrest was botched for one reason or another.  Judge threw out the cases each time.  Either he's got a horseshoe up his ass or powerful friends.
Aaah... Mother of Jesus.
He's got my grandson, Sanchez.
And you should be with your family.
This is the guy that killed my partner.
They always are.
Yeah.
My mom says I'm gonna grow.
Good to know you, Willy.
I don't care if you've got the Good Housekeeping seal of approval... I'm not looking for company.
We will --
They're just outsiders. They want to see how fine Jabez Stone lives these days. They're waiting for your guests, too --
They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain.  Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
I've brought you something to keep you warm, Mrs. Stone --
I didn't.
Guess there will, if it says so.
A varied list of attractions. And which would you like to see first, Dan'l?
And what about Daniel Webster?
Well -- it's high and it's wide and it goes a long way and there is a wind blowing through it and a blue roof over it -- it's the hills up here and the rivers running south and the new States growing in the West.
No, siree, it didn't. And it won't -- no matter what happens -- just as long as the folks at the fair believe in freedom and Union. So --  Giddyap, Constitution -- and let's keep going, Mr. Stone.
I did not, Grandma.
Why, of course, Hank -- I've always got time for a neighbor. What's on your mind?
Now don't you worry about that. You just leave it all to me. We won't talk business now ... just bear this in mind ... I'm not the man to get rich on other people's hard luck.... No, sir... not me! ...
Sure am.
Why not! There's a bill up in Congress to give us a uniform law of bankruptcy. Daniel Webster is fighting for it right now--
Well, Stone -- have you got the money?
What a fine boy you have, Jabez. How old is he now?
Well -- it seems to me -- I remember when you paid me--
Don't say that -- I know it is --
What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
I do -- and I think you should too.
You can't say that to me! I'm New Hampshire. If I say I called you, I did.  I guess I did.
Yes, of course, people forgot -- or the men who knew about it died, you know how these things happen.
Well, why should that worry you. A soul -- a soul is nothing. Can you see it, smell it, touch it? -- No! -- Think of it -- this soul -- your soul -- a nothing, against seven whole years of good luck! You will have money and all that money can buy. Upon my word, Neighbor Stone, if it weren't for my firm's reputation for generous dealing--
A pin, Neighbor Stone! I'm afraid, you'll have to prick your finger -- but what's a little pain to a lucky man?
You promised me prosperity, happiness, love, money, friendship --
He ain't dead -- he's dancing in there.
I'm through with you.
Not now! Not now!  -- Let me make up -- let me make up.
Anything -- anything. -- You can have it all back -- that money -- the new house -- my farm -- the whole caboodle!
About what?
But, Mr. Stone, I am hardly to blame for the pricking of your wholly unnecessary conscience.  Is this your signature?
Thank you, Mr. Webster.
Morning, Jabez.
Come right into the parlor, won't you, folks.
You mean that's all you had me come out here for?
Well -- yes --
You are not so sure that he'll come.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Jabez!
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
I am going to lock him up.
It shows on your face.
Oh, Jabez! ...  Did you hear, Mr. Webster? --  Now you'll help him, won't you?
I just figgered -- knew you didn't have enough bills.
That's a word you're too free with lately, Jabez, consarn this and consarn that ...
All right, son -- if it helps.
Say, Mary, how is your shoulder?
Well, thank the Lord you can always depend on New England for weather. We've got enough for the whole United States.
Ma -- and yet, a man could change that, couldn't he?
I say -- it don't matter.
You'll be a father any minute now.
Hello, Jabez -- I was just talking to Stevens about a little extension on your payment.
Mary -- Jabez --
Yes, Mrs. Slossum told me -- Lucy can't even keep a secret -- Selectman -- my son -- well, who would have thought of that?
Martin Van Buren Aldrich and my Pa's the only Democrat in Cross Corners. He said you had horns and a tall, Mr. Webster, but I ain't seen 'em yet.
Of course not --
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Not so fast, Mr. Scratch. Produce your evidence -- if you have it.
Then I stand on the Constitution! I demand a trial for my client.
I do! If I can't win this case with a jury, you shall have me, too. If two New Hampshire men aren't a match for the devil, we'd better give this country back to the Indians.
Why, you long-barreled, slab-sided, lantern- jawed, note-shaving crook, be off with you ...
The past six months.
So, why didn't you come?
You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack?
Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.  I'm in charge here.
We must shut down the building.  Go wider --!
Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl!
Who are you, then?
I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...?
Gennero.  Miss Gennero.
Holly, we have to stop meeting like this.  So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery.  So why nuke the building, Hans?
Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch?
I'm ahead of you...partner.
Al, what's wrong?  Did something --  -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here --
I'm here, cowboy.
Don't tell me, partner.  I'm just a desk jockey who was on the way home when you rang.
You don't want to know.
How do you know?
-- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know!
Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead!
You men shoot, aim for the white meat!
Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?!
Don't call yourself fat.
Heidi - why didn't you come down here?
It's too late - just get away from me - don't talk to me now - go over to your place...
Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge.
The robbers in the bank.  They got guns?
I love you.
Yeah, well I don't blame him.
That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost.
I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you.
I like that... yeah!
What?
All right.  Then what do you want me to say?
That's great.  Just terrific.  You talk to me with them on the phone, right?  That is really smart.  And, you don't tell me?
All right, enough!  Who the fuck is on the phone... anyway?  Is that you Moretti?  You on the phone?  Will somebody talk to me?
All right!  He didn't do it.  All right?  Now... would you get the fuck off the phone?  I'll bet that really changed them, huh?  Anyway, Leon... did I do it for you?
Do you still want the operation?
Oh no!
What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him.
He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person.
What are you doin' in there?
This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you...
They're okay.
I'm not alone.
What do you want to know that for?
Right -- I'm with you, buddy.
It's okay, you got a lot of protection.
I don't know, Sonny.  I don't know if the helicopters can land in here. I'll have to check it out.  I got superiors, unnerstan?  They don't always see eye to eye with me. I'll do what I can.
Sonny, come on out!
Wait a minute ... everything you asked for is on the way ...
We're bringing in your wife...
He's all doped up.
Well, you get your mind right.  I'm a Catholic and I don't wanna hurt nobody, but goddamn it, don't you play no games with me.  Unnastand?!?
It's all we got.
Believe me, I'm on your side.
It's locked on the inside.  It's through that passageway and to the right.
They make $105 a week to start. They fold the flag, check the place out in the morning.  I don't know what they learn, Sonny.
If you take anybody, please take me.
I don't know.
They look like good kids.
I told you, he's got diabetes.
You were terrific, too!
No, not until after they killed him.
Yeah.
You stopped?  Why?
Fuck him - let him out!
I'll tell you right now - that I'm ready to do it.
Dead or alive?
All right ... send them the guard.

... because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal ... I'm never going back to prison ... We got our own deal already ... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar ... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do ... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say!
They gotta stop sayin' that.
I'd like to work with you on this, not against you.
Okay, when do I get them?
I want them all.
Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the...
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this.  I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
Oh my God!  I don't understand.  If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me?  Everything I got is yours.  I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings.  It's yours.  You know it.
What'll you do?  Come out.
Doing what?
I don't know ... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right?
Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week?  You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment ... what are you givin' us?
<i>My theft insurance policy will have to fork over the ten million... but that will take six to eight months due to Nevada state law.</i>  <i>But you should know sir... that I employ bounty hunters. My bounty hunters can find these thieves.</i>

<i>I forgot.</i>
Did it hurt?
Mr. Weiss was very generous in turning over some video tapes to the FBI. There's lots of footage of you. We know everything.  If you don't come clean... the information on these tapes could send you to prison for a very long time.
<i>Her car was in the shop.</i>
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
Fuck 'em. Their loss is our gain. Put the money in the safe until we hear from Claremont. <b>
I said stop it.
I found him pan-handling on Third Street Promenade. Took him under my wing. We been hunting together ever since.

Just shut up and do what they say. They're gonna kill us if we don't, Ian.
But real. This is gritty. Like Cassavetes.
She went up to her room.
Real good.
I be.  I'm living large.
We shouldn't buy a single slice, spend a single penny in that motherfucker till some people of color are put up in there.
If I wasn't a righteous Black man you'd be in serious trouble. SERIOUS.
Have you noticed something about them?
And?
What?
No.  I'm just a struggling Black man trying to keep my dick hard in a cruel and harsh world.
I wasn't trying to be a hero.  I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think.  If I did, I might not have done it in second thought.  Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years. 
Is it a good morning?
I didn't.
That's it?
You got a deal.
It's gonna be hot today.
Later.  Gotta get paid.
I just come home to take a quick shower.
I'm coming.
Stop tripping.
Don't worry about it.
Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the street.  I betcha they haven't been a year off da motherfucking boat before they opened up their own place.
Him no white.  Him no white.
Depends.
Here, you gotta delivery.
Sal, I want my money.
You only pay me two-fifty a week.  I owe you fifty bucks.
OK.  OK.
That's it?
What took you so long?  Is it hot?
Where's the ice cream?  The Häagen- Dazs butter pecan?
I can run out and get it.
Tina, you don't have a forehead, you got a eight-head.
Yes, yes, Lord.  Isn't this better than Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?
Tina, I'll be right back.
Later.
Fuck dat shit.  I deliver pizzas. That's what I get paid for.
Who don't work?  Let's see you carry six large pies up six flights of stairs.  No elevator either and shit.
People are free to do what they wanna do.

Ya like him, huh?
I was going to buy a slice.
I just copped them.  Let me tell you the story of Right-Hand--Left- Hand--the tale of Good and Evil.
He's nuts.
Forget it, Mookie.
Good.  Vito, you trust that Mook too much.  So does Pop.
I know so.  He, them, they're not to be trusted.
I like Mookie a lot.
Mister Radio Raheem, I can't even hear myself think.  You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.
Too many pizzerias already there.
Don't start on me today.
Actually we have something for you.
Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
Oh, you want to talk about your delicates?
I'm fine.
Are you kidding? I couldn't be more okay.
I, uh... changed for dinner. I get dressed for all my meals. Except breakfast and bath-meal.  Boy, it's hot in here. Mind if I open a window?
Then what are we doing sitting around yapping? Let's eat!
No, I'm fine thanks.
I know I am, Mom.
Is it okay if he spends the night?
Here I am bragging my Mom is the tooth fairy, and I'm talking to Santa's kid!
Don't we want them to talk to us?
How nerdy is that? I'm wearing two pairs right now.
Oh, is this your special place?
The second R is silent.
HARRY, what are you doing? She's a foreign exchange student. She doesn't speak the English.  CHING CHONG ching chingy chingy chong chong.
Now that's more of what we're looking for.
Who's Captain Rob?
Sounds like a pirate.
Yeah, he's a pirate.
A-ha! You landed on Candyland! Now swallow it!
Shut up!
Now you see why he was elected principal?
That's why you have to drink it fast, trust me.
What a nerd. I don't know where that girl's ever gonna find a husband.
Okay, I saw this in a movie once. Open the dining room window and follow my lead. Say what I say.
What are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Yeah, right. Why don't you show it to your "girlfriend"?
Do you hear something, Captain Rob?
Me, me, me!
No. What happened?
No. Look.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
Yes. Screw George Washington. Just like Marilyn Monroe did.
Hey, where'd you go?
That's gross.
Not to expect you tonight.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Special Needs class.
Do you want me to pet your head?
Come on, I live with the janitor. I have a key to every room in the school.
Principal's office? Yeah, I guess I can swing that.
This is so embarrassing, it's never happened before. Well, maybe a couple of times, but I was alone.
Boyfriend? What about all that talk about riding my waxer?
Principal of jail. Wow. What a promotion.
Duh. I'm in your class at school.
I don't know if you'd call us "friends"...
Of course it does.  Obviously in denial.  Maybe we can help.
You can bring whatever you want, little friend.
Go in there and get us two slushees.
Hey can be on top?
You know I do!
It's too close to call.  Okay next contest, now lets...
We're not crazy. We're "special". PRINCIPAL COLLINS wants us to have our own classroom!
People! Come on. "Parade" float.
You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
No, it actually fit quite nicely.  Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
Yeah, I get it. Don't worry I studied acting at the police academy just let me do the talking and you'll be fine.
How baby-cakes? You've done it all.
Aloha means hello and goodbye.
I think you'll make a good teacher.
Who's there?
Oh, things. Photos. Tapes. I tape everything that goes on in this office.
Everything. Just for the record.
The chest! The chest that I put my papers in.
Forced spice evolution of humans changes many things.... I must sit close to him.
We are alone...
Yes?... How was your journey?
It's a high-efficiency filter and heat exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck. Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the nose tubes.
Is this what you seek?
They said you were dead.  They said...

Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move.  He races up a rocky incline.

I told you, I don't want any of your goddamn coffins.
Huh?
I don't want anything.  I'm just a really big, big fan.  I've seen all your movies.
Do you want me to get it for you?
Don't worry.  I do it every Halloween.
Ah, so I pull the strings!
Of course!  Dracula requires <u>presence</u>.  It's all in the voice, and the eyes, and the hand --
That's good.  I could use the money.
"Oh, tract housing, huh?"  Laugh. "You need a new real estate agent."
That's fine, Bela.  We're still rolling.  Just say "Dear, you're lovely."
This is the Philosophical Research Society.  A refuge for free thinkers. I've been coming here for twenty years.
Bad decisions are easy to live with. Forget.  Just keep looking forward.
You'll be fighting with the octopus.
Once you're in it, it warms up.
Bela, somebody misplaced the motor. So when you wrestle the octopus, shake the legs a bit, to make it look like it's killing you.
It'll be wonderful.  We'll be at peace.  In the afterlife, you don't have to worry about finding work.
Formaldehyde.
Fine.  Let them!  There is no such thing as bad press.  A man from New York even said he's putting me on the front page!  First celebrity to ever check into rehab.  When I get out of here, I will be healthy.  Strong!  I will be primed for my comeback!
Really?  I don't feel so great.
No, this is just the second unit. We'll do the main footage later.
Eddie, how was I?
Did you see that kid grab Vampira's tits?
What do you mean?
No, it's fine.  It's real!  In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
This is the big moment...!
And who may you be?
It's that easy?
I told you, the octopus is made of rubber.  This is a piece o' cake.
Isn't he?
Aw, er, it's just a bunch of hot air. I had to say something to get in the door.
Better than not getting a job?
Boris Karloff!?
This is my way of telling you --
Some weirdo who likes to wear dresses.
That's the problem!  <u>Nobody</u> cares about my movie!  I'm tryin' so hard, I don't know what else to do!
Dolores, don't you understand?  I'm a director now!  I made "Glen Or Glenda."  Directing <u>is</u> my day job.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?!  Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
Like <u>what</u>?!
That's moronic.  Why would a bit player impress a backer?
Does she have room for me?
Oh.  Er... well you're the file clerk.  You're hurrying into the next room, when you bump into Janet.
What other sixty-thousand?
That's not true --
I just made this picture, over at Screen Classics.  It opens next week.
Look, Lugosi is dead and Vampira won't talk.   Ihad to give <u>somebody</u> the dialogue.
Da pleasure be mine.
Really?  Was the third act too intense?
Okey-dokey.
Uh, I don't have much of an appetite lately.
Nonsense!  You must try our hot glug.
It's the damn money men.  You never know who's a windbag, and who's got the goods.  And then they all think <u>they're</u> a director...
Tits.
Yeah, but if you took that crap and put a star in it, you'd have something!
Who?
There's still a sex-change --
I don't think he's a schmuck.
I know a guy in Universal's stock house -- he's giving me the footage for free.  This movie's gonna look like a million bucks.
Maybe it needs special handling.
Booties for my father.  He gets cold in this hospital.
I am.  How's your father?
Not good...
Bela died.
Well you tried --
So?  It's only a five-hour drive. And it'll probably clear up, once we hit the desert.  Heck, it'll probably clear up once we drive around the corner.  I promise.
Yes?
You don't wanna be noticed?
What's uncanny?
Yeah...?
What octopus motor?
So how long have you known Eddie?
Don't you think angora has a tactile sensuality lacking in all other clothing?
It's made from specially-bred rabbits that live in the Himalayas.
You shouldn't be embarrassed by the truth.  Mind if I order some hotcakes...?
Honey, I have a little secret to share with you.
Look, you seem like a nice guy, Ed, but you're just not my type.  But keep in touch.  Let me know when your movie opens.
Come on...
I'm going to be living with my brother. He's not in such good shape as I am, but... I'm looking forward to the pillow fights.
You're nuts.
Excuse me.
And all the kids stared calling me "Pumpkin Ass." "Hey Pumpkin Ass," -- for like a year. So, now, I feel like everyone's watching me and, you know, I'm "Pumpkin Ass" again.
Can I give you one bit of advice? About Shari?
You said a woman likes to be pursued.
No. You screwed up my life just so you could get higher ratings. You never gave a shit about me.
This guy.
I'm not sure about the entire concept.
I've got this great idea. We put together a video. "The Network Executives Goofiest Moments." And listen, i've really loved working here.
Hotel? What were they doing in a hotel?
Look at this -- people are getting married, they're getting married...
Tell me.
I'm gonna stick this right in your eye.
Do you want us to come in the kitchen?
Eddie, how could you do it? Your brother's girlfriend.
I don't know. She's living with that "entertainer"...
Mm.
So everything he told me yesterday was a lie. Everything.
Yes to me or yes to the coil?
Holy sh--
He had a woman in my own bed! And how dare you call him "Dad" in front of Al.  This is your father. This is who was there for you when you needed someone.
Oh God. What hospital?
Well, he's the only one in America who doesn't!
No.
All right, I'11 pay for the parking. Big network!
Oh, Christ. Did you go to bat for me?
I hear the dog really liked him.
I saw this show once. It was about logging. I was home sick, there was nothing else on. Do you know how they break up really bad log jams? You know, when they're really tangled... ?
It's... okay
All right. Okay. I'11 ... see you.
Weird? If this happened last month it would've been weird. Now with... the TV and... now it's just too weird.
Ed... I think we should stop seeing each other.
No. Who?
Who cares? I don't ca -- No. I do care.  Shame on everybody. Shame on you! Well, just the seventy-one percent. The other... 
Exactly. Boy, you're smart.  Why are you so mean to her? What did she do to you?  "Is she good enough for Ed?" Who the hell am I?  Who the hell do you think I should be dating?
Just... just relax. Okay? We won't do anything. We'11 just sit here for a while.
No... Could you?
Where were you?
What are you drunk?
You're in show business?
In a second! In a hot second. Let me ask you something --
All right. Let me ask you something... are you happy like this?
I don't know.
Yeah?!
Hey. Check this out.  Look at this.
No, this is great.  You'll love this.  He's a singer.
It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ...
Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes.
Cassie...
Me?!
A hundred per cent cotton. Okay, here we go, Andy.
Who's Shari?
Hi.
No. Am I supposed to?
So you saw me on TV and you said "Hey, let me jump on this."
Ed... I'm sorry.
Well, it was really nice meeting you and, uh...  I'd better get a cab.
Sure.
That's the point -- this could change things.
Oh, an TV a minute and already an attitude.
pierdes.
Yeah, it's serious.  I mean she inspires me in ways Sherry never has. She even wants to read my novel.
That's the whole point. It's all in my head; it's right here.  I just got to get it out there. Tracy wants me to write it so she can read it.  It's beautiful.
Well, I notice you don't seem to have any close friends at Millard. You seem to be kind of a loner.
Thank you.
Yeah, uh, just a minute
Fine. You know. We just went to Crossroads.
Dick... Dick,..
Tammy,  now we've come to a decision. He just think it would be best --
So nice
But, they were there I counted 803 votes.
You can put those in my box.  I'll look at them tomorrow.
Right
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
So like I was saying, things were going pretty well in my life.
Look, why don't we just forget about Tammy?  We'll have the assembly tomorrow, everybody'll make their speeches, and I'm sure everything will be fine.
Were you or were you not working in the Watchdog office over the weekend?
I'm looking at new cars.
Yeah.
Yes?
Doing what?
Nooo.  I just thought...  l mean, I am looking for a new car.  But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends.  And then things would be different.  Don't you think?
I did it.
I have proof.
Okay.  Give me the drill.
Oh, come on.  You've had a hard year, you're cooped up with the kid all the time.  Let go; live a little.
Should we get a what?
Oh.
Three twenty-five.
Sherry... I love you.
No way I It doesn't make sense.
I told you ... I can't. I just -- It doesn't feel right anymore, you know?
I know.
Sorry.
What do you mean?
No.  Uh... I just... you know, I just thought --
Yeah, you too, Tracy.  I'm just glad it's over.
You know, I don't understand why everybody bad-mouthed Tracy all the time.  She was always super- nice to me.
Oh, yeah, sure.  Hey Nolan, give my book to Tracy when you're done*
Paul, get out!
What's it to you?
Yeah, plain scotch.
No I haven't.  Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
That's right.  Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
Maybe I'm just fucking curious.
Yeah.
I'm not sure.
Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today.
It's Bud.
You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley?
This business, Captain?
Call me Dudley.
Of course... But how?
Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer?
What was that boyfriend's name?
It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White?
Get the fuck away from me.
They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them.
There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down.
Which one are you and which one am I?
At least not anymore.
We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn.
I'm not asking you.
You know I do or you wouldn't be here.  How did you find me?
He no longer works for me.  Find Susan's killer, Mr. White. I'll give you a handsome reward. <u>Whatever you desire</u>.
I got her address.
And you fuck people up for a living.  That don't make me you. <u>Capisce</u>, shitbird?
His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill.
Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing.
He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny?
<u>Ear plugs</u>.
It doesn't exactly play like dumb panic.
The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department.
Say what and so what.
I don't own no shotguns.
I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge.
Gone.  Not a trace.
I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down.
I'll break them, sir.
Don't start trying to do the right thing, John.  You haven't had enough practice.
<u>Throwing me</u>?
What about you?
I want you to follow Bud White.
What?
Yeah.  But first I want to brace Stompanato.
What?
A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself.
With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir.
Of his penis, sir?
I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about.
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
I see Bud because I want to.  I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money.  I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is.  There's more if you want to hear it.
I don't hate White.  I really don't.  It's just, in my business, it's the wild cars you have to watch out for.
Some reality.
You're the first person to ever call me tough.
Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down?
Officer White?
I don't doubt it -- Oh, God.
You lost me, Sid.  Who?
I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station.
You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute.
Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera.
Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all.
You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up.
Vincennes, is there someplace you'd rather be?
Oh?  Anyplace else?
Oh Jesus.
I don't know what that means.
Listen--
Turn on CNN.
Goddammit, shut the fuck up and turn on CNN!
Do it!
Be careful, Danny.
Except for the part about my setting up a company in Zurich and knowing anyone named Sam Vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the Gambino family.
Rachel Banks?
I don't know who he is.
Told by whom?
Well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, David, maybe I'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.
230 Giga-Hertz. They use that band for the Aquacade Spy-SAT uplinks.
If I knew, they'd be after <u>me</u>. Which they probably are right now. 'Bye.
They're spooks.
One-twenty.
I didn't use my name.
How'd you have the manpower to--
Jesus.
They come after you?
Why?
Oh my God...
That wasn't so hard.
Let's not do the tire thing anymore, okay?
Tell me about it.
No he won't.
So what do we do now?
What if we do a mailing to Congressmen.
The area's wired for surveillance, they'll be <u>looking</u> for those moves.
Listen--
Are you sure about this?
Neil, thank you for your help.
Dylan, I was just asking Eric if--
I'm married to my wife...of several years...and I'd like to buy...as a Christmas present...
Is that good?
Okay.
The robbery.
I was <u>in</u> the store, the accident was outside. It was a bus.
What kind of trouble.
I'm happy to help you all I can. But I didn't see the accident and I barely knew Daniel Zavitz. I've gotta go to work.
No, sir.
Listen to him.
Honey, I don't like to talk about this stuff in front of Eric.
Well, you know--
There's just, clearly, some administrative snafu. I'm sure this is the worst of it.
I didn't want you to be upset. I shouldn't have lied. Stacy, there's nothing between me and Rachel Banks.
Stacy--
Was that doctored-up, too?
I went to the bank to see why. They said you emptied our accounts--
This is my house. Nobody's kicking me out of my house. I picked those drapes.
What happened to your head?
That's okay.
You opened the thing?
Albert's gonna get me my job back.
Sir?
Well, I was hoping you might stop by my office to swear out a criminal deposition against some of your friends and co-workers.
That's probably not you in the picture. I tell you what, I'll just run the thing by the Grand Jury, see if they can't--
I'd like to speak to someone about what's happening to me.
I'll see if I can, you know, work things out.
Not that much.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
He doesn't work that way.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
What're you gonna do, Rachel? You gonna sit in a bar in Baltimore? You want your job back? You want a life?
We'd like to recover any materials Mr. Zavitz may have given you--
Shut the fuck up.
Seat 74.
L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
Are those my Christmas presents?
Alright!
Sounds like they didn't want anything that wasn't electric?
Table 122?
An investigation? It was a bus accident.
Bobby--
Why would the NSA--
Listen to me.
No, listen to me. You gotta let me bring you in.
No. No, it's okay.
How can I reach you?
I don't know.
Jesus! I just told you. I don't know.
Someone's trying to destroy my life, and I'd like to find out who.
You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.
I said fuck you.
There was a transfer.
Several indiscriminates and one primary who we've ID'd as Robert Dean. A Crystal City attorney.  Mr. Reynolds?  Sir?
Get it.
Sir--
We believe?
You're kidding me.
And if it wasn't?
Puffed cheese?
No.
What kind of fossils?
I don't want to go back.
I don't care to bargain.
As the wife of one of our party.
He said - be careful.
Pardon?
Now.
Now.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
This is empty, just coming!
I'm not agreeing.  Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
Don't go over it again, please.
Would you let me pass?
I can't move.  I can't get out.
I know.  I'm sorry.  I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
Listen to me, Katharine.  You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it.  I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe.  I'm going to have to walk to El Taj.  Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel.  And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
I know.
I haven't, no.  Sorry.
Could I trouble you for some water?
Cut the ropes.  I left a note, on his blanket.  At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot.  The Girl wouldn't leave, of course.  Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
Good, we're all here?  A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
Right.
I told you so.
Yes.  It was.  Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
Shut-up!
That's your name innit?  Count Fucking Arsehole Von Bismarck? What's that supposed to be then, Irish?
I don't know.
Don't cut me.  Come on.
I met your friend Mary.  She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier.  Bonjour.
You should be happy.  What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
Please don't creep around this house.
For?
Is there a song you don't know?
Me?
I see.
Oh really?
Aren't you?
I can already see.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Yes?
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
K is for Katharine.
Hey! -
Never heard of it.
Yes, for your hair.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
Hello miss.
He's sleeping.
Does he have to go?
Go away.
This is making me incredibly angry.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
Go on, do it.  I don't need to hear any more.
Why?  Are you German?
Through a window.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
Who am I?
It's sold.
How about if you try disappearing.
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
Uh, yes.
I'll call an ambulance.
I sincerely hope so.
So what?
You...you can't.
No. Why would I be?
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
Good morning.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
In a week.
We go underwater?
Try laps. Say a hundred.
A dozen times.
It's---beautiful.
Terrified. Still am.
Bookshelf. Sensors--
In eye of that painting.
It's a party.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
It's your mistake.
Get the hell in.
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
Okay, 80-20--
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Hold the record. Alone.
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
My job, my rules.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Transfer.
We're doing it tonight.
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
I'm not leaving without you.
But--
Next time I'll use valet parking.
Which is--
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
This is big enough.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
You're giving them to me?
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Thanks.  I'll keep it in mind.
Hey, excellent.  Thanks.
Nothing you can't show up for with a stain.
It's an inflammation of the spinal cord and part of the brain.
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
I'll say.  Holy moley.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
They did?
The what?
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
For what?
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
A number for the whole group, or for us?
Any school you want.
Yup.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
Where's Anna?
Excuse me?
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
Course I did.
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
That's crazy -- why not?
Oh, you do?  With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
Yeah, yeah.  Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
They skipped that step.
PG&E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that.  Still a lot of money.
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
How do you know that?
Corey.
Right.
And ...?
That's right.
What do you mean?
I guess I did.
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
Nope.  Maiden.
Not anymore.
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
Good luck.  Oh -- I wouldn't advertise what you're looking for if I were you ...
I don't know.
Some meeting.  With PG&E people.
You never fall short for the work people.  I guess maybe you just love them more.
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
You don't know six hundreds plaintiffs' numbers by heart.
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
You got more than one?
Why not?
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Cause I like kids.  I like hanging out with them.
Yup.  Usually working on my bike.  No big deal.  If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
What do you mean?
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
How would you know?
Keep your voice down.
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
I need it.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
Outside with the sprinkler.  So it's good?
My daughter, she's bought a big house with a room for me.  I'm going to move in with her.
Yes?
Is this a joke?  Did Baxter put you up to this?
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
Right, I guess those are the kids --
You did?
Asteroids don't concern me, Admiral. I want that ship, not excuses.  How long until you can have Skywalker and the others in the Millennium Falcon before me?
Yes, Admiral .... soon.
Alert all commands.  Calculate every possible destination along their last known trajectory and disburse the fleet to search for them.  Don't fail me again, Admiral, I've had quite enough!
But Han and Leia will surely die.
Barks an argument and shakes his head.
I'm sure I'll see you again, too. Keep well.  You'd better chain him until it's over.
Barks his Òright on!Ó
Away put your weapon.  I mean you no harm.
Looking?  Looking?  You've found someone I'd say.  Heh?  Yes!
A great warrior?  Not many on those.  Wars don't make one great.
Okay, Artoo, let him have it. Now get out of here, little fellow, we've got things to do.
Probably isn't good enough, Sergeant. Check on it!
There is a grave disturbance in The Force.
You are weak!  I have seen it. The Force is strong with him. He must be destroyed.
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does shutting down all but emergency power systems include me?
I'm going to see what it is.
No kidding.  If this snowball's got nasty natives, they could be anywhere.
This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
Two more Star Destroyers heading right at us.
How do I look?
Well, I hope you don't expect more.
They're just trying to see if they can stir something up ... we're safe.
Afraid of?  Certainly not you Captain Solo ... or any other man in this galaxy.
Where?
There will be more of them.  They always travel in groups.  And there's nothing they like better than to attach themselves to ships. Just what we need right now.
Chewie, check the manual release on the landing claws.
The fleet is finally breaking up. I'm hoping they'll follow standard Imperial procedure and dump their garbage before they go into light speed.
Can you trust him?
Something's wrong here.  Your friend Lando is very charming, but I don't trust him.
Chewie, do you think you can repair him?
I'm worried about all of us.  I can't figure out what they're up to.
Hyperdrive.
Not as well as I'd like.  We're a small outpost and not very self- sufficient.  I've had supply problems of every kind and ...  What's so funny?
You will find them well enough. But they must never again leave this city.
I didn't know you had a price on your head.  Vader has given you to the bounty hunter.
... we're the bait.
I'm coming over to your side, that's what.  And I have a feeling I'm making a big mistake.
I didn't say anything?
It's Luke.  Get under him.  Slow down.  Easy Chewie.  Line up your tracking system.  Lando, open the hatch.
Are the coordinates set?
Closer?!
I'm fine.  Really.  Leia ... when I was out there and it looked pretty bad ... well, it made me think about things.
Size has no meaning.  It matters not.  Look at me.  Judge me by my size do you?
I thought those seekers were set for stun!
Bespin.  I see it too ... Friends you have there, heh?  Concentrate and see them you will.
It is the future you see.
Foreknowledge is helpful, but painful sometimes and dangerous too.  You have far to go in your training.
I'll die first.
Anything on the Millennium Falcon?
Yes, sir.  We're in luck.  The sick bay's almost empty except for a mauled fox cub, a deer with pneumonia, and a depressed gorilla. The Apes will be hidden from the public.  They'll be quarantined. If they want medical attention, it's available on the spot.  And the experts can start giving them the once-over first thing in the morning. General Brody's very pleased.
It's a strain of the Plutoxin 7 virus. Genetically engineered. 100% pure death. Complete nervous system shutdown. You crash and bleed out like a stuck pig. Not a pretty sight.
You never heard of Snake Plissken?
Go on now. Do as I say.
Nobody leaves Cuervo Jones. Not unless you give your life. You fight till you're dead. Then I forgive you.  Understand?  Understand?
We'll see.
You said I could be Vice-President, Cuervo. Your right-hand man.
Can you land?
My name is no longer Carjack. Will you please get that through your fucking head?
What's the little black box do?
Having second thoughts?
There's a war about to be declared, or didn't you know?
A medical team will be standing by.
No.
Nuclear turbine to 75% power.
It's history. I gotta go.
You're gonna have to learn to respect the law, Snake. The United States is a no- smoking nation. No smoking, no drinking, do drugs, no women unless you're married, no guns, no foul language. It's a brand new day for you, Snake.
I give you my word. Put the prototype into my hands, and you're a free man.
Delgado?
Oh, man... You didn't have to hit me, Snake. I can help you.
I could've helped you. We coulda made a deal with Cuervo. If you'd listen...
I couldn't help it, Snake. I had to shoot you. Cuervo made me do it, I swear to God, man.
Which way?
Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
Which way to the Hollywood Bowl?
Where's... Cuervo Jones...?
Where?
Who?
The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
The what?
Find Cuervo Jones.
Thank God.
I will not.
Then make me your champion and I will always fight in your place.
We spared the lives of a few, so they could sail home and tell their fellows what fate they met at the hands of King Arthur's knights...
It is deep...
That's not why you came.
The Lady of the Lake. Take it. Take it, quickly!
Just yes? No mad laughter, no riddles, nothing but a simple yes? That frightens me.
I didn't ask for poetry. Which is it?
My powers fade, Arthur. I resort to cheap tricks...  Yes! I enjoy every moment of my foolishness, I join in the making of it, so no one can betray me. But you! You betray yourself.
You betray the boy who drew the sword, the boy who saw the Dragon... the Dragon who moves close by, coiling and uncoiling, restless, looking down, waiting for the King to be a king...
It is like a tree. The roots of the stones spread out across the land and they draw on the thoughts and actions of men. Like sap those human matters course through the stones feeding the stars that are the leaves of the tree. And the stars whisper back to men the future course of events.  But the earth is being torn apart, its metals stolen, and the balance is broken and the lines of power no longer converge. In fact, I nearly didn't make it in one piece.
Not you, my husband?
If I am your judge, I cannot be your champion. When I act as your King, I cannot be your husband.
Forgive me, my wife, if you can. I was not born to live a man's life, but to be the stuff of future memory. The fellowship was a brief beginning, a fair time that cannot be forgotten; and because it will not be forgotten, that fair time may come again. Now once more I must ride with my knights to defend what was, and the dream of what could be.
I am a fighting man and I am married to the quest. That is enough.
He has given up.
Is that Mandrake, Lord Merlin?
Can it truly be used for magic?
No. Yes, I am. I am jealous. I want to write poems about you with moonbeams, make the sea sing your name...
People make you laugh?
Flattery! Do you think I am ignorant of your stupid little games? Preying on you weakness of others. That's your power, a petty evil. Mine is great. Great plans. Impossible dreams. Laughable endings...
What's behind that beauty? A wizened, cold-hearted snake.
I am the desert, where water disappears--
One land, one king! That is my peace!
Dumb riddles, Merlin. I am your King.
I?
To kill and be king, is that all?
Well what's wrong?
What's he doing there? Teaching?
Don't you think he's too old, though? How's his health?
I didn't know that.
Yes.
Thank you your excellency.
What's this?
No. Not at all,
Not that I know of.
Want to ask him?
Look, he wouldn't have any reason to be up there in the first place.
When she's well enough, I'll ask.
I just heard them Karl.
Oh Karl, Jesus Christ Karl, don't do that.
No thanks Karl.
Good morning Mrs. MacNeil.
Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
Don't be alarmed. If it's a lesion in a way she's fortunate. All we have to do is remove the scar.
What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
Sure did.
He didn't mention her.
The priest.
Since we learned about mental illness, paranoia, schizophrenia. All the things they taught me in Harvard. Mrs. MacNeil since the day I joined the Jesuits, I've never met one priest who has performed an exorcism, not one.
Could you see her?
Nothing you could do would make it any worse.
What else?
Yes I did, I'm sorry.
Not at all. Why d'you ask?
Are you sure?
No.
Well, me and Sharon played a game in the back yard, and we had a picnic down by the river.
You like it?
I found it.
I wouldn't talk.
You like him.
Do you not like him like daddy?
Why does God let us get tired?
St. Mike's.
College president shouldn't drink. Tends to set a bad example, I figure I saved them from a big temptation.
Ah, that's good. That's all that's important. Back to business. Back to work. Bye now, Father.
No.
And I'm the Devil! Now kindly undo these straps!
That's much to vulgar a display of power Karras.
You and us.
Uh Huh.
Who are you?
Uoy era ohw.
I would like you to go quickly over to the resdence Damien, and gather up a cassock for myself, two surplices, a purple stole, and some holy water, and your copy of The Roman Ritual. The Large one. I believe we should begin.
Why?
Who places her trust in thee, my God.
Let us pray. Holy Lord, almighty Father, everlasting God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who once and for all consigned that fallen tyrant to the flames of hell. Who sent your only begotten son into the world to crush that roaring lion.
And also with you.
Do people tell you look like Paul Newman?
I've seen him.
From the psychiatric end.
Sick priest, is that it?
No I probably wouldn't.
Alright. You know who I think really did it?
The Dominicans. Go pick on them.
Are you tired?
Shove it up your ass you faggot!
Do you have an appointment?
Are you a relative?
Twelve.
Sometimes.
I don't know.
You're not going to drive!
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
Too bad.  You could use some sun. Really.
Teeth.
The sooner we do this the better, Mr. Baker.
No.
Recognize these two characters?
How we doing?
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
Fuck him.
Only by relation.  Besides, they hate me, too.
Bosen black.  Flat.
Why the interest?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
No thanks.
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
Says who?
What do you mean?
It's me.
What?
I told you.  Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
It wasn't like that.
No.
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead.  The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
It never was.
Okay, okay.  I'll call the girl.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't.  Let me run a comb though it.
She's here.
You wanna get a drink?
Two years ago.  March.
Last?
A few bars!
Okay.
Doesn't it matter to you?
I'm sorry, Frank.  All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
It won't happen again.  Scout's honor.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
She's a big girl.
Huh?
A gift.  Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels.  We, dear brother, are a fucking smash.  Yup.  They want us back.  Easter.  It seems they have this egg hunt every year.  Only not for kids. Adults.  They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn.  Then afterwards, they have a dance.  An egg dance.  Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open.  It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
Yeah.
The tenth's out.
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
No.
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity.  Publicity's publicity.  Right?
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Oh. Yeah.  It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
I set it for Wednesday.  The ceremony.  They're doing the stone today.  It's okay?  Wednesday?
Spur of the moment.
Yes, it is.
My watch is broken, too.
Don't take it personally.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
Where's my name?
Hey!
Just look.  What do you wear? A nine?
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Piece of cake.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Hey.
For the kids.  Merry Christmas, you two.  Don't forget.  We leave the twenty-sixth.
Virgins.
He's always right.  Go ahead.  Pick a virgin.
I told you, he's got the gift.  Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
Smells like fish.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Great.
Uh, well ...
Thanks, Lloyd.
I'll call you.
Job.
Shit, thank God.  You look like a creep.
You can check in on him tomorrow. Between eight and five.
Frank works hard.
He'll come around.
His kid's sick.
In and out.
Like a baby. You?
Hey, business is business.
Nothing.
I'm not upset.
Let's make a deal.  You shut up.
Who's Nina?
Ed? How many people live here?
Soap?
No kidding?
Coffee?
You don't pick your brother.
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
Another five years, huh?
Sounds big.  What's he do?
What are they?
What's a prom?
He's just feeling sorry for himself.  This is it, pal.  Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Fine.  You?
Eddie.
They never should've voted against U.S. statehood -- the scumbags.  We heard you got wasted.
Not unless you're sent to the "Clinic."
What do you expect us to do -- shut down the city, evacuate two million people on a hunch?
My place.
Better than you bleeding all over my car upholstery. Trust me, Caz, you won't be here long.
You're not holding him right ... Caz ...
So?  The procnias averano is a South American bird.  The flight here was only three hours!  And yesterday a European swallow flew by! Where the fuck are we?
Everything I say is wrong. I can't talk to her anymore.
It's important.
Something good?
Think about it, Eve! Everything he's done recently has been peculiar, right?  He's said and done things your husband would never do ...
-- I called, but I'm not Castor.  I'm your husband.
What more proof do you need?
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off.  I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Would it?
The left, I think.  Those surgeons in Witness Protection can fix things nobody's even broken yet.
I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
You said it, Jon, not me.
Vacuum-sealed globe ... shouldn't take long.
Trust me, he's already here. Get going!
I won't tell mom if you don't.
Like you know anything about it.
What?
Are you TRYING to give us away? For somebody with such a big brain, you think awfully small.
Most of the current chiefs -- they must have pretty hefty prices on their heads.
Good, because I checked your salary -- and it bites.  How the everyday working-class stiff survives in today's economy is something I'll never ...
A lot of people think you're a snitch.  It's dangerous ...
D.C.'s very high on giving you the promotion.  There's just one problem.
It didn't work out as planned. Where are you off to?
Don't I usually kiss my wife?
Wouldn't be the first time -- or would it?
Gone?
I'm not going anywhere.
Can't you see I'm trying to change?  I sent Jamie off because I wanted to be alone with you.  I wanted to see the candle-light dance in your beautiful --
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
Great.
Sure, baby -- go anywhere you want.  But I have to give you an escort.  Security reasons.
Back then -- who wasn't?
Yeah Jack, her assistant...
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited.  I want my gift to be the first one you open this year.  You know why?
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
I don’t think you’re hearing me.
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
Got it.  Good tip.
Great room...
It’s just two kids, right?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god’s sake!
Hey, I’m doing the best I can...  I’d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
She wants to have an affair with me.
Hey, is that really necessary?
The Caddy?  Why don’t you take your own damn car!
I call all you white guys "Jack."
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli...  Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
Hey...
That’s my car!  You stole my car!
Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil.
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
I don’t think so, thank you...
Very funny.  I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?
Frank.  Where’s Alan Mintz?  Is he here yet?
No, I didn’t...that’s great.
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
Funny, Jack.  I’m laughing on the inside.
Pro bono.  You don’t get paid at all.  Nobody makes a dime.  Well, bravo...
But it’s twenty degrees outside...
And...?
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
No, I’m serious...you’re really stunning...
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there’s no question about that.  But this...  ...you’ve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Do what?
Really.
I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you!  Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became.  How could you do this to me?  How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
You had a heart attack?
It’s wonderful...
What are you sure about?
I don’t think I’d fight you on that one...
Think bigger.
I’m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Hello Jack.  You don’t have to stop singing on my account...
A shelter?!  I’m the richest guy in the building...I’ve got twice the square footage you have!
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
But you’re not interested in boutique dollars...  I get it...
That’s easy. You’ve seen my car.
So we'll get egg nog.
Merry Christmas...
Yes!
I wouldn't know anything about that.
Ben, think about all the people we can help if this works --
I'm sure he's matured since then.
Ben.  This is serious.  <u>Turn around</u>.
Three days.  I was worried about you. How are you feeling?
I think I need to lie down.  Bad shrimp.
Deb, it's me.  It's still me.
I already got it.  Everything I want.
To help you.  I've run every test known to man.  And they all yield the same result: <u>the machine is ready</u>.
And you can?  Power it up?
Ben!  Ben!
You've been working out.
Act.  Here we go again.  Reed, what if we got these gifts for a <u>reason</u>?  What if we have some, you know...like, calling?
I don't know if "we've" noticed, but the sickest runs this side of the Alps are <i>right outside that window</i> --
Last one down springs for room service.
<u>Please</u> tell me you go silent too.
Okay, "mom."
Grow up, Johnny.  You want to run around <u>on fire</u> for the rest of your life?
<u>Girl</u>...?!
Yeah, for the last time, I hope.  I'm done with this freak show.  I'm moving back to the real world.
Showtime.
Recording, sir.  We see you perfectly.
Top left, like you asked.  Today Wall Street.  Tomorrow, who knows...maybe Washington.
Hilarious.
He's had some kind of...reaction to exposure from the cloud.  And he's not the only one.
Which is precisely the <u>point</u>. Analysis is over.  It's time for <u>action</u>.  My men could have mass- produced this by now.
It's been changed.
Great minds think alike.
Passion.
We need to get past them.
What...?  <u>Oh</u>.
Anger.  Rage.  Frustration.
I'm sure I can come up with something.
Are you kidding?
No.  There weren't.  There was <u>you</u>. And <u>me</u>.  No variables, no math.  It was actually the simplest thing in the world.  But your head got in the way... like it always does.
Every variable but <u>yourself</u>.  You don't eat, sleep.  You can't live in your head like --
Right, of course, the company... But you see, I've come to realize all the accomplishments in the world mean nothing without someone to share them with --
Susan.  What are you doing?
We understand your concern, but we've made our decision, Doctor. Any questions? Anybody?
Phase Two.
The less time, the better.
In his comatose state...and everything slowed down...no more than sixty seconds.
Message to Proteus.
It means killing Benes...  And for all we know, they may have completed the operation!  Damn it to hell!
The Other Side got to him.
What can I do? Except maybe pass out?
And take a little trip with them...
Grant, our Miniaturizer can shrink anything.
Yes...slowed down agreat deal.
It must have been jarred loose during the whirlpool.
Yes, Cora.
No danger of an embolism. At our reduced scale, they're much too minute to prove fatal to Benes.
I've been with him since I got out of school. He brought me into the CMDF, over five years ago.
Not working for someone like Dr. Duval --
I always thought it was nothing but red.
As obvious as that? Our Security people will jump for joy.  I suppose Duval's onto me, too?
Depends on which end of the telescope you look through.
Not in a sealed vessel like an Artery.  Captain -- something must be wrong with your controls!
Yes...
Take a close look at your Soul, and your Infinity, and your God out there --
You left something out.
Oxygenation...
Then why not take it?
Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
How are you, Miss Peterson?
It lays down quite a barrage in a lifetime. Forty million beats.
If those Corpuscles can take on air, no reason why we can't.  All we have to do is hook up the snorkel to that air chamber you were talk1ng about, and when Benes inhales, there should be plenty of pressure to force the oxygen into the tank.  How's that sound to you, Skipper?
Walt for the lull -- between the time he inhales and exhales.
They'll still be able to track us by radar, because of the radioactive fuel.
Send the following message...
His Pleura's in fine condition. It should be clear sailing through this area.
You still never know what's going on in anyone's mind...
Two in a row?
Once time's up, De-Miniaturization begins. In a matter of seconds the ship will grow big enough to become a danger to the System. Then White Corpuscles will swarm to destroy it, as they would any invader.
I thought I was on my vacation... What's it all about?
It should work -- theoretically. If it doesn't, the mission's off. The craft's nuclear-powered. Except for your wireless.
Positions, please. And strap yourselves in.
Enough to breathe, but that's all.
Remember -- we can't take more than five minutes to get out.
Dr. Michaels... He went berserk...
Oh -- sure, sure! Never better!
What I was afraid would happen. The stuff we passed through -- that looked like seaweed --
On the Repeater.
Looks simple to operate.
I'll guide you, once we're in the Heart.
Was there any damage?
I decided not to - I'm, uh, not taking the trip as it turns out.
I just pulled in here. I just fucking pulled in here!
Unghh... oh, geez...
I don't know. Few munce.
Or your fucking wife, Jerry.
Yeah, you already said that.
I'm not gonna debate you, Jerry.
Well, that's, that's, I'm not go inta, inta - see, I just need money. Now, her dad's real wealthy -
Oh, geez.
The heck d'ya mean? What a you guys got yourself mixed up in?
This was s'posed to be a no-rough stuff-type deal -
Well, I'm sorry, but I just - I -
Don't you fucking but me, Jerry.  I want you with this money on the Dayton- Radisson parking ramp, top level, thirty minutes, and we'll wrap this up.
Oh, for Christ's sake, where's my goddamn checkbook. Let's get this over with.
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Oh, yah, I know that!
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
Uhn.
Look, Dad, there is no fucking way -
...Babe the Blue Ox?
Yah, like I told ya, we haven't had any vehicles go missing.
The car's not from our lot, ma'am.
Well, I would know. I'm the Executive Sales Manager.
Thank you, hon. How's Fargo?
This is Reilly Deifenbach at GMAC. Sir, I have not yet received those vehicle IDs you promised me.
My patience is at an end.
We been sitting here an hour.  I've peed three times already.
Sure, Jerry, we're all set. Why wouldn't we be?
No, but, Wade, see, I was bringin' you this deal for you to loan me the money to put in. It's my deal here, see?
No! They said no cops! They were darned clear on that, Wade! They said you call the cops and we -
...There's a million dollars here!
Yah?
You had breakfast yet, Margie?
Yah...
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Yah.
No motels registered any tan Ciera last night. But the night before, two men checked into the Blue Ox registering a Ciera and leavin' the tag space blank.
Yah, I'm down in the Twin Cities and I was just watching on TV about these shootings up in Brainerd, and I saw you on the news there.
Just a Diet Coke.
Oh, yah, couple years now. It's actually Eden Prarie - that school district. So Chief Gunderson, then! So ya went and married Norm Son-of- a-Gunderson!
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Yah, is this Marge?
Margie Olmstead?
What'd he say?
His wife?
No. No. They never married.  Mike's had psychiatric problems.
Yah, it's over the wire, it's everywhere, they'll find 'em.
Love ya, Margie.
Yah?
Yah.
I love you, Norm.
We called his house; his little boy said he hadn't been there.
She's visiting relatives in Florida. Now his boss, this guy Gustafson, he's also disappeared. Nobody at his office knows where he is.
His wife's in the hospital, has been for a couple months. The big C.
Well, they're all out on the wire. Well, you know...
Congratulations, Jerry.
He's at Norstar.
Well -
Well... Why don't we...
I'm sorry, I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Six months ago, Bob's testicles were removed.  Then hormone therapy.  He developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen.  That was where my head fit -- into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of God's as big.
Some of it, yes.
Yes?
This is... really a shock...
Can't you give me something?
Sure.
What?
Practicing what?
Candy-stripe a cancer ward.  It's not my problem.
You can't have the whole brain!
Then, take blood parasites.  It's yours.  Now we each have three.
The girl had done her homework.
What... ?
It suits you.
Goodbye.
Here.
Feel anything?
Can I come in?
What?
Because the answer's "yes" or because the answer's "no?"
We did make love?
What... ?
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom.  I thought they were going to break my arm.
Give me a minute, Marla, alright... just sixty seconds.
I'm sorry, but I...
You fucking slut!!
... You know me?
Yeah, uh huh... yeah?  Oh...
I wasn't really dying, I wasn't host to cancer or parasites; I was the warm little center that the life of this world crowded around.
Pardon me?
Oh, yeah, you gotta start making the list.
This time maybe get a widescreen TV. You'll be occupied for weeks.
So, you called me up, because you just wanted to have a drink before you... go find a hotel?
You're welcome.  But, I want you to do me one favor.
I want you to hit me as hard as you can.
Only a hummingbird could have caught Tyler at work.
I don't know, either.  I want to find out.  I've never been hit, have you?
Where do you want it?  In the face?
Like hell.  That counted.
Call what off?
After I graduated, I called him long distance and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "Get a job."  When I turned twenty-five, I called him and asked, "Now what?"  He said, "I don't know. Get married."
A generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we really need.
What car?
Soldier of Fortune.  Business Week. New Republic.
He was obviously able to handle it.
Yes, I promise.
"The liberator who destroyed my property has re-aligned my paradigm of perception."
No, what you're feeling is premature enlightenment.
Fuck damnation.  Fuck redemption.  We are God's unwanted children, with no special place and no special attention, and so be it.
Imagine how he feels.
You know what I mean.
What are you doing?!
Nothing.
If the applicant waits at the door for three days without food, shelter or encouragement, then he can enter and begin training.
Why do people think I'm you?
Why do people think I'm Tyler Durden?
Answer me, Tyler.
What are you talking about... ?
And, sometimes you control it...
But, when you fall asleep, I do things without you...
I'm not going...
Stop finishing...
Since when is Project Mayhem about murder?
If you know, I know.
I think this is about where we came in.
i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...
Fifteen seconds now.  Can you see alright?  10... 9... 8....
Paraffin.  Your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin.  I saw it floating in the bomb. 
Why what?
I swear on my life, I won't...
You told me you'd say that.
What he wanted?  Look... look at him. Look at him!  What does he want?  This is a person.  This is not a cog in your machine...
No, please, no, God, no!
I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up... I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me.
Signs?
You were there?
Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition?
What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn?
I don't think so.  Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we tried to change it.
Speed up.
I have to save Eugene!
Taken care of.
Random, sure.
Your entire world view just went out the window.  I couldn't expect a religious conversation overnight. We'll get through this.  I promise.
That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all This chapter of the screenplay contains scene that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie. In order to maintain the integrity of the screenplay, it has not been edited.
Carter.
What about you, Kimberly?  Did you anyone from Flight-?
Yeah.  Who does he think he is? Knight Rider?
Blow me.  Yellow means go, Kimmy.
Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season.
Evan Shaeffer's dead.
We have to tell her she's in danger!
Who is this guy, anyway?
Yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.
Get ready to smile, five guys per girl.
How does a nice mature fuck sound?
Highway to Hell, Highway to Hell.
I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance.
You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card?
Hey, Dad.  What's up?
Who am I, David Blane?
Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'.
I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere.
Ohmygod! OHMYGOD!  OHMYGOD!  He's not dead?
Easy, Billy, just open it.
Get out! Get out of the car!
I wish you were on the plane!
I don't.
Look, there's something you should all know.
Dude, get wisdom. We're about to board a seven hour flight. The toilets in coach are barely ventilated closets. What if your body wants that airplane food out of your system and you have to go torque a wicked cable and then right after you walks in Christa or Blake?  You want them to associate with you with that reflexive gag and the watery sting in their eyes?
Oh, you've noticed it, too?
Billy! I'm gettin' a vision!  You're the next one...
'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya!
No one's that strong.
May as well go out under my own free will, right?
That's right, buddy.
Clown?  Now back up there, buddy...
This is state-of-the-art firepower.
Where's your stuff?
There are no worse places.
Who cares?  Let's just do it and get out.  Go have a Jacuzzi and get laid in Bangkok.  Know what I mean?
Alright.  Home run.
Bastards.  Let's get some shots.
I suppose you have...
You take pictures and split.  I'm going in.
I go up to this camp two months ago. Nobody there.  Empty for years.
They heard about escaped prisoner on radio.  Make deal.  More than we pay.
Rambo.  NVA coming.  Pig dog Kinh say meet them here.  Whole garrison from Con Cuong is out.
Took bus, most of way.  I knew you would come here.
Carefully.  Don't want to get shot by you.  Bad karma.  Anyway, you need me.
How?
Let's get that tent down!
Well, if there weren't POWs before, there are now.
I'm authorized to get you out of here.  I thought that's what you wanted.
Classic special forces op... hit fast... in and out.  Two men.  Two days.
Not yet.
We just take pictures?
I was crossed-trained in gunships.
That's right.
Sir, there's something else... a TRANSAT relay.  Just came through.
About 22 hours on site.
The League of Families leans on Congress.  Then they lean on us. Like we don't have enough to worry about in a dozen dirtwater countries.  Damnit!
It was clean.  Very clean... Rambo was a decorated Vietnam vet, a former POW himself... if he came out and said "No POWs" the sub-committee would buy it.  He gets himself caught he's a private citizen, a whacko, acting on his own.  If he gets proof, it gets lost somewhere between here and D.C.  Airtight. But no... Rambo's gotta be a hero. Thinks he's starring in his own war movie or something.  He put me in a corner.  No choice.
That's a crock.  We don't say that. Do you have any idea the shitstorm if he'd gotten back with that guy? If it went public?  The White House would have to act through channels. We're talking ransom.  Four billion bucks in war reparations to Vietnam to get the others back.  That's billion, Colonel.  With a "B".  For a few guys that've had their brains in a blender for ten years?  A pain in the ass to everybody?  No way. There's no way.
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
This food's delicious.  You're a wonderful cook.  And you have a lovely home.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
You still believe in God?
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
Thank you very much.
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
I didn't know.  I just said all I want is some time.
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
He can't hear you.  Hi...I'm Dr. Weintraub....  I was on duty when they brought him in...I've been going over his record... He was brought in once before I understand...  ..."catatonic  stupor"...condition  rendered him non-verbal for a period of -...
Okay... I know but... I met this beautiful girl...
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Well,... I'm a singer by trade... Summer stock...nightclub revues... that kind of thing...It used to be what I absolutely lived for...God...I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one night...in the middle of singing "Funny..... - it suddenly hit me... ...what does all of this really mean?  That, and the fact that all my friends are dead...God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.
NO...I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!
It was a crime.
You're so witty.  I'm so jealous... I <u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
Lydia.  Lydia what?
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
I know a great place.  ...UH...WARREN!
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
They're --  -- What?
I'm not...  Now, where are those shoes...
I know!  You can't imagine how surprised I was.  Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
Parry... I'm Jack.
Thanks a mill --  And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack.  Give my love to the wife and kids.
Funny -- you look married.
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
Fifty dollars?
Well what am I gonna do with it?
Who?
Bingo!
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
Sure...
What are the other reasons?
I know!
<u>Nothing!</u> <u>They</u> <u>can</u> <u>do</u> <u>nothing!</u> <u>Gentlemen!</u>
Got any Ethel Merman?
What a gyp.
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
Divorced.
Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers...  An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
I got accused a robbin' a fillin'station down in the Indian Nation, didn' I tell you...
No, dammit, I would easy.
Will you just do what the hell I tell you...
I hope they do.
You treat me like I was.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
Okay...
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
Fill it up.
Who?
It's just filthy. People are dirty. I think that's the biggest thing that's wrong with people. I think they wouldn't be as violent if they were clean, because then they wouldn't have anybody to pick on... Oofh... Dirt...
Shut up.  You have bread, don't you, and a toaster of some kind?
I didn't get it, did I?
I know what it comes with, but that's not what I want.
Yeah. I want you to hold it between your knees.
Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
Don't, then.
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
Oh, well, what, what's he...
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
What?
Yeah, well, he's...
My turn.
I didn't want to say goodbye to anyone.
What have I been doing? Different things, different jobs, here and there. Nothing that interesting.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
Is he?
I hope it will, yes.  I'm sorry.
What?
Thanks, Carl...
That's what I mean...
No, I don't, I uh... it got burned up. Everything in the car got the shit burned out of it. All I got left is what I have on...
Well, you're a romantic, Catherine, as are most musicians, and what's more, about to be married...
That's an old maid's tale.
I wouldn't be a waitress. They're nasty and full of crap.
Well, she was.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
There's a rumor that you were tryin' to get somebody to beat me up.
Then I want you to go to whoever's sayin' that and tell them to stop.
I'm wit' Carlos.
Hi.
Um. Yeah! Shorty!
You look good.
Yo, Carlos-I'm gonna punch you.
I can't man, I'm punished!
C'mon.
Eddie from Compost?
No, c'mon, stop playin'. The girl that you kissed when we got there. Where s he live at?
She lives near Eddie?
How old is he?
Yeah.
Positive.
I'm a good friend of hers.
Yo, I know what you're thinking, that I'm one of those guys that keep coming up to her.
Nah.
Utah?  Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face.
He never leaves the beach, Fat Sam. Never leaves. Sits in that chair, he's outta junk. Then he suddenly gets up, he's got junk. So where does it come from? Through the sand?
You should have seen what she wanted to do with the place. Mauve.  So what's your name?
I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men.
Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great.
Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column.
Not at all, Chief. But next time... no tongue, okay?
Thank God, the police.
We play tennis at the club.
He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some shit?
I'm serious, Sam.
Have you got a make-shift plywood pillory? Heh Heh, just kidding.
I hate to conduct business on the lanai. Why don't we step inside.
She doesn't need the money, for crissakes. She's living with Monty. I know it.
My lawyer was a bum.
You may be right.
That's history, Fletch. You owe us nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
This is no joke. If some kind of payment isn't made, we're going to have to contact the paper and garnish your wages.
Because I trust you, Alan. By the way, the name's Fletcher. I.M. Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe.
I'd have been long gone.
How similar in build you and I are. Then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up.
Whoops.
Boy, what the hell's the matter with you?
Where are you going?
Because I'm a newspaper reporter and I'm nailing Chief Cummings as the source for drugs on the beach. You're in big trouble, Gummy.
Fletch, I never sold nothing.
I dunno. Somewhere in South America, I forget.
Yeah. Maybe.
Will this proposition entail my dressing up as Tina Turner?
Charmed.
Come inside.
I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
Sure, all drifters do.
Take it where?
Sure.
I wonder if that's his doctor.
You kidding? I got an unbelievable story here, Lar. Un-believable. Jesus. It's the cops, I know it. The Chief! And they're all over Frank.
Check every hotel in L.A. Start with the ones near the airport. Yeah. He's about to leave the country with her. Thanks, Lar.
Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some.
I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are.
It's Scotch-Rumanian.
So were my parents.
I'm such a heel. How'd you guess?
Yes.
It's amazing.
Just like Alan. It's freaky.
Stop it.  Are you saying my husband is defrauding me?
I checked. There was no divorce.
Yes, I'm with the Underhills.
I work for the landlord. He told me to watch out for the place.
Who are you?
She moved out.
And a damn fine one, I might add.
Irwin, professional journalism time, now. Go back to the goddamn beach and finish the goddamn story!
I don't know.  Look!
Who? Donnie and Marie?
You know, I've had it up to here with your bullshit. I need a story from you by tomorrow.
Of course.
Who's your decorator?
Fag?  Ass?  I'm sorry, is that a joke?
What did these Vancouver factories do?
I guess I'm not interested in any club who'll have my member as a member.  Later, Don...
Cash or check, Jazz?  Don't do this to me.
Fucking Australians!  I hate that country, continent, what is it? Don't we do nuclear testing there?
Car insurance costs money. Cavities cost money.  Doritos cost money.  I'm gonna eat that damn bear... come here!
Ah -- ha... You know, you should think about dating Earthmen again.
Keep it.  It's your paycheck this month.
I found a lot of Art Mooneys. None with a police record, though. Not even Synchronicity.  Have you checked out Johnny Pinzolo/Crunch's houseboat yet?
No, as a matter of fact you didn't. What about the girl, Zuzu Petals, how does she fit in?  I mean, she is what this case is about.
Make eye contact when you say that.
Su-ure.  Two people hired me to find Zuzu in order to get hold of one of those discs and Colleen threw a tizz when we took hers.  Obviously, all this binary disc shit is pretty mighty.  But it's not necessary.  People are dead.  One was a friend.  The same people were involved in a scam to rip off Grendel Records. Bottom line's Julian Grendel is doing a little revenge number...
Seems to be information about a factory in Vancouver.
Let's get hitched.  I guess I, you know, love you.  It's a beautiful thing.
Scalping to a funeral, you're a pretty sleazy guy.
What?
Peachy.
I'm so sure!  I'm an only child and my parents are Bill and Shirley Petals of South Bend, Indiana. They run a hardware store and...
I dunno.  He was to sound what Cezanne was to image or at least I thought so.  Ever since he died, I've been chased... <u>Omigod</u>!
Stop.  We still got serious detective stuff to do, but we've been up all night so we should hit the sack for...
Okay?  I just blew up.  I feel orgasmic.
Ye-ah.  Sure.
Ye-ah.
But you know, that was just a dream.  Doesn't really count.
ArtArtArtArtMooneyMooneyMooney Mooney.
Just be thankful he wasn't dissatisfied with his sex life.
Tell me, Dr. Watson, what makes you think he's not just another piece of shit overdose.
Did he just say what I think he said?
You need it.
And hey, I appreciate it...
Who's my real father, man?
Shut the heck up... Pop.
I was about to say he looked like shit, but hey, sure, he looked like you.
You were the lead sing -- Lieutenant, I didn't think anyone could cheer me up tonight... Thanks.  Really.
Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies.  The Village People rotted your brain.
I guess you never saw 'A Very Brady Christmas.'
I'm off it!
<u>I.  Am.  The.  Biggest.  Sissy.</u> <u>In.  The.  Whole.  Fucking.  World</u>.
Boing.  You're one hell of a lip reader.
Mmmmmmm.  Mmmm, mmm.
Before Black Vomit starts its set, Don will have his head blown off. The papers next week will reveal that he was partners with Bobby, Johnny, and Collie in 'the Grendel Records scam.'  He killed them to pay off a debt to 'the mob' or something lame like that.  And then the mob iced him.  It's all more tasteful than it sounds.
Oh, wait.  One sec.  Open the window.
What is this, are you holding a microphone behind my head?
Accident?  Accident!  You naive pussball, when I realized my life of music could only be a life of music industry.  I <u>cut my fucking</u> <u>ears off</u> so I'd only hear <u>my</u> music. Here, look.
I'll tell you when somebody pays me to give a shit and stuff.
Hey, the poet...
Hebedeebuh.  Hebedeebuh.  Maybe I did die in the explosion.
It is to us!  It's computerised.
I don't take cases with foundations in bullshit.  They are very hard to walk around in.
What?
Boca?
No, nothing.  There's only some talk.
You know I hadda meet some people tonight --
I don't know where I'm gonna find a pizza joint open.
Yeah?
Fuck you, Santa Claus!
Did you ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
Were you ever in Poughkeepsie?
Enchanté.  Alain, j'ai réfléchi à votre proposition et j'ai décidé d'accepter.
Are you having trouble raising the half million?
Non!
Il fallait le faire.
Most New Yorkers never notice it - most Americans have never heard of it.
Marseilles.
Yeah, I know.
Willie Mays.
Hey, Mutch!  You want bacon?
Strike out, eh?
The Westbury?  Balls.  I got him down at the subway at Times Square. What the hell's goin' on?  I make him coming right out of the hotel free as a bird.  Not a soul awake.
Not a chance.
What for -- you wanna play Hide the Salami with his old lady?
Make it Alexander's, I like the toy department.
Tell everybody we'll be back in an hour.
The crazy kid handcuffed me to the bed.  With my own cuffs.
Sixty days.  Here.  Don't mention it.
Pour it in your ear.
Just for mistakes of parking?
For garbage?
Joel, don't jerk me.  I spent a lot o' time settin' this one up.
I been damn careful up to now.
I'm straight, Joel.  They haven't got shit on me.  Look, I'm tellin' you, he'll take the deal somewhere else.
Elvis has left the building.
One in each ear.  What would you do without me?
He ain't the only one.
I'm serious.
Luck, my ass.
I'm sorry, Frank, but you need to come outside.
Okay, okay.  I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
Uh, huh...  Uh, huh.  And you got this from the guy you were talking to on the radio when I came in?
Uh, huh.
Go watch the game?  Go watch the fucking game?  Frank, they're gonna make you for Sissy Clark's murderer.  It matches the Nightingale's profile.  You understand what that means?
No kidding.  I'm on the corner of 65th and CPW.  Come get me.
Daddy put the wheels back on.  I'm gonna fall.
Daddy, I'm scared.
No, but we can.  We can do it together. Spirit and guts, Chief.
Wait...
Look, I don't really remember how this thing works.
Yeah.  It was all over after Buford nailed Seaver's first pitch outta the park.
Wasn't too tough, buddy.  Game happened almost thirty years ago.
Frank...Frank Sullivan.
What?
I'm dreaming this.  Shit, this is a dream.
Nothing...I just spilled something.
What if it's not...
Johnny...?
I don't know.
Sun spot?
I'm thirty-five years old.
I'm not doing anything.  Look, I don't know what's going on.  But I swear on my life, I"m here at your old desk, on your Ham, in our house, right now...in 1998.
I lost you.
I never knew you, Dad.
Tomorrow.  Jesus...it hasn't happened. It doesn't have to happen.
I don't understand.
Tell me.
I'm glad.
Something happened, something...
He didn't just kill three women anymore. He killed ten.
I don't know...  What about the other women?
They will if they catch him in the act. You can make that happen, Dad.  You can tail the victim and call it in at just the right moment.
Tell 'em there's a homicide in progress... cause by the time they show up there will be.
Sissy Clark, 190 Riverside Dr., apartment 3C.  Tomorrow.  She's a nursing student.  Paying her way as a cocktail waitress at the Peppermint Lounge, on west 63rd.  Left work at two A M...killed in her apartment, between two thirty and five.
Didn't happen, we got enough problems down here.
What...
Hang on.
We did it, John.  We stopped him.
What's wrong?
What the hell is that smell?
Whoa, I just...I just...
Gordo, I wasn't dreaming.  I talked to him, it was real.
Ten?  No.  I remember this case.  Three. He killed three women.
April 16...?  That means she was the first.
Yeah.  Sure.
Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
Hey, Ma, it's me.  Checking in.  Probably at work.  Anyways, I'll see you tomorrow night.  Love you.
Yeah, those grad school applications are driving her crazy.
Oh, I loved it.  I wish you'd gone.
You work too hard, John.
I try to be.
You have the right to remain silent.  If you give up that right...
Where are you going?
Actually, I have no idea what the World's Record is.  I was just kidding.
Cool it, Andy.
I don't know...
Sounds disgusting.  Let's go.
I vote for me.
Barely.
Chuck... look.
Will you come with me?
Okay, we won't.  We'll just have fun, all agreed?
I'm sorry.  I just wanted to surprise you.  What can I say?
You're irresistible.  I lose control.
Did you stay here last night?
I'm serious.  Doesn't this look a little strange to you?
I'm trying.  I'm really trying.
Destroy the evidence, Pronto!
Just keep your eyes on the road.
A few minor repairs and it'll be as good as new.
No way...  ...I wanna rock!
Why?
We're gonna scare him?!
He really believes Jason's still alive, doesn't he?
You don't know for sure.  What about Roy?  Nobody's seen him.
This is taking forever.  I'm starving.
You watch that smart-mouthing, young lady.
He is.  Only Tommy wants to prove the legend is true...  ...You stay put.  And I'm not kidding.
We have!  Trying to track you down.  The phone there is disconnected.
Daddy, what is going on?
Tommy, my father is out looking for you right now.  Something happened tonight and he's sure you're responsible.  If he finds you, he'll...
No.
'Cause it stinks.
Come and get it.
I found it outside.
Are they grown-ups?
Are you ready?  He's taken our young men off to teach them my favorites sport.
Will you listen, dammit!
There's no time for this bullshit...
No!...  ... You kids better leave.  This boy here is not well and I need to talk to him in private.
But they have to be warned, Sheriff.  Jason will return to the area that's familiar.  No matter what you call it, it's still Camp Crystal Lake to him.
They coulda danced a jig on it an' fed it to goats -- don't matter.  Ya' can't kill Jason by gettin' rid of his body.  He'll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the darkness and crush their little skulls -- maybe even your skull, Mr. Campbell.
Skin stretcher was human.
-- yeah, yeah, yeah.  You just have your hundred grand ready.  For that you get the machete...the mask...the whole damn thing.
Do you have to ask?
Take him to my car.  I'll be out in a minute.
Information like that is very expensive and you don't have the balls to pay the price.
Yeah...
Until I hear the truth.
The truth?  That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
About what?
Never.
Disgusting?  Bingo night was sold out for six months after that!  They raised enough money to build a day care center.
Sounds good. I hear there's a shuffleboard court on deck -- it might be kinds cool...
Rennie's not coming.
It's...dead.
Jim Miller and Suzy Donaldson never showed up. I'm a little concerned.
And neither do you. It's up to Rennie to decide what she wants to do.
That lunatic has been spouting off about Jason since we boarded...  It's no coincidence.
She's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.  Has he brought it back on course yet?
He's the son of the Captain, for Chrissakes. You'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!
You can and you will! Swim, Rennie!
I don't even know why I'm afraid, Uncle Charles. I can't even remember when it started. Don't you think it's time I found out and got over it?
I don't know what to say...
Yeah...a lot.
There's something I haven't told you...
The LORAN has a digital printout of your latitude and longitude. Give me the coordinates and we'll be there as quick as we can.
I want to go home. I want off this ship.
What do you mean???
Where are they?
I'm not going near any lifeboat!
Very big.
You are going where?
Very bad today.
That's where I peed.
Paisley Porter. I didn't know you were waiting tables.
Shut up, Elliot.
Don't needle me, Elliot. Tell me how bad you feel. We're suppose to feel bad together. This is what friends do.
It is just a review. Do not inhale. Very dangerous.
Before his Broadway days. He reviewed the one-act I did at the Fulton Fish Market. We did this play at four AM, outdoors in the rain. One performance. For the fish handlers.
Where is it?
Paisley Porter.
About an hour and a half ago. I saw her come out of a place. She said she was visiting a friend. But she wouldn't tell me who.
She was very evasive.
What are you talking about?
This could be it.
Our Peter?
The Red Sox blow a chance to win their first World Series since 1918. You expect me to miss that for an opening night?
I go to college. I thought you knew.
That's completely crazy.
And he hears it the same time I hear it? What happened to family secrets?
I have a class. I'm late.
First you tell me.
And Peter Redmond helped immensely. These pauses were exquisitely timed. He made us wait and wait. He built a gorgeous tension and suspense.
We stranded five runners in the first two innings. This will come back to haunt us.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
That's very lovely actually.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
This could be it!
It was rummy, not poker. But I'll take a chance and let you in.
Five's not so many. There were families with seven kids. A grandmother. A dimwit uncle.
They're only gonna lose.
The Red Sox are your problem. I never understood about you and the Red Sox. Everybody rooted for the Yankees.
Since when did that matter?
My back is killing me.
I can't find it.
Normal boy's ambition. I like coming back. You know that.
Show him who we are.
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
Wife and daughter. My father's still alive. He outlives me, starting tonight. Because the Mets just tied the score. It was only a matter of time, wasn't it?
I don't know Toyota. What does he do?
Winning is easy. Losing is complicated. It's a lifetime's work.
I want to say it because my whole life may depend on these next few moments.
No. They're not your team. They're my team.
You're out of bullets.
Joanna loves this play. She has sunk tons of money. She is completely Ncommitted.
To go to the theater. Wears I don't know what. Make-up, padding.
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
The fact is, I have to get going.
And I thought, at last, she's here, she wants me.
They are boys. -- And they're Indian.
Are you sure?
"I will follow you in all our vows and duties."
Jinnah has -- has cooperated with the British. It has given him power and the freedom to speak, and he has filled the Muslims with fears of what will happen to them in a country that is predominantly Hindu.  That I find hard to bear -- even in prison.
I'm simply going to prove to Muslims there, and Hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts -- and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.
Yes. I've -- I've met some very remarkable people in India... and -- and when I read what you've been doing here, I -- I wanted to help.  Does that surprise you?
I think you do.  But I thank God we all don't.
No, no -- just a moment, please.
I thought you were against fighting.
The Government's afraid, and they don't know what to do. But they're more afraid of terrorists than of you. The Viceroy has agreed to your release if you will speak for non- violence.
Panditji -- please, help me.
I say when is now -- and we will determine how.
Hm.  Is it?
I --
That's young Nehru. He's got his father's intellect, his mother's looks and the devil's charm. If they don't ruin him at Cambridge -- Wave! Wave! -- he may amount to something.
I'm hardly that, Mr. Patel.
There is nothing I can give.
No. You were the surprise. It's been all over the prison. We thought they'd be too afraid of the English press.
My wife publicly defied the law. They've arrested her and four others.
Don't worry -- I've never seen men so determined. You've given them a way to fight... And I don't think --
I dined at the prison.
Very well.
He's "discovering" India.
Have you found him?
Come with me now, Vincent.  You've gone as far as you can go.
It's over.
I like football.
Who knows with these "deficients"?  His profile indicates a proclivity for violence.
A customer?  Does this Michael's cater to misfits?
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
Luca could still be an accomplice.
We have to be certain.  Once they're up, we can hardly turn the boat around.
What a relief.
Thank you, no.
No, but since there aren't too many <i>live</i> ones tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep.  If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.  I think you'd better get some people out of bed, Detective.  In the meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
Where is your head, Jerome?  You're acting like a guilty man.  They won't marry the eyelash to you.  They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
She's already got her doubts.  I have to act like nothing's wrong.
You may as well invite her here.
Have you forgotten?  I don't need any samples where I'm going.
We want him--we were hoping he would get married and have children.  We'd like grandchildren.
Antonio, the choir...
German, is that you?
How do I square the accident?
I'd have to bleach my hair.
You worried about the cost?
No.
I guess somebody beat me to it.
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender.  Looked right instead of left.
That's precisely what <i>scares</i>me--that they won't do anything <i>foolish</i> or <i>courageous</i> or <i>anything</i>--worth a Goddamn.
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
Not like <i>this</i> one.
I get my own help.
They're mine. The one with the moustache is my brother. They stay out of it. We stay clean.
They may nail me into this now, McCoy.
I bet.
I'm a lot better off than I was an hour ago.
Yeah.
Small town, small bank, big money.
Better than old times.
Assumed name... Houston.
That Beynon's got a long arm.
Pretty good... Made a quick trip to Oregon, saw my brother and the kids. Figured it would be my last chance, unless they wanted to travel.
No. It's been a long time.
After four years and now the question comes up.
We've got time. We've got a lot of time. I can help you.
If we are clean Gollie will take us over at Nogales. If we are hot we'll have to try Laughlin at El Paso.
If it's funny I'm going to laugh.
At least you were outside.
I know you do. But it is different.  It's different.  We'll be all right tomorrow.
We're going to have a lot of those,  We're just going to get the money and then go all the way.
Call the ranch, tell Beynotr we'll leave his cut here --
I've never "been there... When we met it was in his office.
I just figure the percentages. He wouldn't try a cross until he's got the money.
If we make a mistake., he'll burn us. You make a deal, you're always better keeping your end up.
You sent me to him.
It isn't another boyfriend, is it?
No... there's a couple of things I'm still working on.
Why, there's nothing on the news?
If Beynon bought him out, and he talked then maybe Beynon's boys will be waiting for us in El Paso.
I'll tell you something, Doc. One day you're going to have to trust somebody...
I think so... I don't know.
Either we pick it up or else we leave it right here. We got to go one way or another.
I don't see how.
Great. I'm going to sleep twelve hours.
We walk.
Utah, the Bee-Hive state. I'm from Orem, right near Salt Lake ... Say, you wouldn't happen to be a Mormon, would you?
Tell her you robbed a bank...
Might try that.
What about the vault?
Aren't we going a little hard?
He took the day off.
Mexico. I'd like to find a quiet place to cross.
I kinda doubt it.
Sure thing, mister, it's coming right up. 'Bout an hour. Quiet crossing that is.
Not now.
After you come back I'll listen while you make some phone calls, tell a few friends you've got to leave for a week or two... You have to call another Vet about the animals. You tell him to come over and take good care of them starting tomorrow... no slip-ups on that. They got to be looked after...
How?
What happened to this car?
This is my brother's car.
Was the steering faulty?
What?
That's nice.
Fine...  I want to talk to you.
What do you mean? You've been Frank's bird ever since her mother cleared off. You're closer to her than anyone.
Killed?  I don't know anything about it.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
He was all right to me.
Nicer than most.
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not.  Why all the bloody needle?
It's the truth.
Yes, I do.
Go on.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Not entirely. No.
Expect so.
Working at Woolworths.
Yeah.
Thanks.
What?
Since when did he drink whisky?
Where you off to?
How'd you find me?
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
Very nice.  I'll pay you for tonight as well.
Don't ask me.
That little shit!
What about Keith?
Making a living.
Not till I'm dead, Eric.
Sod off.
Sit down, Jack,  I could weep. I really could. Sometimes I think I'll retire. Just piss off to the Bahamas and let somebody else employ them,  Glenda, get Jack a drink. What is it, Jack?
No? Funny that. Neither did I.
Knock it off, Gerald.
Harry! Jack, I don't want to be rude, but these men have brought a lot of money with them. Glenda, you don't offer a man like Jack a drink in those piddling little glasses.  Give him the bloody bottle.  Now, where are we?
That's right.
Calling my bluff, are you, Harry?
I had to.
What?
We're stuck with this fucking shit...
It's too...
Eh?
All of, they got you on this "board..."
I know it's not.  I'll tell you, you got, you know, you got...what did I learn as a kid on Western? Don't sell a guy one car.  Sell him five cars over fifteen years.
Goddamn right, that's right.  Guys come on: "Oh, the blah blah blah, I know what I'll do: I'll go in and rob everyone blind and go to Argentina cause nobody ever thought of this before."
Eh?
...sales promotion, "You lose, then we fire your..." No.  It's medieval... it's wrong. "Or we're going to fire your ass." It's wrong.
You know who it is.  It's Mitch. And Murray.  'Cause it doesn't have to be this way.
Nurses.
Yes.
Himself?
What?
The Glengarry...the premium leads...? I'd say we got five thousand.  Five. Five thousand leads.
Yes.
We're just speaking about it.  As an idea.
As a robbery.
No.  Not actually.
What did he say?
Is that what I said?
What does that mean?
Yes.  I'm sure.
...and rob the place...
Why?  Why you going to give me five grand?
Hey, hey, let's just keep it simple, what I need is not the...what do you need...?
I lied.  Alright?  My end is my business. Your end's twenty-five.  In or out. You tell me, you're out you take the consequences.
What?  You can't do any what?
Huh?
Clear Meadows.  That shit's dead.
That's...
You hit a bad streak.  We've all... look at this: fifteen units Mountain View, the fucking things get stole.
He filed half of them, he filed the big one.  All the little ones, I have, I have to go back and...ah, fuck, I got to go out like a fucking schmuck hat in my hand and reclose the...  I mean, talk about a bad streak. That would sap anyone's self confi... I got to go out and reclose all my... Where's the phones?
Yes.  The cops.  No.
Why?  Because they're stupid. "Where were you last night..."
I was at home, where were you?
Why?
Fuck.  I had them on River Glen.
In school.
Who told me wh...?  You've got a fuckin', you've...a...who is this...?  You've got a board-up on the window...Moss told me.
I've...look.  Will someone get this guy off my back.
You call them again.  Mr. Williamson...!
Could I...
Hey, fella, let's get this done...
And let's put this together.  Okay? Shel?  Say okay.
...you didn't close...
Will you please wait a second. Shelly.  Please.  Murray told me: the hot leads...
I saw the board.  You've got four...
I'll give you thirty on them now, I'll bring the rest tomorrow.  I've got it at the hotel.  John?  We do that, for chrissake?
Because I say so.
Somebody broke in.
It's better than a good sale.  It's a...
What does that fucking mean?
It's not impossible.
You can't learn that in an office. Eh?  He's right.  You have to learn it on the streets.  You can't buy that.  You have to live it.
You listen to me, someday you might say, "Hey..." No, fuck that, you just listen what I'm going to say: your partner depends on you.  Your partner...a man who's your "partner" depends on you...you have to go with him and for him...or you're shit, you're shit, you can't exist alone...
Sure!  I robbed the office.  Sure.
I want to tell you something, Shelly.  You have a big mouth.
You've got a big mouth, and now I'm going to show you an even bigger one. 
I'm sorry.
Because I don't like you.
Shut the fuck up.  Ricky.  You have a mean streak in you...  And what the fuck are you babbling about...? 
Hey, big fucking deal.  Broke a bad streak...
Mmm.
"I want to tell you something, Harriet..."
From the store.
Yes.  I did.  This morning.  What I'm saying to you: things can change.  You see?  This is where you fuck up, because this is something you don't know.  You can't look down the road.  And see what's coming.  Might be someone else, John.  It might be someone new, eh?  Someone new.  And you can't look back. 'Cause you don't know history.  You ask them.  When we were at Rio Rancho, who was top man?  A month...?  Two months...? Eight months in twelve for three years in a row.  You know what that means?  You know what that means? Is that luck?  Is that some, some, some purloined leads?  That's skill. That's talent, that's, that's...
He's right, Williamson.
Yes.
Sure.
Didn't I say I was taking the two o'...
Kenilworth...?
Me.
Mm.
Did I...?
She called the consumer...the attorney, I don't know.  The attorney gen...they said we have three days...
I don't know, the attorney gen... the...some consumer office, um...
Yest...
It's not me, it's my wife.
You tell me again.
We'll speak to her, Jim...
She told me I have to.
I do.  If I don't get my money back...
I...
And the check is...
What, they beat you with a rubber bat?
Yeah.  He closed a deal.
You did that?
Harriet and blah blah Nyborg.
Why not?
They didn't get my contracts.
The...
The word from Murray is: leave them alone.  If we need a new signature he'll go out himself, he'll be the president, just come in, from out of town...
To do business.
I'm not hungry.
The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, &quot;The Family.&quot;
She couldn't decide.
This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line.
Connie.
Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent?
You're not my father!
Because I need MONEY!
I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael.
Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me.
A hundred years...it's a toast.
It's not talk; I'm doing it.
He will grow strong.
He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge.
 You must understand, this is all new to me...
Get a good night's sleep.  We got a new suit, new shirt, new tie, and I'm going to shave you myself. Tomorrow we want you to look respectable for fifty million of your fellow Americans.
We have a special home for you for the rest of your life.  Nobody gets near you.  You're not going any place.
Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners!
Mio fratello.
It's all right.  He stays with me all the time.
I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days.
You know her; drives me crazy, one minute she's a popsicle, the next she's all vinegar.  Sometimes I think... I think - I should a married someone, like you did.  To have kids, to have a family.
No, I didn't know.  Is he dead?
 And he agreed?
I'm going to see my parents.
You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did.
Yes.
I don't know.
I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that.
I can't let him down.
Yeah, give me a minute.
But your people... Neri... Rocco; you don't think...
But if you're wrong...
My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you.
It was a boy.
Roth engineered it, Michael.  He made Pentangeli think you hit him. Deliberately letting him get off alive.  Then the New York detectives turned Frankie over to the FBI.  My informants say he was half dead and scared stiff -- talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him.  Anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. There's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.
His medical condition is reported as... &quot;terminal.&quot;
That plane goes to Miami...
Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI.
Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you.
Mike wants it.
Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don.
The room has a bug in it.
Tom, what do I do now?
Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff.
Thanks, Tom.  Thanks.
Actually, I've come with good news; the Corleone family has done you a favor.
We know you're a busy man, with plenty of enemies -- we saw the opportunity to do you a favor, and we did.  No strings.
Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli.
He is, I believe, a brother.
This meeting is adjourned.
This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami.
Michael.
Get out of my hotel.
Your family?  How can you ever lose your family?
It means... &quot;The Lie.&quot;
I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him.
We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern.
The money was sent.
I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you?
No, I'm fine.
So?
Sure, I remember Tom from the old days.
That is a complete falsehood.
I do not.
We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war.
Then why do you want me to lay down to them?
I'm going to squeeze you, Corleone, because I don't like you; I don't like the kind of man you are.  I despise your masquerade, and the dishonest way you pose yourself and your fucking family.
No, she's here.
We worked it all out beforehand.
You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do?
We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him.
Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs.
We got no choice.
Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there.
What was that?
I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
Just thinking out loud.
All right, then.  He's interested in you for your conversation.  We know what a great talker you are.
Go wash glasses if you don't like it.
Maybe it's supposed to be funny.
What's to be jealous of?
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
I'm not a kid.
Is that all this conversation means to you?  Am I going to put out or not?
I'm keeping away.  What you are doing is no business of mine.
What kind of man are you?  Are you a good man?
Expect nothing fancy.
Tea is fine.
No.  We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I.  People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim.  You have people, Boone?
Your wife?
No.  I have children, grandchildren too.  I visit when I can.  But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much.  Poor Mr. Jimmy.  There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell.  Very sad.
No.  His is the worse.  The unspeakable.  The deed no man can name without shame?
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
What do I do?
But how're you going to explain this?  How did you get him out of the pool?
Just that I was in the Marines.
You know what they say.  If you have to ask --
In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here.
I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks.
What's to sketch?
But why?
You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time.
Hmmm.  I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man."  Shall we begin?
Your family ate dripping?
I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either.
Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays.
Proud?  Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
You don't think of me that way, do you?
Thoreau with a lawnmower.
What happened?
You've done a helluva lot more than most people.
I don't know.  I guess I like your stories.
There's no people like you in my crowd.
You must think the whole world is queer.  Well it's not.  War sure isn't.
You don't want me to sit for you anymore?
Do I look okay?
Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor.
The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster.
A very lucky thing indeed.
That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed.
I don't remember that one.
There are straps in back.
Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
I haven't done a damn thing with you!
Oh Clayton.
You only embarrass yourself.
Then who did?
But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life.
Oh dear.
Yes, Mr. Jimmy.  An interview.  After so many years. Very exciting.
Luminal.
She is beautiful.
I'd hardly call our yardman a friend.
It must be up in your old room.  I will look.
Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
Sure.
Everything.  Start at the beginning.
But it's the horror movies you'll be remembered for.
No.  I never said you were.  Or will be soon.
Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story.
Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.
Is there someplace we can talk?
Six years ...
Tell me about Kip -
No, but you dress like an asshole ...
Me, too. Every time I walk...
Were it only that easy. I have obligations. The order needs to be filled...
One more night --
How is he?
Get out of here, then. Now.
No...
Kip.
You know my back.
Something like that -
Cadillac.
Not at all ...
Good.
No. The needy. Us. Cos we need this car!
Hey, Donny --
Okay. Figure it forgotten. What's this about anyways -- ?
And there she is --
There's no one left ...
He didn't mess up. There it is ...
You, too, Ma...
How's Kip?
I couldn't. I didn't want you to worry. I thought held sort himself out. I hardly see him. He comes and goes. He's in trouble, isn't he?
You remember that, Kip?
Yes, sir -
You guys are through...
Damn crooks is everywhere --
Just hold on... Hold on ...
Something like that -
Okay --
Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm thinking --
What?
Me.
Me...
I like how you wallop back in here - after four years - and can still get all Clifford Huxtable on my shit ...
Hell, yeah... It's a beautiful business ...  I mean, no, man, it's hard, it's scary, it sucks ...
Nah.
I saw her get smashed-up on the TV. Knew there was no way he was gonna accept her ...
Ya gotta keep tabs on your "Eleanors", Memphis. Cos you never know when you're gonna need one --
Hell, yeah. She's not my unicorn.
Hospital.
Call 'em here -- ?
What are you doing here?
Nope. I got a coffee. And a boyfriend.
On account of me.
Cut 'em...
I bet you say that to all the girls...
No worries ...
Oh, yeah. For real, point-five.
If we put out the word. That we're crewing-up, for a one-time-only job... What do you think that'll yield?
No we don't -
Who's "Eleanor?"
So what's in there -- ?
Not really --
No. Come on. It was the younger one that was the bad one.
Listen to him.  "Watch the suit," he says.  A little pisser I've known all my life.  Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
Oh I Him.
Wha?  Me?
Have more coffee.  It'll wake you up.
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
I got scared.
Bring the car round back. I know a place Upstate they'll never find him.
I gotta talk to you.
Right away I knew he didn't want them. I knew I was going to get stuck for the money. I only bought the damn guns because he wanted them. And now, he didn't want them. I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was so pissed he didn't even say goodbye.
I remember feeling bad about the guy. But I remember feeling that maybe Tuddy was right.  I knew Paulie didn't want anybody dying in the building.
What for? I got a pound of stuff in my jacket I've been carrying around all day. We gotta start taping it to your leg.
There's a shovel at my mother's.
Will you get the fuck out of here.
Hey, come on. I gotta meet somebody.
It's okay. I'll make it up.  I promise. Just hurry it up a little. Okay?
He's okay. They sobered him up.
I don't want them left back.
But it isn't right, Paulie. That Tommy, he's making trouble for me all over town.  I can't go here.  I can't go there.
But, Paulie, please.
Oh shit.
That fuckin' guinea, Will knows him.
Fuck you, you fat fuck.
What are we gonna do up there?
Jesus Christ. Not even close.
Why not?
Gone.
She went to Medical school in California.
Yeah, sit in a room and do long division for the next fifty years.
Little Morgan's got a lot a scrap, dude. I'd rather fight a big kid, they never fight, everyone's scared of 'em. You know how many people try to whip Morgan's ass every week? Fuckin' kid won't back down.
So, you ladies ah, go to school here?
How you doin'?
--and he's like "shit! Motherfucker!" And he looks in his rearview and sees this cat-- I'm sorry--
And so they go around to the front of his truck...and there's another cat on the grille.
You could put a pool in that backyard.
So in the morning, there's a knock on the door it's the Statie. So my Uncle's like, "Is there a problem?" And the Statie's like "I pulled you over and you took off." And my Uncle's like "I never seen you before in my life, I been home all night with my kids." And Statie's like "Let me get in your garage!" So he's like "All right, fine." He takes around the garage and opens the door --and the Statie's cruiser is in my Uncle's garage.
Shut the fuck up.
You thought we forgot, didn't you? I know I'm gettin' my licks in.
Retainer...
History.
Good, it was all right.
Elementary? Oh, I don't doubt that it was. I remember the class, it was just between recess and lunch.
Which one's your building?
Well, he didn't show up for work today...
Hey fuck you.
Fuck do you want?
An integer.
C'mon, that guy was a fuckin' piece of work.
Okay...don't forget to get another therapist for next week.
I'm pretty sure it's right.
Sure, then you'd have more time to sit around and get drunk. Think of how many fights you could have been in by now.
Listen, I'll be nearby so, if you need some help, or you get stuck again, don't be afraid to give me a call.
Yeah, cured polio.
The Field's Medal is the Nobel Prize for math.  But it's only given out every four years.
I've been busy.
I got your card.
I need someone with your kind of background.
Five.
Cutting edge mathematics. Think tanks. The kind of place where a mind like Will's is given free reign.
--Gerry--
Hold on!
--I don't want your trophy and I don't give a shit about it! 'Cause I knew you when!! You and Jack and Tom Sanders. I knew you when you were homesick and pimply-faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!
If you push him into something, if you ride him--
He's not you!
Yeah. Summer vacation. Thought I'd travel some. Maybe write a little bit.
I got this mailer the other day. Class of Sixty-five is having this event in six months.
You're pretty quick with those numbers. How about the odds of me buying the first round?
Had one, now I'm fucked again.
Will, your not getting off that easy.
If you wanna hit "Ramrod," take your shot. Take some pride in it. You go to church? So fuckin' what, God loves you. I mean, Christ. A guy as well known as you? By the time you put your disguise on and skulk out of the house Sunday nights you probably look like "Inspector Cluseau."
What did you think?
Yeah, it did take me a long time.
How about Noam Chomsky's "Manufacturing Consent?"
You're right. It really gets in the way of my jazzercizing.
No.
This is a real piece of shit.
You ever heard the saying, "any port in a storm?"
I know what I'm doing. She's different from the other girls I met. We have a really good time. She's smart, beautiful, fun...
No, I don't.
I didn't write anything else 'cause nobody, including most of my colleagues bothered to read the first one.
Yeah.
Why? Because of the pain I feel now? I have regrets Will, but I don't regret a singel day I spent with her.
Well hell, I didn't know Pudge was gonna hit the home run.
What?
Define that.
Not to me, they're not.
I didn't want the job.
I didn't ask for this.
Cause fuck him, that's why.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Yeah, I think so.
You're Welcome, Will.
Does this violate the patient/doctor relationship?
What?
You aren't, by any chance, Pre-law? Are you?
I bet your parents were happy to pay.
Okay...
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
Well, Irish Catholic. What do you think?
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
How the hell did you do that?
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
What?
I'm not honest?
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Well, I'm contracting the land.
You trying to tell me how to run my own business?
I never knowed they was anything like her!
Sure! I was just aimin' to meet up with a couple girls I know.
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's *go* to California.
I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
Well, we ain't out a it yet.
I don't know what these cops got to do with it but I don't like it.  An' these here are our own people, all of 'em. I don't like this.
Thing's been workin' on me, what they was yellin' about. Got me all curious.
Okay. Go on.
Why, you're the preacher!
Ought to be. That's fact'ry liquor. Cost me a buck.
I don't mind any more. I'd do what I done again. I killed a guy at a dance. We was drunk. He got a knife in me and I laid him out with a shovel. Knocked his head plumb to squash.
He had a knife in me. That's why they only gave me seven years. Got out in four--parole.
I'll be glad to see you pa. Last time I seen him was at a baptizin', an' he had one a the bigges' doses of the Holy Sperit I ever seen. He go to jumpin' over bushes, howlin' like a dog-wolf in moon-time. Fin'ly he picks hisself out a bush big as a piana an' he let out a squawk an' took a run at that bush. Well, sir, he cleared her but he bust his leg snap in two. They was a travellin' dentist there and he set her, an' I give her a prayin' over, but they wasn't no more Holy Sperit in your pa after that.
That's our place.
They never wrote you nothing?
If she does it'll be a miracle outa Scripture.
You're right!
Thought you was in jail.
I aim to.
I ought to done it then--an' not come on any trip like this.
Save your strength, lady.  Get goin', buddy. No campin' here.
But this is *my land*, son. Don't you understand?
Can't you see that sticker?
Yeah.
Naw--not much!
If we broke down maybe somebody'd give us a han'.
Five they're a-gettin' now, an' that's all they're int'rested in. I know exackly what Pa'd say. He'd jus' say it wasn't none a his business.
Didn' you have no breakfast?
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
Ain't a-goin', thas all...
No longer'n we can get acrost her.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Cut it out, Ma, or I'll--
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the *worl'* is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we *got* to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
Glad to get shet of him. Never was no good an' never will be--
It sure is hell jus' tryin' to get enough to eat.
I'd a found you, Ma.
Don't taste bad.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know *is* crimes.
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You *got* to keep clear.
They killed Casy first.
They know what--this fella looks like?
Don't know--but it's better'n this.
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
Then what, Tom?
There, them stripy ones.
Muley! Where's my folks, Muley?
Are you crazy?
That's what I asked you, ain't it?
But it don't seem possible--kicked off like that!
Hide out for what? We ain't doin' nothin'.
Now don't go blaming me. It ain't *my* fault.
Sol' things, chopped cotton--even Grampa. Got us about two hunnerd dollars all tol'. Shucked out seventy- five for this truck, but we still got nearly a hunnerd and fifty to set out on. I figger we oughta be able to make it on that.
Awright, go on! Ain't nobody stoppin' ya!
Morning.
Shore looks like my lucky day, anyway. Gettin' some work at las'.
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
I'm Martin Blank.
Whatever I can get away with.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
A Jew, a shaman, and a herbalist are telling you the same thing? You're insane.
Insane.
Yes.
I'm a professional killer.
You see someone?
Bad experiences.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
We haven't seen each other since high school.
Yes.
No.
That's probably a good idea.
Come on.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Hello Martin. How have you been?
That sounds pretty interesting...
Yup.
All of it?
I'll do it tomorrow.
That's wonderful, Mom.
It's a place where religious people--
Same thing that happened to you-- I stopped poutin' there on the sidelines. Got in. Got on the team. I joined the working week, you slick fucking asshole, so why don't you valet park your high horse and take it easy on your old buddy, Paul.
You too.
Work's good for the soul.
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
All by yourself?
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Need a lift?
Feel good?
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Five years. My son was born here.
I won't ask you to.
Annie!
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
I brought it to you in the hospital.
Maybe they should put me down too.
Whatever you want.
I didn't know I had to.
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
Don't they believe in signs here?
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
You're right. Good.
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
Tom?
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
Well, now you know what it feels like.
What?... Oh baby...
Tom's gone.
So do you.
Good.
Hi.
I should be in by two.
Yeah. Bye.
We're very lucky.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
I love you.
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
Yeah.
No.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Okay.
You're allergic to hay.
Let's not talk about that now.
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
You want to take a walk with me?
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
She calls him Tommy...
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
I'd love to go there one time...
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Yes, it does.
Promise?
Yes, but he's in a tremendous pain...
Annie, no matter what I do, this horse will never be the same.
That's what some folks say.
And next time, Miss Annie, you can run down the calves...
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
Sure.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
No!
You want to go to a movie tonight?
I just could never say it!
I'm okay... I'm okay.
OK, OK.
Maybe... look -- just...
I want to see Pilgrim.
I know. Amazing.
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
YA JUST HAD A TURN. IT WAS NOT.
You ever miss it?
Honey... I was always good.
It's cool!
It looks good, sir. We've got an uncorrupted hard drive.
Alright sir.
...IF it weren't run by a bunch of profiteering gluttons!
Shh!
Check this out. It's a memo about how they're gonna deal with those oil spills that happened on the fourteenth.
Again?  Yeah sure.
Yo, man, you an amateur, man.
That's far out!
A worm AND a virus? The plot thickens.
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Go fix the phones.
That's it, you're looking at it, he just looks slick all day.
Right. If I win, you wear a dress on our date.
That's bullshit.
Burn!
It's cool, I'm just looking.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
You're not gonna win.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
This Ellingson security creep. I gave him a copy of the disc you gave me.
It's my subway defense system.
They didn't. The guys felt it was the only way I'd get a date. Anyway, you're pretty good. You're elite.
Yeah, well, you know these Japanese management techniques.  Could you, uh, read me the number on the modem?
No. He's either very smart or very stupid.
What's going on? Let go of me! Stewardess! I'll never fly this airline again!
What's happening?
One more "dude" out of you and I'm gonna slap the shit outa you, okay? Now I'm trying to save you from yourself but you gotta stop letting your mama dress you, man! : Check it...
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
Once again, don't call me Eugene.  A recent unknown intruder penetrated, using a superuser acount, giving him access to our whole system.
Virus?
Relax. Think about the 25 million dollars.
All right.
So I have to watch Jamie tonight.
No, you don't understand.
Get back!
No. You son of a bitch!
Loomis, it's over. Leave it alone.
It's okay..it's okay.
Sorry. Do you suppose Susan could just bring her crutches? Oh, stupid question. Tell her I hope  she feels better.  Susan's mother, she can't baby-sit tonight.
Susan broke her ankle last night at the ice rink  Rachel?
I told them to be here by nine. Its not 9:30 yet.
I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
Drive Carefully.
Got it Earl.
Your mother used to baby-sit me when I was your age.  I bet you didn't know that.
You bet.
No way! Halloween's great. Can we stay out all night?
Oh Rachel!
I've got you come on, go down.
Then we'll be safe?
All right.
Hi.
Don't you mean what you do best?
Jamie?
This is 132, over.
He's here, Sheriff.
Hank, call the troopers and check his story out.  And assuming what you say is true..
All right. Pierce, do it. Lets check on this little girl.
Yes.
Let it be Earl. Let the police handle it.
You haven't got a police force! These men may be the only defense you've got.
Batteries. I planned the generator for the house next week. I wished I hadn't waited.  This is squawk 79er zero of Haddonfield broadcasting on the state police emergency frequency. Can anyone hear me?
Car trouble?
What's going on?
What happened?
You blame everything on kids.
Huh?
Why did you hang up on me?
Bye.
He was watching me.
Annie!
No, he's not.
...Then you rip my clothes off. Then we rip LYNDSEY'S clothes off. I think I've got it.
Lee Brackett.
Could have...
He isn't a man.
If you do they'll be seeing him everywhere, on every street corner, in every house. Just tell your men to shut their mouths and open their eyes.
Nothing's going on. Just kids playing pranks, trick or treating, partying, getting high... I have the feeling you're way off on this...
I'll stay out with you tonight, Doctor, just on the chance that you're right. And if you are right, damn you for letting him out.
I found the car! He's here!
No. I thought she'd be home by now. She went to pick up Paul.
Sure.
Sure. Sure.
I don't like that story.
Why are they under there?
There was no one outside.
Tommy, let me in!
I'm scared...
It's the bogyman, isn't it?
Let's make more popcorn.
Hi, Lindsey, this is Paul. Is Annie there?
I notified everybody! Nobody listened.
You can get back on the telephone and tell them exactly what walked out of here last night. And tell them where he's going.
He was doing all right last night. Maybe somebody around here gave him lessons.
What did you use before?
He'll barely be able to sit up.
I think we should refer to 'it' as 'him.'
What does that mean?
Shouldn't we pick him up?
Mm-mm!
You want to see some?
A lot of works.
Uh --
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Oh, is that what it is?
Okay.
It depends on what way you want to go.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
Okay, Norman, listen, I really want to talk about this at home.  I think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
We're actresses.
I cry at the opera.
I'm an architect.
What time do you get off?
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Well...
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing.  Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
'Cause I got a lot of wall space there. 
What are you doing here?
Ohhhh!
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Well, sure.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
I have been in love with you for so long.
I, I must apologize.  I-I'm, I-I'm sorry.  I'm so mixed up.
What do you expect me to say?
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
I care a great deal about him, yes.
I know!  I know!
But, you got four children!
No!  But you keep asking these, these awful questions.  My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH  You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject.  What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less.  You sleep with me less and less.
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
Leave me alone, can you?!
You're not lost.
Yeah.
Always.
It's on the table, Dad.
Oh, honey!
How can we be happy?
But Catholicism?  Why not your own people?
Mom, come out!
Mmm...
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
Oh, Frederick!
I can't take this anymore.
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Hello?
Like what?!  What?
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
I can't stay on this show.  I gotta get some answers.  Otherwise  I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
Okay.
How are you?
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Oh, now-- 
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
Huh?
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
Wow!
Is there no chance?
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Fro--?  You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
...from Mavis, also.
Th-th-they, they wanted me for a screen test.
Yes, she's lovely, but she doesn't have your spark.  She knows it.  She worships you. She wouldn't dare get up there on the stage.
No, no, we decided!
Oh, sure.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
I should get a garter belt.
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Really?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it. 
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
You got it.
Yeah, that's clerical.
How?
Uh, losers!  All losers!
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
No!
Jesus...  I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people.  Really.
...in a really horrible way.
Well, I hope you've changed.
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Really?
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you.  I don't know why it would.
You've always hated my taste in the past.
You have.
What...what about your script?  So what's it about?
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
Fabulous, I mean it!  I'm so impressed.
It was just great.  Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script.  I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
Oh, yeah?  What?
Just a few minutes ago.
Hmm.
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
...you don't have to think.
I'm going to tell you later....
...what <u>hindered</u> you...?
Or, perhaps...
Orderly.
I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions.
And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase.
Waal, because your <u>selling</u>'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz.  P.A.N.Z.  Sounds to me like an Orderly.  Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand?
Now, whyn't you help us?
Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income.
Say it in English.
<u>That's</u> the spirit...
You want me to be?
...they did it for a lark.
I'm not.
...the whole world's out to get you...
You take this much time over everything?
Somewhere in Italy.
You said the <u>bad</u> news...
I believe that your tone implied that there was some <u>good</u> news.... and, do you know... there might be good news for <u>you</u>...
Starling, I've ordered you to shut...
You seen John Brigham...?
Well, then--I wouldn't want to be taken for a <u>hobbyist</u>...
He requests your presence, once again, as part of...
And how did she get close enough to disarm you?
You nervous...?
'bout time you <u>learned</u>...
Well, you know <u>my</u> name, honey, but <i>I</i> don't know <u>yours</u>...
Hey, you know, I never thought of that...
And how do we account for the interest of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?
Could you tell me:  did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...?
I'll have them picked up.
Enchante.
Indeed I am.  And the connection, between Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears... if you'd come with me, I could show you...
If such there breathe, I'm sure you could <u>unearth</u> him...  Your reputation does you honor. 
...yes, yes, yes...
No. 
...and Shirly, let me sleep with her sometime.
Sir, I'm in Law Enforcement, I was out there, dealing with an armed and dangerous...
THEN WHERE WAS IT?  I'm sent out there... I'm told that the <u>arrest</u> must be a joint...
Due respect, you <u>don't</u>, sir, your precious Joint Operation.  FBI, ATF, DC SWAT, it's alphabet <u>soup</u>, we don't have the same Radio Freqs, we don't...
I'm opposed to being part, Your Rainbow Coalition.  Evelda Drumgo?  I could of took her down in a snap of the <u>fingers</u>-- <u>But</u>-- I'm out there, and my Rules of Engagement...
Sir, I was, as instructed, waiting for the Arrival of the Strike Force. {PAUSE)
Spoken like a Protestant.
...we were speaking of my <u>father</u>...
Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.  The Greatest crime.  Perhaps the <u>only</u> crime.  <u>I</u> never ceased to hope!
No, that is code-word material, that's what <u>that</u> is....
...not to turn around.
You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your <u>mind</u> cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step <u>slow</u>...
You got a lot of people love you, Starling.
Speaking of which, I want you also to get us tickets for the Opera...
Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, <u>if</u> you get it, will not buy me a new <u>watch</u>... 
Oh, my <u>program</u>...
...what did you want? 
I'm sure I don't know who you mean.
What shape is the scar?
No, y'know, I never <u>doubted</u> it...
I'm sure there is, but my young Friend here, would <u>kill</u> you. 
....this is perhaps an inappropriate <u>time</u>... but, I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who <u>solved</u> the celebrated Hannibal Lechter...
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you can't understand.
...no...
No, I don't <u>think</u> so...
How do you think that made him feel?  What does that <u>mean</u>, "to go beyond the institution...?" 
Yes.
Yes.
No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible?
And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?
About three days. I'm a monster. He's a monster. Actually, we're both just guys. I don't expect you to understand that I...
Don't raise your voice at--I gave you the ultimate male fantasy--sex, nothing on the side. Don't pretend we shared anything other than fluids.
That's it, Adam, pretend it's one of those arcade things, the tighter you squeeze, the more of a man you are...Ooh, that's it.
Andrew. You're not gay; you're ten. You shouldn't even be having thoughts like...
Was there a night that I got really drunk and declared that I never loved anyone as much as I loved you?
That's good. I wouldn't have wanted to embarrass myself.
Call me conservative, but I'd rub my penis on the faces of all the ladies before bestowing the final honors to the divine Ms. Berry's lovely visage.
I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
Oh thanks, it was nothing...
Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
Hey, I thought I wasn't your type.
Get him alone for the summer. Out in the wilderness. Underneath the stars...
Hey--whaddya say, we need another muskrat to join our Sunshine circle. Scurry up!  Isn't Fun great!
Yes you do.
Talia's a rock. She'll be fine...
Don't be. Don't be sorry for your thoughts. They make me...react. I don't know...all I know is that I can't go through another summer where I <u>almost</u> did something.
And you'll be happy to know I'm going to drop my Snow White and the Seventy Dwarves act...Not all of it, but...
Don't worry, you...
What do you want me to say?
Thank you, my love.                                         ]
What are you doing, Wendy?  What's in that cup?
Hey really, I don't feel so great.
Like last night, Veronica?
Shut up, it is. I told Dennis if he gave me another topic that was political, I'd spew burrito chunks.
I'm sorry, it's just why can't we talk to different kinds of people?
Like I give a shit. They all want me, as a friend or a fuck. I'm worshipped at Westerburg and I'm only a Junior.
Whatever. I don't believe this. We're going to a party at Remington University tonight and we're brushing up our conversation skills with the scum of the school.
We made a girl want to consider suicide. What a scream. What a jest.
You goddamn bitch!
Lick it up, baby. Lick. It. Up.
King David.
I'm giving Veronica her shot. Her first Remington Party. Blow it tonight girl and it's keggers with kids all next year.
Oh, I just had the <u>nicest</u> chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots?
Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but...
Some teenybopper rag says Big Fun wants to play a Prom. It could be Westerburg's if we can get everyone's John Hancock.
Is she dead?
Because I can be! The same fucking cheek, goddamnit! Why are you pulling my dick? Do you think, do you really think, if Betty Finn's fairy godmother made <u>her</u> Cool, she'd still act nice and hang with her dweebette friends? No way! Uh-Uh!
Oh sure, Pilgrims, Indians, tater tots; it's a real party continent.
Give me the clipboard.
Yeah, where's your urge to purge?
Uh-huh.
Mourning. Maybe watch some T.V. Why?
Maybe it's time for a vacation.
S'okay....
Man Veronica, pull the plug on that shit. I say we go with Big Blue.
Stop kidding around. I'm going to have to send my S.A.T. scores to San Quentin instead of Stanford.
Yeah. Scary stuff.
My Mom's making my favorite meal tonight. Spaghetti. Lots of oregano.
French.
Oh, you're so smart. How about a little heterosexuality before we go?
Of course.
How do you think Mr. Kelly would react to a son with a limp wrist with a pulse?
She wants to ignore the high school experience. Our way's better. We scare people into not being assholes.
Our relationship's moving fast, I know, but I have real, real respect for you.
Wait a....You're not listening! I'm not on your side....
You don't get it, do you? Society nods its head at any horror the American teenager can think to bring upon itself. We don't need gloves and does anyone really care about exact handwriting?
What?
I thought I...you..
Hey Ram, doesn't this cafeteria have a No Fags Allowed Rule?
Shut the fuck up, all right.
Great pate, but I'm going to have to motor if I want to be ready for the party tonight.
This condescending junk makes suicide seem like a cool thing to do. Hey kids, make your parents and teachers feel like shit! Get the respect in death you'll never get in life.
That's three things.
Oh, I was scared of the same thing, Heather. The minute you try to deal with the actual teenagers who have contemplated suicide you're stepping into quicksand. Quicksand filled with bad complexions, bad grades, bad parents, bad drugs, and all sorts of doody nobody wants to hear let alone bend down to clean up.
playfully shoves his hand away.
Come on through.
breaks down into heavy sobs.
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
gives her a sympathetic look.
Mummy!
Somebody's got to help us!
He . . .
Him . . .
You're such an incredible woman.
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
That was what we were led to believe . . .
I need my sodding parents' consent.
You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor.
Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity.
Second most common?
Eighty third most common.
Did I ever talk about Kirsty?
Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut.
Really? Do tell.
I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. 
Allison Dormere. Your intern.
What's the difference?
Zero's a number right?
What?
In a word? Lucrative.
Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second.
What?
It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
I did read that, yes.  What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General.
That's right Trevor. The timing was impeccable wasn't it? It's been eight months two weeks and three days but we finally found the body. Just need you to ID it for us.
A little? Try unbelievably.
Pardon my glibness Trevor but you sound like a raving lunatic. The next time you seek counsel it should be of the psychiatric type. You're obviously on the verge of some nervous collapse.
I don't work here.
Wow you are out of it.  
Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
YOU!
I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually.
I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other?
They interview you or anything? At the plane crash?
LaPlante!
Jail!  Listen, Bubber...  This is crazy.  We could fall off of here.
Right.
It was you!  I thought I heard...
Y-you're a g-god damn saint, John.
I understand.  How often do you see your son?
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
You mean John Bubber?
Nine.  I think.  Maybe ten.  Yeah, ten.  Nice kid.
When I was a kid, I thought I was gonna be this fantastic wonderful heroic human being.
You don't wanna know, Chick, you don't wanna know.  Those guys been in here?
DON'T SAY "BILL," BERNIE!  DON'T SAY ONE WORD!  DIDN'T I SAY "ONE WORD AND YOU'RE FIRED?"
I DON'T CARE ABOUT <u>YOUR</u> PROBLEMS, I'M GONNA THINK ABOUT <u>MY</u> PROBLEMS. <u>YOU'RE</u> ONE A MY PROBLEMS.  GET OUT! OUT!  OUT!
You are not gonna believe this, Evelyn!  Absolutely fantastic!  I'm on my way --
Maybe not,... but you let him believe it!  And then I gotta explain about the homeless...
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do?  What are you -- ?
Yes, everybody <u>is</u> in love with John Bubber.  The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet...  blackmailing a national hero...
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness.  He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car.  It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
Who am I?  You're asking me?  You're the big expert for Chrissake!  I'm what?  The "Scumbag," right?  The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
What picture?
I'm working on that.  It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
It's been sometime since, uh, I received any, uh, of that kind of, uh... attention.  A couple of... years.
Gale... you're a very nice person. I wouldn't want to hurt you... in any way...
A script!  I thought we just walked through everything...
It's no big deal, it just <u>looks</u> better carrying me.  Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
No, John, you're too hard on yourself.  I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
This sofa is a lethal weapon.  The springs... are... the springs... what...?
Unprofessional.
Relax, Wally.  He had the shoe and the shoe checks out.
She's talking to him now.
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Don't be ridiculous.  I'm a reporter.
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
How are they with kids?
Okay.
Whoa, check it out.
A lot of my stuff hasn't been unpacked yet.  Here's the TV.
Right.
Yeah, since I was a kid.  I had a woodwork class once when I was... in school that time.  Then I learned a lot more when I was in the --
Listen, no one ever said expressing yourself to the opposite sex is easy, but when the time comes, you have to do it and you <u>hope</u> the outcome will be good for both of you. You come out of solitary and you rejoin the human race, as difficult as that sometimes can be.
I am.  I'm really feeling pretty good.  I have a much stronger sense of how far I've come.
Well, we talked about the whole disapproval thing.
No, no, no, no.
Well, now, don't go creating some artificial environment for yourself.
Maybe I could take a look at it now.
Just show me the way.
-- General handyman, yeah.  I do carpentry, too, painting, almost any odd job around the house.  I do housesitting while the owners are away.  In fact, that's why I've been in the area.  I've been living very close by.  Here's the part that's giving you trouble, but I won't be able to get a replacement till the stores open tomorrow morning.
Uh, no -- I've never really found the time to settle down.
Yeah, I've always been able to make my way in the world.  I don't like having to rely on other people.
Uh huh.
"Find a penny, pick it up, all day long you'll have good luck!"
Did Daddy tease you?
Holly -- that's not so.
Well, what do you want me to do, Rita -- I can't just forget fifteen years of marriage.  Well, of course I know <u>you</u> can.  No, Rita, I -- what was that?  -- oh, I thought I heard something on the line.
Yeah.  There's still a lot I want to do.  It's not quite... the kids aren't really settled in yet. Even the dog has been terribly high-strung and whines a lot since we've been here.  Look, he hasn't even come in for his food today.
I've asked him what's wrong.
"We don't want to be late for our first day of school."
Because you'd have to get up at five a.m., would you like that?
I think we got it just in time before the ink dried.
The pocket's a cinch -- I'll sew it up for you after dinner, okay?
Mom, I heard someone downstairs!
Stop knowing me so well.
High end?  Honey, it's a whole new budget.
It's very nice, but it's still a little pricey for us.
One day before we know it it'll be an old house and we'll be old in it -- and I'll still be paying for it.
Oh, honey.
There might be some extras in the garage.
Yeah -- we know him.  He's been hanging around the house.
Sometimes they prefer a quicker return on their investment.
Grow up, Dreyer.
Do you have enough money?
No.
Rudolf?  C'mere, Rudolf!
And I can't help having a cold.
Neil, goddamn it, you're not five years old!
No.
Really.
Talk to me about what?
They appear to be authentic.
It's not a homicide, Lieutenant.
I think it was England.
So?
No.
That is what bothers me.
And what do you think you will find in another land?
I've learned that a man can only go so along living alone.
Where I'm going you cannot follow.
Any idea how big the cavern is on the other side?
He was wearing a bullet proof vest.
You got me.
Are you the type of person who takes advice, Miss Hillman?
Jennifer.
I've lived all over the world.
Why?  Because I don't give up all my secrets?
I wanted to get to know you better.
A little -- yes.  My interest in coming here is profession.
Where is the film crew from the British Museum?
I don't think it is a duplication.
I was working on the cataloging.
We'll see.
This cannot be.
I'll no forget you.
Fine.
It's me, Chief.  Can you talk?
It was stolen.
Don't go Rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine.  I'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.
You won't die if you let me help.
Mars?!  Whattaya think, dude?  Out here on the edge, no one around, it's perfect, right?
That's why we tied him, dumbass.  Now come here and see this --
That's crazy.  He's not going to kill us.
I'm not going to die for this!
The Bristo Police Department.  Look out the window.  You see the car?
How about your two friends?  You don't have a man dying in there, do you?
You don't have to explain shit!  That Chinaman pulled a gun.  We wrestled for it.  That Chinaman shot himself.
Would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?
Hey, I've got a situation here, in case you haven't noticed.
I like it here, Dennis.  I'm never going to leave.
Give me an ETA.
What hospital?
My wife and my daughter and the money. I'll bring the disks to the mall by the freeway, you bring my family.  We'll trade.
You said they would be here!
We'll see you in a couple of hours.
But they're not here yet.  Tell me about <u>you</u>.
You sure?
You go, Thomas.  You get out, and I'll stay with Daddy.
We can't make the microwave work.
I don't know what you're talking about.
What are you doing?!  Stop that!
Three white males shot Junior.  Mike followed them to York Estates --
York Estates.  Four-five-five Castle Way. Anders and Jorgenson are on the way.
Other people can hear us.  Just call. <u>Please</u>.
If we have a man dying in there, we'll have to go in.
Don't question me, Captain!  This is <u>my</u> crime scene!
Mike found a red pickup abandoned on Flanders.  You see it?
Are all of you named Jones?
What?
Where's the office?
I opened Marlon.  I think it's somebody's taxes.
How do I reach him?
You can let go.
We want them.  You will not let anyone go into that house--or anything come out-- until my people recover these disks.
These disks . . . where are they?
I guess we do.
They're killing everyone. The Lady Minister! The UN soldiers. They're at the gate.
And four children?
I swear, Captain, one hundred thousand francs, enough for a house. I will get the money, you keep them outside.
Unfortunately we're here as peace-keepers not peace makers, we can't take an aggressive role.
Yes we have.
We think you are dirt, less than dirt, worthless.
Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're the smartest man here. You have them all eating out of your hand. You'd own this fucking hotel, except for one thing.
Give me their uniforms. I will put people at the gate, in disguise.
It's a single malt, Glenmorangie. I thought you'd like it. Anything you need, gentlemen, let me know.
Watch everything? How? They are gone.
Satellites?
The front gate would be best, General.
You said you had no whiskey.
No. We have no way of finding other stock but I have money for you from the guests.
No.
No, sir.
Listen, you need me.
You think they will believe you?
At least.
I need rice, beans, beer, and your best whiskey.
Take the river road back. It is clear.
Great.  No kidding, When will they be here? Excellent. Yes, call then.
What is it?
Go! What the fuck sort of journalists are we, running from a war? I'm ashamed. Are you? Well, are ya'?
I don't have to listen to you anymore.
Please, except my humblest apologies...
I would never do that.
I...ah...need some time. Please give us twenty, thirty minutes. People are sleeping.
That will take time.
Call, sir?
We are to meet Mr. Rutagunda.
He will be here.
One thousand francs.
They have him in the lobby, go quickly.
How do you know?
I will give you my house.
They will surely kill us here. It's over here. We have to take the chance.
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Connections? I have no connections, only favors. If I call to help Victor, a General will think "Paul Rusesabagina is a fool. He thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." Then my hard work is doubly squandered. I insult the General and I do not get to use my favor at all. Please leave these things to my good judgment.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
No, Odette says he's in shock.
No. They are not dead. Stop this.
It's alright. This is the only place I can find some peace.
We have to get out of here Tatiana.
I'll try but we have to leave, with or without them. I want you to promise.
Get on the truck, Tatiana.
What's wrong?
Sir, no one wants to work. They say the boss has left.
Thank you, sir.
Go downstairs, I will help you.
If that's the fact, Price, okay, you've had your fun -- now open the goddamn --
I'm confused.
-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
-- the whole thing is falling apart!
But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
Not at all!
-- uh, excuse me, just one quick question? How long before this damn thing unseals itself?
No. I'm going back to try and find Ms. Marr. If she's hurt, I'll tend to her. Dead, then I'm coming back for him.
Ms. Marr!
Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.
As a tumor.
I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
Nothing.
Did it work?
What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
It's not going to let us out!
Up here --
Over here!
Take the gun.
Best of a nightmare.
I thought she was dead. For sure.
Most of my business is making deliveries to high rollers. And I have yet to meet one Executive who could tie their own shoes -- let alone rewire an entire house. You don't fit the bill -- not even close.
No -- keep pulling, it's moving!
-- that's the fact, bud --
Let's try down here...
He's gotta still be down here.
He's dead...?
For chrissake give me a hand!
Jesus!
Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
How'd you make your guest list, Price: throw darts at a phone book?
Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn?
-- I pose you the same question --
-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
What?
Are you still fucking <b>here</b>??
Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing.
-- my loss --
What?
Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
Something with the power, I don't know!!
Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
Well, I can't, sweetheart.
Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
Maybe it was just its time to finally fall apart.
-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
Accumulated evil... festering for decades...  But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
He must've unsealed the room!
What was her name?
What will they tell you?
I'm sorry.
Pearl, is the twilight, the divinity... Onyx is the sickle, death...
Maybe it was Colleen...
Ok...
Go to your room!  Now!
He's blessing the house.
Ok ok...we're just gonna head inside here...
Yeah I'll look into that tonight.
Whatever you say.
To our family.
Did anyone in your family keep in touch with her?
I don't know.  That's strange.
I don't know.  Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
Voodoo stick?  It's nothing like that Will.  You're just being cynical.
I'm sure this sounds crazy to you.
Know what?
I'm ok.
I'm all right...
We usually find nothing.  We've debunked many a reported haunting. About ninety five percent of the cases had some technical explanation.
You'll have to settle for turkey.
Yes, I am.
Aubrey?  It's mommy.
Well, I believe her mind was playing tricks on her, God rest her soul.  She would hear things, see things...
We'll be there.
It was nailed to the cellar wall.
Not at all, if it can help.
Jesus Christ ...
Joey ....  Look, you wanna ride?  I can go by your place.
You have to help me.  You will understand.  And no, you're not dreaming.  Do you know where we are?
Captain Spenser.  Elliott.  I ... What the Hell is going on?
And why are you back?  Why are we here?
The Box, Joey.  He wants the Box.
Where?
Right.
Guys.  Sometimes friends.  Mostly guys.
No.  I buy them to impress people.  Of course I've read them.
Maybe not.  But you know more than I do. You know something about this box. Something about a statue?
Would you know this store again?
No.  We want ...
On the contrary.  It has everything to do with the world.  And our dreams of how it will succumb to us.  You enjoyed the girl?
Live and in the flesh.  How're you doing, babe?
I know.  I know.  It's bad.  I'm a bad person.  But I try not to be, Terri.  I really do.  And I really miss you.
Yeah, a girl I know helped smarten it up.  Put her heart and soul into it.
Yes!  God, yes.  I ... I just want to hug you.  To hold you.  To tell you it's alright.
Still do the puzzles, still know the running times of songs, and I'll bet you're still the best damn cat burg--
Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do?  Statue of Liberty?  Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix?  Seduce some women?  Play Nintendo?  Bone some chicks?
Sure.  That's why his meatballs are made out of marinated Chuck Wagon.
Hey, you promised......Don't worry, I'm wearing my girdle.
But I said I was sorry....
I can't believe you didn't notice. My weight.  I lost ten pounds in Rome
It's Boston, Mr. Mayflower.
Ooh-kay...
Close call, but she's our only way of keeping tabs on that damn mysterious Vatican organization. Hawk, it's time to go to the principal's office....
As for our plan of action, anybody'd be insane to go in from the ground floor...
Yeah.  The big E.
Fantastic.  Perfection.  The Vatican extends its jealousy to the lucky bidder.
Does everyone in the world know more than me?  Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half.  Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!
Uh, yeah.  Guess I'm a wee bit nervous.  I'm sorry I could only score clergy passports.
When the Mayflowers find out we have the Codex, they're going to want to make a deal...
That's two hundred dollars a day? So he can get a hooker and some tequila.  Veto, Darwin.
Like a "cat", one could say.
Market crashes.  Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects.  We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world.  In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower.  It's one party we'd love to poop.
We're here to say, your government was right.
You could host American Bandstand in here.  Why did you duck at the auction, asshole?
You want an address on that last one?
How was I supposed to know they were women?  Besides one of them was bald and kept saying "Soitinly."
Yes.
For God's sake, chain this convict.
Just browsing.  Don't touch me....
It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns.  Markets will crash- crash.  Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
You can't, convict!  You're just a shmoe!  Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them.  It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?"  It's a natural inclination.  But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is <u>reality</u>! You are on my planet!  You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist!  The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
Bastard!  If you were a true American.
Three minutes, twenty-three seconds.  If you think I'm doing another...
I'm supposed to fall for that?
They may be scum, but if I get the Da Vinci model back, then we'll be roasting weenies on the beach.
Sharp.
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
But then I figured it out: they did it 'cause they figured young Norville for an imbecile. Like some othuh people ah know.
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
I'm happy enough.
He didn't offer you money.
Ten dollars? Let's grab a highball!
You've lost it, Aim. You've gone soft by the looks of it -- soft on the dummy from Dubuque --
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
Oh, no, really, I --
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
You know, on farm route 17.
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Now, Aim --
Now, Aim --
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Phony, huh?
Whatever. That's what sells newspapers.
He grins wolfishly.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
But, buddy, you were --
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
Nah, that's all forgotten.
Norville.
Ah, it's New Year's, I'm not gonna add to your woes. I'm just saying.
Well, why don't ya read it.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Barnes! Where the hell have you been! And where's my voucher?!
Well, I'm a college graduate --
Oh my God, sir!
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
No, Bennie: Lumbago.
He don't look wise.
Thank you for waking me.
I know, miss.  But I like to do it. I like to tend for Miss Jessica and I want to tend for you.  You settle right back, now, and I'll mix you your coffee.
Ti-Misery?  What's that?
But they came to a beautiful place, didn't they?
Use your influence with Paul.  Ask him to take that whiskey decanter off the dinner table.
That's sweet of you, Mrs. Rand.
I don't know.  I prefer to think of her as a sleepwalker who can never be awakened -- feeling nothing, knowing nothing.
I've never heard of a cure.
Thank you.
I would have stayed anyway, Dr. Maxwell.
Very well.  That means that you have met all Mr. Holland's requirements.  Now, as to salary -- it's quite good -- two hundred dollars a month.
A year's contract -- a trip with all expenses paid -- that's not so bad, you know.
That's rather nice, isn't it?
Thank you.  But who sits there? 
Higher mathematics.  Two ounces to a drink -- three drinks, six ounces.
I'm a nurse.  I always watch people when they pour something.  I watched Ti-Joseph and it was exactly two ounces.
Of course, Wes.
You read my thoughts, Mr. Holland.
Yes, thank you.
Yes.  But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship.  That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
If I were as timid as you seem to think, Mr. Holland, I wouldn't have gone into the tower in the first place.
Nothing -- really.  But you must admit it's an eerie sort of place -- so dark --
Mrs. Holland must have been beautiful ---
Yes, he can.  But I've been wondering -- you know if you could leave the whisky decanter off the table --
I love Fort Holland.
Because you wanted to give my wife back to me?  Why should that mean anything to you?
But I had no thought of harming her.  It wasn't I...
It is a hard decision to make -- but yours is only a technical responsibility...
Paul, we're not trying to blame Miss Connell.  It isn't a question of blame.  It's a question of what we are to do with Jessica.  The commissioner is very concerned.
In view of all the circumstances, the commissioner has decided on a legal investigation.
Got a meeting uptown.
Clair, George Clair! What the hell brings you to New Canaan?
And as usual no one believed me...
That shrink -- the one you always wanted me to see? I thought you dropped him.
You want to go?
Well, it is a neighborhood tradition.
Hmm. Good night.
You know Elena, I've been thinking--
What else could I be? What else could I be? We're not living in the real world here. You're living out some fantasy land from the past, or some advice or something from those psychoanalysts... there are some hard facts here.
Sure I do. Do I know what loneliness feels like? Sure I do. I know a lot about it, if that's what you mean.
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
Sure. I'll try. And we'll talk in the morning?
Well good. Just confirming. You'll be on the 3:50 Wednesday afternoon.
Fine.
Birth control.
Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it.
Nothing.
Jesus all right enough!
Huh?
And why are you still calling me dad? You're forty years old already, and --
That's besides the point.
Advice? I'm supposed to be getting the stock tips from you, Ben. Unless - have you quit your job? They fired you?
-- Your mother, God bless her, stood by me for forty-two years -- we never once contemplated divorce - I assume you're talking here about divorce? The very thought --
-- Waiter! Where's my cobb salad?  You want advice Ben? If your big brother were still alive I'd have him go out into the back yard and beat some sense into your head. Look kid, you married that woman against my advice --
Ben, I'm going to Florida. I hate Thanksgiving and I hate the cold. I have a new nurse. She's a negro, she weighs three hundred pounds, and I've decided to leave my entire estate to her.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Let me.
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Well, we can talk about it.
Hi Wendy.
We were just riding around.
It's really quite all right.
Social work?
You don't have to apologize. I'm too much of a cynic. You actually seem to be trying to figure things out -- don't mind me.
They say you never forget.
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about.  Take care.
Perhaps you might find it in your heart to call me Philip?
Sometimes the shepherd needs the company of the sheep.
See ya.
Um, Libbets Casey.
My man, I speak to you solely as a comrade in arms offering unconditional aid. I've been giving this one a lot of thought, and I believe that the two of you together might just reach that higher ground that --
Hell, I guess he takes after me, huh?
You know, it's the whip -- the one uncle Frank got me from Mexico.
Sure I do, you know, like your aura. That you give off.
I don't have a girlfriend.
Out.
Tell Sandy? What?
Wendy!
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
Charles, what time is it?
Shit. I can't really talk about it. I guess I better get to the train.
The ones you built?
Vodka?
Huh?
That's nice. Are you drunk?
Got a love affair with police work. Drives me crazy with it.
About how long 'til you heard the suspect's second shot?
I had him!
Okay.
About an hour ago.  Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
Why?
Don't worry.  I'll have a cool scar.
We just gotta catch the bastard, right?
What I saw?
Has her books in it.
What?
Mrs. Connell found this copy in the house.  It's signed.  Personally.
Dammit, Will.  Warfield had me locked up in his office again for five hours yesterday.  <i>Five</i> hours.  Asking all kinds of questions...
But he's zeroing in on <i>me</i>.  On <i>us</i>. Everyone's talking about it.
Goddammit, Hap.  Think about what you're doing...
Huh?
She loved me.  She wanted to see me every night.
Friday night, at the party - what'd you fight about?
The other guy?
That's a long time.
Who?
Who?
What was it?
Yes.
I didn't want to kill her, Will.
Yes, and very beautiful.
Are you the leader of tis group?
Nothing if not vampires...
You said there were none.
Yes you are, my dearest. You are mine and Louis' daughter. You see Louis was going to leave us. He was going to go away. But now he's not. He's going to stay and make you happy.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
Stop her Louis!
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
No. Laudanum.
What have you done?
Hush, Claudia don't talk about such things. Show me your book.
And he found me with you. I ran, sickened at what I'd done. Then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. I tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. And have been every night hereafter.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
No. She's frightened. She doesn't know where she is.
Be still!
What danger?
That's not so.
Yes...
And a beautiful house it is too. Yours is a good life, isn't it?
I've come to answer your prayers. You want to die, don't you? Life has no meaning anymore, does it?
They are gone, Louis. Death took them. Death which you can now destroy...
Give it to me!!!
You're the devil, aren't you? That's who you are.
I can't go through with it, I tell you.
Dying?
You've killed Louis. And enjoyed it.
And if I don't?
We can live like this? Off the blood of animals?
I don't know any hell -
Come the New Orleans then. There's an opera on tonight. A real french opera! We can dine in splendour!
What you wouldn't do. It's almost sunrise. It will be the sun or the fire. You said they can kill me. The sun or the fire!
Where do you think, my idiot friend? We're in a nice filthy cemetery. Does this make you happy? Is this fitting and proper enough?
I like to do it. I enjoy it. Take you aesthete's taste to purer things. Kill them swiftly if you will, but do it! For now doubt, you are a killer Louis. Ah!
Oh God Lestat. I felt peace. I felt an end to the craving.
What are you saying?
Lestat, what do you mean?
Don't try to speak... it's alright...
I tried...
Yes but you needn't worry about that now. Things change.
You're not lying to me, are you?
The same. As you would say today... Bull shit.
Can a vampire feel love?
I was human then. Might as well ask can an angel feel love. Both are blesses or cursed with a certain... detachment. Though whether angels take as long to learn it as I, I will never know.
Where would she have gone? She was a child, and beautiful, heartbreaking merciless child. And I had made her that...
He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
Au contraire, monsieur, I have.
What do you think she is, Madeleine? A doll?
July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork.
Listen to me, Julie. Ray's a great guy, nothing against old Ray, but he's so...Ray. I mean, he lives in Southport. Will's a nice guy, too, and he lives right down the street.
No.
Tyrell, I appreciate it, but have you seen my people dance? We make the mouth face, we move the fingers --
Julie, people who end up making rules like that end up beating their kids with wire hangers. It's a fact.
I think we can classify this as an emergency situation.
Rio isn't the capital of Brazil. It was the wrong answer. Sorry, we lose.
Can't what?
This weekend?
Hey -- I didn't know you were here. It's okay.  We got the refrigerator in. Come see.
Fine. Show me the body.
Wait, it's Nancy --
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
He's in it with Willis?
Me, me, me. It's always about you. I'm having bad dreams. I can't sleep. I'm not doing well in school. I'm having trouble with my boyfriend.
We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves.
Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical!
Why?
I'd hate for you to have to blow...your whistle.
How's Julie?
Well, Karla, what're you doin' at home over the long fourth weekend?
No. I shot him.
And so could you -- crazy fool.
Must have missed the sign.
Planter's Punch, Singapore Sling, or how about a Mai-Tai?
So why are you still here?
How's the water?
You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression --
And do what with it?
Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first.
You collect these to sell, abroad?
He won't even know you're there. He is delirious.
I must meet him with laughter - with songs and laughter -- to show him I am not afraid --
All the graves?
I donut understand.
No.  She shall not be left here.
I think she went to bed —— I saw her going toward the house
Poor Cathy --
I don't know now without my father.
She has never mentioned her family.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
That your father and I ——
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
I wanted to be sure of something, General -- something that has always preyed on my mind. I have a horror of being buried alive and awakening to find myself shut in —- entombed —— imprisoned..
I don't understand you.
If you should fall sick we'll be careful. You need not worry.
Never fear -- when you are dead you will remain dead. I will see to it that you do not walk about again. I promise you that. There is another one here who can not die. I will watch you both. Never fear.
Nothing, really. She's been under a great strain -- the journey -- the battle --
This girl -- Thea —- is not a servant in my household, sir. She is my daughter's companion. Now, sir, if you'll excuse me, I'll go have a look at Mr. Jacks.
We still don't know that it's the plague ——
Listen to what I say --
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
How would you like to get a ticket next week? Haven't you any romance in you?
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Carter –– bank examiner.
Suicide.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
Our clothes are dry.
Made what?
Yes, George?
Sit down? What are . . .
That's your problem, George Bailey.
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star –– made second team All American.
Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest gift.
What's that book you've got there?
The Building and what?
I know. I know.
You can keep him on. That's all right. As secretary you can hire anyone you like.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Looks like she can keep Harry on his toes.
Nice girl, Mary.
Can you give me one good reason why you shouldn't call on Mary?
Uh-huh.
Aw, forget it.
Where's my insurance policy?  Oh, here . . .
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
He's pretty young for that job.
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
Hello, Violet.
Yeah –– yeah . . . sure I will.
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
George . . .
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side very frankly. Now, let's look at your side. Young man, twenty-seven, twenty-eight . . . married, making, say . . . forty a week.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
I'd like to do that.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
Five hundred dollars.
In that place?
Come on, tell me.
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
Would you rather leave?
Thank you.
That does it –– come here.
Thanks for dropping around.
Left them at the office.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Going up to see Zuzu.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
What plates?
Oh, shucks . . .
You going to the lighthouse?
Well, I don't know....
What the hell.  For you....
How fast is enough?
What'd you do?  Memorize the tide tables?
Sean!  Listen!  Listen to me, Sean.
Stop paddling!
Back down!
Good.  It's terrible.
Shit.  Shit, shit, shit!
Like hell!  We're on the starboard tack!
Gangway, Turkies!
You bet.  Hang on....
Can you get us a line?
If there is, develop it!
Shit -- I'm late for dinner... Close up, okay?
About an hour, maybe two.  Let's see -- I came on about eight....
But I signed for the boat.  You' re not authorized any more.
Got it.
You could work out at the beach, make a few bucks for school.
You stay right here.  You're going in with me.
Not till next year.
Sean's still out there.
You said something about a camera.
Too late, it's written.
Come on, let's check the bite radius.
Bite radius.  You know, the size of the mouth?
Look, I know a little bit about sharks.
And how.  I thought you wouldn't respect me.
What're you guys doing today?
Oh, perfect -- a 75 per cent family affair.  Where were you?
Terrific.
Are you going to be able to sleep?
That's great.
Then that's what I meant.  Fired. Canned.  Out on my fanny.  The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police.  Just like that.
Don't rush into it -- we may need the income.
I got a feeling.  I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
Bullshit?  I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
What the hell does it take to make sense to you numbskulls?  Jesus, it's right there in front of you. I know what a goddamn shark looks like, I've been through it, don't you understand?  I've seen this sonofabitch before!
What for?
That's it?
Affirmative, affirmative.  Turn the Kids day-sailing back to port.  I heard you.  Patrol out.
Shouldn't he be at home?
Hiya yourself.
Shh.  Shhh....
It's all right, we're okay.
Seventeen.  She's a senior.
Nope.
You're crazy.  She's Ed's girl friend.
That's a crock of shit.
Double nope!
Wait a minute.  Promise me something.
Figure they split?
Name it.
I love it.
Maybe.
How the hell do we get him down. from there?
I can get it.
No, it will be too much distraction.  I don't want that many people in the water.  I'll go in, give it a belly shot, and get out.
Can't help you, Mike.  Don't have the manpower.
It's easy.  Put a net on the derrick.  Put the net in the water by the intake passage. Turn off the intake passage. Shark comes out into the net and is hauled up.
Coming with us?  Overman's buying.
What is it, 97 days?
They're acting very strange suddenly.
Honey, I gotta go.
Hi, baby.
That's a lot of ground to cover.
Let's not talk about that now, okay?
That we swim.
It's never over...  Here comes another six years of bad dreams.
Yes.
I know I can capture it.
I got it on sale.  A real steel.
How's your patient?
I don't want to see them, Kathryn.
So tell Calvin.
Hydrophobia...
I can't take water, Kathryn.
That's why they're always moving. They have to have it.
You two go!  I'll call Calvin!
Couple of fractures, lacerations. They say he's gonna be all right.
... Okay.
Who's going to do it?
Well then, can you have them jump to the camera over here?
I think we can capture it.  I'd like to try.
So do I, love.
I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
Skillful?  I missed my first shot.
Somebody could have gotten hurt.
Before, you were ready to feed this shark a hand grenade.  Now you're helping to nurse it back to life.
The water ski show!  We have to get them out!
She, Mister Hutton.
The net would have to be secured by the intake passage.
And big for his age.
Sure.  No problem.
And alone.
The one that goes underwater?
No, Kelly, I don't want to...
Can hardly wait to do it again.
What, hon?
Don't you dare.
That?
Calvin said it was all right.
Precisely.
So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
What the hell's there?
Polar bears in Georgia???
No way.
Always do.
I know.  But we show it's not closing.
So was Dad.
Don't hurry back.
It's not that easy.  Worked construction every summer to get through school.  Three years apprentice in the park's engineering department, and two years to build all this.  Finish school first, Sean.  Then make up your mind.  If you still want to work with me, we'll have plenty of time.
It's all up to Kathryn.  Amity's fine with me if it's fine with her.
Puppy love.  This time it's real! We can have a double wedding.
That's what grandmas are for.
Because....
Do you and Michael ever talk about his work...?  About spending so much time working in the water?
I can't help it....
Do you enjoy dealing blackjack?
Part of me wanted to go off with him, the rest of me couldn't...I don't know why he wants me....
I don't know what he thinks...I don't know what I think...I don't even know why I'm talking about it...  It's silly...I'm getting too old for this sort of thing....
I'm hungry, Mom....
You can stay in my room.
I'm still five....
You're silly....
Thanks for the consultation....
I'll miss you....
I won't have anyone in my family any- where near the water....  Never again...Never....
It picked Sean...It killed your father....
Your brother's dead...Your father's dead....
Come on, I'll show you around.
Mom, please don't start that again....
I'm pleased.  I really am.  Really....
I'm fine....
I have to get this finished.
There's nothing to worry about....
I don't want to talk about that.
Why'd you come out here?
I always listen to my feelings....
It could have been an accident....
No one does till they learn....
Where do I pull off...?
They took me to the chief, who took a long look at me, then took me in his hut....
It's wonderful....
I have my own little island.
What?
I'm sorry...I....
You're the man who drives the plane.
Just like that?
Yes I can....
We'll buy you one.  We're having a party....
She'll be all right, partner.. She'll never find it.  We couldn't....
What's that....?
I fly elephants for smugglers....
Still chasing fish?
She's a tough lady....
Oh, boy....
The females have eggs....
A blind man could find more conch on a mountainside....
You leave me high and dry...You come back looking like a zombie....
Put me down....
Put me down, damnit....
I didn't do it on purpose....
Forget it....
Don't say anything about this to my mother....
As the sun slowly sets in the West, we bid a fond farewell to the family of conch....
We got it together, Jake....
So did I....
Lots of times....
What the hell does Hoagie have to do with this?
As long as he's been here....
What do you know about him?
You'll be the eternal tropo...The old man and the sea...Know the words to this one?  'Oh, the shark has pretty teeth, dear, and he shows them pearly white...'
You don't like my voice...?
Tough shit.  'When the shark bites with his teeth, dear...'
Mom....
I've got to get to her....
It'll work....
Don't flatter yourself.... 
I just want to make an honest woman of you....
I'm training to....
Claims kids come around at night and tip over his sleeping cows.  They're not giving milk.
No, Jakie, no. I-I-I-
I hope I'm not intruding?
Since when did you drink diet soda?
Seven thirty-five .. Here, "Town Gets Top Cop." I was gonna pin it to your wall.
Why don't you throw them all away, and smoke none?
I dunno .. I guess this is staff side of the building?
Then give me that Zippo.
How come the F.B.I. don't put anya this together? They work- ed over "Jennifer" for months?
What does it matter what I bel- ieve? .. What you gotta worry about is what Citrine believes ..
No God, Brother. If there was a God, asses wouldn't be at the perfect height for kicking.
You don't really believe this?
I spose I'm drinking myself to sleep. It's Helena's Christmas songs .. they're really pretty ..
This "cop" that's calling, thinks she gonna be there over Christmas.
Hey ..
Hair on her hand. Plus Jen- nifer had raven black hair.
I'm not telling you what to do. What I will say, is <u>right</u> <u>now</u>, that child's tricycle there is more important to me than this ..
No.
Is that my punishment for embarrassing Mr Heineman?
You ain't talking to no one, till you calm down.
Fucken noddle's hanging off ..
I've heard you call him Freddy.
As she's a member of my staff, may I ask what this is about?
What kind of friend? Was he a boy friend? An old friend? New friend?
Why not? You heard my voice?
No, it has a mind of its own.
My hands?
.. sorry your father, mother sis- ter, whatever .. I couldn't take another day of it .. Come on, I'm gonna rob you of a cup of coffee ..
Coz you hardly said a word since you got here. But you been thinking pretty loud ..
It's not possible right now.
I can't identify him ..
I'm blind because my father drank.
I don't want them to arrest you.
I been told to take your car in, Sir.
I dunno, Sir. Brought you up a Chevy.
Yes, Sir.
No, Sergeant, I got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who. And I might add, that in another six weeks, a hundred and fifty students will be leaving here, & driving away for their Christmas holidays with pe- ople whose name I-won't-know-either ..
You know, he crashed. He just couldn't come to terms with it .. John hates to lose, and he hated losing her .. Every spare minute, he's driving down to San Diego, having a terrible time with her, getting drunk, and driving back .. you just don't believe the amount he drank ..
Think he still thinks about her. But not like then. Then was an obsession.
Tonight I'm feeling lucky ..
Even better.
No, c'mon, Freddy, let's have this out & over. You know what everyone thinks? They think you're making a case coz you found yourself a nice piece of ass. And no one's blaming you for it, I hear she's worth the flowers. But don't come in here get- ting holy over us. Sure I put it in the paper. Coz I wanted to <u>stop</u> this bullshit. I don't want you drunk out- ta your head searching my office ag- ain. it's pissing <u>me</u>, & <u>everyone</u> off.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
I know about the bachelor party.
One of the accountants.
Could you just stop moving?
No.
There is something missing here.
No.
Yeah, Dotty. You did. _ 50.
Hey, man, tonight I'm going to teach Ray about jazz.
I see what you're saying.
"Something in the way.  Yeah."
Oh come on --
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Well, take care.
Dorothy.  Ray.  A pleasure.
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Absolutely.
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
Well, I'm happy for you.
Sure.
Sorry about this hand.  You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
Same to you.
Right.  I'll come in.
Easy, easy --
Fine, I just --
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Why do you love me?
Tell me -- let me help --
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
Of course I know --
At eleven at night? _ 70.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
Okay.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Why the fuck am I here?  I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
Yeah.  And it might have even worked too.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Very much.
Huh?
Why not?
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
I missed ya.  What can I say?
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Jerry.  You two will be together forever.
Not a chance.
What DO you stand for???
Don't be silly.
I'm freakin out.  Oh God I'm --
"Stay calm?"  I'm freakin...
The best commercial director in the business.  I hail you.
I came here to let you go. _ 27.
I know.  It sucks.  I suck.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
Funny.
Right up ahead, buddy --
We've arranged for a private airplane to take us flying over Isla Sorna. And we want you to be our guide.
What?
A friend. We were vacationing. Eric wanted to see the island and the dinosaurs, so Ben found a guy who would take them parasailing. They never came back.
People change.
Dr. Grant says this, Dr. Grant says that...
Nothing.
No, it's...
It’s not about him. It's Eric. He's alone out here somewhere. Our baby is all alone.
We have to help him.
I want to find them too, but we can't do a bit of good right now. For every scary thing we saw in the daylight, I'll bet there ten times more of 'em at night.  Am I right?
We're not going anywhere, I promise.
I'm trying! That thing took him down this way!
Here!
What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
Just hold on.
I know. I know. I want to look for him too.
He loves you too.
Sure.
They're here.
No way. This is lucky. Couple years ago some buddies and I went hang gliding off these cliffs in New Zealand. Updraft sent me right into the side. BOOM!
It was this strap alone that saved my life. Got caught on a rock as I was falling.
Mr. and Mrs. Kirby! If you look out the right you can see...
Obviously a superpredator.  Suchimimus. that snout.
Sorry, Alan it's been six years.
Really?  What do you do there?
You think they could talk to each other?
Goodbye, Alan.
You'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.
Which one do you prefer?
Are you sure?
She's the one person I could always count on. And she's saved me more times than she realizes. I owe her everything.
You should.
There is. I own a place called Kirby Paint and Title Plus. We're out in the Westgate Shopping Center in Enid, Oklahoma. The "plus" is for bathroom fixtures, fireplaces accessories, patio furniture. Stuff like that.
Back out! Move!
Just a little bit too much, I think.
Minimal.
It doesn't matter what I think.
Because I didn't know!  I don't have the faintest idea what they're doing here.
Well?  Didn't it all seem a trifle compact to you?
After the accident at the park, a hurricane wiped out our facility on Site B.  We had to evacuate and leave the animals to fend for themselves. And they did.  For four years I've fought to keep them safe from human meddling, now I want you to go there and document them.
Ian, you are my last chance to give something of real value to the world. I can't walk so far and leave no footprints; die and leave nothing with my name on it.  I will not  be known only for my failures.  And you will not allow yourself to go down in history as a lunatic.  You're too smart.  You'e too proud.  Dr. Malcolm.  Please.  This is a chance at redemption.  For both of us. There's no time to equivocate, we must seize it now, before --
-- my --
Dr. Malcolm -- the world -- owes you an apology.
Kelly!  What are you doing here?
That was about a year ago.
Out of the question.  You'd miss the gymnastics trials.  You've been training for that for a year.
This is nothing like Austin.  Forget about it.
Where does it say that?
You heard his, Dieter.  Find a new spot.  And remember, we're after herbivores only -- no unnecessary risks.
To collect my fee.
I once saw a bull elephant die charging a jeep.  All the jeep had done was startle the bull's calves. I saw a lioness carry wounded prey four and a half miles, all the way back to its den, just to teach its cubs how to finish off a kill.
Rex won't be any different.  It'll come.
The velociraptors.
Good.
Let it go, Peter.  The animal won.
Do me a favor.  Don't pretend for a second that you and I don't know the truth.  You can convince Time magazine and the Skeptical Inquirer of whatever you want, but I was there.
Don't ask me.  The guy's completely out to lunch.
Where's Kelly?
Funded by whom?
Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it-
Runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.
Rotten luck, this storm.  Get my grandchildren on the radio will you?  I don't want them to worry about a wee bit of rain.
Yeah, again, in  theory, but - -
Dodgson, Dodgson.  We got Dodgson here!  See, nobody cares.  Nice hat. What are you trying to look like, a secret agent?
I was wondering, how are you planning to beat the security?
Shhhhh!
Are you sure?
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
A carousel - - and a seesaw.  They all moved, motorized of course, but people would swear they could see the fleas.  "I see the fleas, mummy!  Can't you see the fleas?" Clown fleas, high wire fleas, fleas on parade... 
That's good.  That's right!  They died around a dried-up puddle!  Without fighting each other.  This is looking good.
Oh, Ellie, look.  They're noisy, they're messy, they're sticky, they're expensive.
They do smell.  Some of them smell.. babies smell.
The Cretaceous.
Yeah, plenty.  Some of them can't walk!
Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
What kind of park is it?
We were right!
We're out of a job.
Dilophosaurus.
It's my favorite.
Yes, unless they figured out how to open doors.
I can't get it!  I can't get it unless I move!
The fences are electrified, right?
The other car!
What's that?
You can't just stroll down the road, you know.
Okay.
We'll discuss sexism in survival situations when I get back.  You just take me through this step by step.  I'm on channel two.
Like hell it is!
I get ah - -
It changed.  Why?  Okay, back over your wrist.  Because and here is the principle of tiny variations - - the orientations of the hairs - -
Microscopic - - never repeat, and vastly affect the outcome.  That's what?
No one could have predicted Dr. Grant would suddenly jump out of a moving vehicle!
Juanito, if they pull the funding, that will really slow things down.  If they pull the funding that's going to slow things down around here.
Grant?  You'll never get him out of Montana.
Because he's like me.  He's a digger.
And the concrete moats, and the motion sensor tracking systems.  Donald, dear boy, do try to relax and enjoy yourself.
Tim.  Which car were you planning on - -
Triceratops was a constant browser, and constant browsers would be constantly sick.
That's okay.  Listen, give me your hand.
This is impossible.  How am I going...I can't make it. This is...it's about fifty feet.
It's so strong!  Look at its nose.  Need help?
You're crazy!  I'm not gonna jump!
You have no idea.
You haven't touched  didn't touch anything.  We're stopping.  We've stopped.
You want to talk about this?
For today, I guarantee it.
What kind of opinions?
The brachiosaur?  Thirty.
Wu?
Dr. Grant!  Dr. Grant!
No, I didn't hear anything.  No, we're okay.
Oh, I hate the other kind.
It's okay!  It's okay!  It's a brachiosaur!
Codswollop!  Ian, you've never come close to explaining these concerns of yours about this island!
Dr. Grant, Dr. Sattler -- you've heard of Chaos Theory?
John, the kind of control you're attempting is not possible.  If there's one thing the history of evolution has taught us, it's that life will not be contained. Life breaks free.  It expands to new territories.  It crashes through barriers.  Painfully, maybe even.. dangerously, but and...well, there it is.
You're all right, John You're okay.  It's just you don't have intelligence.  You have "thinktelligence."  You think narrowly and call it "being focused."  You don't see the consequences.  You're very good at solving problems, at getting answers - - but you just don't know the right questions.
I'm sorry about your financial problems.  I really am. But they are your problems.
There's no sign of him anywhere.
Sure.
Excellent.
Turn it off, Lex!  Turn it off!
Shut up!  You're scaring me.  Stop!  You're scaring me.
Do you think they like the fact that tourism has dropped ninety-eight percent in the last ten years?
Logging? We'll need an environmental impact study for that...
Great.
Yeah. Ken said there was another guy there... _big_ guy... then he dropped the phone. What's going on?
That's my job.
I know how this sounds, but that's what happened.
What?
No. When you put me on the stand, I'll say your client is catatonic and exhibits classic symptoms of a schizophrenic, sociopathic personality.  And he doesn't sleep.
None of that's true?
You're obviously going through a critical moral dilemma. And you're putting up barriers against anyone who tries to probe your conscience.  But it is heartening to know that you do have a conscience.
Now.... according to the file, Krueger was burned to death in a fire in 1968. But get this -- beginning in 1984, there was _another_ series of murders in Springwood. All teenagers... all killed in their sleep... all killed with finger blades just like Krueger's.
Don't you see? Jason was _asleep_. And he was dreaming -- the REM patterns prove that. And I saw finger blades just like Krueger's come out of Jason's chest. There has to be a connection.
Great.	When can you do it?
How's that possible?
Alone... but with a murderous fury inside him... which led him to kill dozens of people.
Except this victim got away. I wonder if --
I used to go hunting with my father when I was a kid.
What is it really?
What was the matter with it?
You were his friend.  One link is all they need.
-- Small.
I don't know what you could have read.
I haven't got the energy.  I mean, I have to conserve my energy.
There is <u>one</u> thing I'd like you to tell me.
What made you think <u>I'd</u> be able to get you into the Castle?
In a manner of speaking.
No, I left it in his office.
You're detestable.
You must make the time.  Where do you go off to in the lunch hour?
Have you never wondered -- and I mention this only in passing --  why other clerks have advanced to more responsible positions while you, who have been here longer, have not?
-- Yes -- Raban -- but he was too much like you -- even more so perhaps.  He wasn't here as long as you, so I didn't know him as well -- but I could see the influence he was having.  I simply want you to be aware of this because you'll be happier for it.
I know.
Why would you suppose so?
This morning it was suggested to me that my own sense of office fellowship could bear improving.
Two or three months, that's all.  -- I seduced him.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
Last year.  I -- it was broken off.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
They're ubiquitous.  What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
People must think the same of me -- a quiet, dependable person.
Why were you given notice?
Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
Wednesday.  We left the office together.
No, we said goodbye outside the building.  He went off, as usual, toward his house.
No, I suppose not.
That's not what I call conclusive evidence of an abduction.
It's all right to be sarcastic in private to us -- because we have a sense of humor -- but when we're up at the Castle we suggest you don't make a fuss.  It would spoil the not unfavorable impression you make in other respects.
When a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...
A mere slip.  Your friend Mr. Raban dealt only with claims that came <u>in</u>, another department being responsible for compensation that goes out -- this is correct?
... A piece of paper ...
It usually is.
Whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.
Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain.  A great loss.
These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
My mother used to tell us of the young man who decided to ride to the next village and how she was afraid that -- not even mentioning accidents -- the span of a normal happy life might fall far short of the time needed for such a trip.
It's ... lovely.
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
Now Ann ...
I photographed it extensively, father.
Now now, Ann! Try be to polite.
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
A man eater! Fantastic!  Making history, Herb
Jack ... You get to save the girl and I get my third act! It's gonna be good for you and good for me!
Yeah? ... Well, I gave 'em a taste of American lead ... and I don't see 'em coming back for seconds!
What?
How about Ann? Is she going with you?
Yeah.
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
She was with you after she left Frank.
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
Please --
Yes?
You think people hate you.
No.
No, that's not --
Mm.
No, I'm look --
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
OK.
I go on rounds.
What do you think?
No.
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
I don't see anything, do you?
No, I said what did you think.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
-- Then you don't need me.
I don't get you.
I don't like getting splashed.
Mm.
What am I supposed to say?
Don't touch anything.
OK.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
How is it back there?
Well as a matter of --
Yeah.
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
Someone's been doing all these things.
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead.  I want a look at it anyhow.
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
It's not so bad.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
Goodbye, Pete.
Two years ago? Sorry.
Did she talk about him to you?
Are you with plant security, Sergeant?
Yeah.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
What else do you know?
Trask --
He's in his room, playing.
Not particularly.
The prospect of losing my child.
What about your mommy?
Greatest...
Show...
Wow!  French toast, really?
Right.  One O.J. coming up.
Uh huh...
In a minute...
That's terrific.  That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this--  Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over.
Some of the brown stuff is still there.
I love you...
It's okay, son...I'm here... Just a little more to go... Don't worry, son...I'm here...
You like it?
Sure.
I guess about the same kind of things you do.
Why does he decide?
Sustained.
Yes, your honor.
Does the witness deny the injury took place?
Six years.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
Your honor, I would like to place in evidence a report on Mrs. Kramer's therapy by her therapist, Dr. Elinore Freedman of La Jolla, California.
Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child?
Your honor, I'm only examining the man's employment record.  He pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.
Thank you.  I have no further questions.
What?!  What do you mean, I don't understand.
How many lovers have you had-- permanently?
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Okay, okay...What is it this time? What did I do now?...
I'm listening, Joanna--believe me, I'm listening.  My wife is walking out on me after eight years of--
Such as?
I mean it Ted, you're running this one.
I'm going to be okay.  The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
I don't know, Jim...
Jim, I appreciate what you're saying.  I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
Hey, Ted.  C'mon in.  I wanna' talk to you.
Murray had some ideas about the Fire and Ice campaign and he had the art department make up a few roughs...  I think they're kind of interesting.
That's my decision, Ted and that's final.
Are you firing me, Jim?
Sure.
Mmmmnph...I'll get you a cab...
Right.
I'm going to take it.
But it's not a year from now, is it?
Walk him over to Bethesda Fountain, buy him an ice.  It'll kill twenty minutes.
I know....I know.
No.  Uh, uh.  Tell him I asked for it Friday.  I want it Friday. Period.
I don't know, John...I mean, to be brutally honest, I'm not so sure what kind of mental shape Joanna's in right now.  Y'know she admitted she was seeing a shrink.
Oh, Christ.. .John, there's some- thing I ought to tell you.  My... ah, situation has...changed.  I lost my job.
Ted, I won't lie to you, we don't have a hope in hell of winning a custody hearing if you're out of work.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
No.
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay.  But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
Thelma, I've lost my wife, I'm not losing my child.
Got it.
No, not really...  I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?"  That's really true.
Look,  I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay?  I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
Ted, I just heard...
Kham, Holiness.
Again?
Can I do anything I want?
Here. We'll collect them.
You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
I will not approve it.
And we will begin with tearing it down.
General Chiang.
Soon.
We did not.
Yes. Most of the Chamdo region is now in Chinese hands. There is a report from Chamdo which makes quite clear that, unless some settlement can soon be reached, Communist troops will soon be marching on Lhasa.
Yes.
At dawn, you were born. One eye was closed, and your sister opened it with her thumb. We gave you the sweet drink.
I miss my brother.
What do you think?
I am him.
Please.
Can India help us?
The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers -- they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
I will not go.
Arrange for me to speak to the people's leaders.
He was always nice to me. He found me. He saw me in his dreams.
You will always!
Does he have the spot?
True.
Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.
And you have grown older and your chin has grown balder.
They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
Do you remember the day I came to your monastery, when I was a baby? And you comforted me?
Buddha teaches that we must learn from our enemy. We have compassion for all people.
The land has stayed in the family. We work together. The nobleman is not too bad.
Oh yes.  I killed him.
Nobody <u>lives</u> on this lake.  it's really <u>his</u> lake now.
Go ahead.
I apologize, I just don't want to lose the light, we've got time for a quick scout,  you've had work done.
Mr. Cyr!
They have saltwater glands, they can swim across oceans, it's only a matter of time.
Cocktail?
I coulda shot you, you--
No thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.  Could you please cut me down?
It came from across the lake.
Raincheck.
Then do it!!
Forget about him being God, he's thirty feet long, he <u>is</u> a miracle of nature, who somehow made his way to Maine.  This is a grand beast. <u>A</u> <u>grand</u> <u>dragon</u>.  An attempt should at least be made to capture him alive.
I don't know!
Right.
Women's intuition.  Are there anymore?
Nothing's real.
Guess I finally got bit.
Jack Wells.  A museum sent you?
Big but... a bear couldn't do that to a moose or man in <u>water</u>.  On <u>land</u> maybe.  But...
I'd be able to see something.
I thought I might track the shoreline tomorrow, look for prints.
Yeah.  I got some stuff for your cut.
I wonder if he's some kind of mutant.  That bear had to be surprised.
Take him.
No, I actually <u>want</u> to stay for a little while.
Yeah.
Worth a try.  We don't wanna be alone forever, do we?
Good thinking.
Ready.  A museum in New York sent us some additional back up.
Let's go.
White perch.
So does he.
And you didn't see <u>anything</u>?
I can look at dead things.
Lightweight Forward Area air device unit.  Whatever's out there, one shot with this and he's dead.
It's just that--
Was he swallowed?
I thought I saw...
I asked you to be nice to him.
Hector thinks you like him.
She's worried about the cow now.
Me too.
The somebody else part?
Else.
It's ten after nine.
It started <u>before</u> you, Kelly, I never would've--
Kelly--
Well, except for the one girl.
Hot damn, Clarice.
Get me out!
Dr. Chilton, I told you - this is just routine follow-up on the Raspail case.
Lecter has already named Buffalo Bill.
Sir, doesn't this "William Rubin" strike you as - I don't know - kind of vague?
Might I suggest tucking your pants into your socks? To prevent mouse intrusion.
Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling.
Jack Gordon.
Yes. I bought the house from her, two years ago.
I hope so. They haven't posted anything.
You're qualified and available. And frankly, I can't spare a real agent right now.
It's all there, sir, practically verbatim.
Right down to the kleenex I used.  Sir, why? Is something wrong?
Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on -
I'm here, sir, I just - I don't know how to feel about it.
Then have the lab check Raspail's head.  Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon.
He's already offered to help... What would happen if we just showed our cards - asked him for Bill?
Transfer to a new prison. With a view of trees, he said, or even water... Can we swing that?
But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me!
Starling -
Sewing...
They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs.
Where does Mrs. Lippman live? I'd like to talk to her.
I think so.
May I see your credentials?
He said - "I can smell your cunt."
All that detail, just from memory...?
Do you know why he's called Buffalo Bill? Tell me. The newspapers won't say.
I didn't.
A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti... Fly back to school, little Starling.
Why? Do you know something about him?
That doesn't interest me, Doctor. And it's the sort of thing Miggs would ask.
Buffalo Bill...?  Bill killed him, all those years ago...? That's impossible.
Was it a butterfly?
You're very frank, Clarice. I think - it would be quite something to know you in private life.
Why so briefly?
How very thoughtful... Or did Crawford send you here for one last wheedle - before you're both booted off the case?
No. We just -
Dr. Lecter, when there's time I'll -
And - one morning I just - ran away...
No. First I tried to free them... I opened the gate of their pen - but they wouldn't run. They just stood there, confused. They wouldn't run...
Yes...
Toughened your nipples, didn't it...?  Six foot one, strongly built, about 190 pounds. Hair brown, eyes pale blue. He'd be about 35 now. He said he lived in Philadelphia, but may have lied. That's really all I can remember, Senator - but if I think of any more, I'll let you know.
No fair! You lured him with produce.
Officer Starling. Welcome back.
The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that?
Can we rest soon?
Duncan, you are absolutely gallant. If Cora doesn't marry you, I shall.
Let us go, miss.
Anyone lookin' to pick up our trail, would see it as a sign of our passing...
Yes. He said... "do not try to make them understand you."
Why did they turn back?
In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison.  Why were those people living in this defenseless place...?
Yes. I want you to go.
There was none!
He delivered no such message.
Duncan...  Duncan, I promised you an answer. You have complimented me with your persistence and patience... But the decision I've come to is I'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.
You are defending him because you've become infatuated with him.
What the bloody hell plan is this?
What are they doing to Duncan? Duncan!
He is Huron and nothing else.  Why would he want to murder the girl?
I ought to have you whipped from this fort!
You will have to forego the pleasure of hangin' me.
: Only one or two loads.
We'll see in the morning...
You're not coming with us?
No.  Huron serve no one. The French father believes he fooled Magua because he is so proud of his cleverness, he is blind. But it is the Huron path that Magua walks down, not the French one... Now, Les Francais, also, fear Huron. That is good. When the Huron is strong from their fear, we will make the terms of trade with Les Francais. And we will trade as the white man trades. Take land from the Abnakes; fur from the Osage, Sauk & Fox. And make the Huron great. Over other tribes. No less than the whites, as strong as the whites.
...not enough time to get to Albany and back with reinforcements...
And what is that?
I know.  One has to give Americans "reasons" and make agreements to get them to do anything at all.  Tiring, isn't it?  But that's the way of it here.
Might I enquire after the situation, sir, given that I've seen of the French engineering from the ridge above?
Terrible feature of war in the Americas.  Best to keep your sight fixed on our duty.
And who empowered these provincials to pass judgment upon England's policies in her own colonies? To come and go without so much as a "by your leave."
General Webb can burn in hell. We'll go back and dig our graves behind the ramparts! Our mission is to fight.
The decision is final.
Does Yengeese Major have property across salt sea?
Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
And I to make yours, Monsieur le Marquis.
Monsieur le Marquis, I am a soldier, not a diplomat. You called this parlay for a reason.
However I may apprise such testimony from Monsieur Montcalm, Fort William Henry is strong and stands.
My master requires the fort be destroyed.  But, for you and your comrades, there is no privilege that will be denied. None of your men will see the inside of a prison barge. They're free to go so long as they return to England and fight no more on this continent, and the civilian militia return to their farms.
Carry them to England to your King with pride.
Il est necessaire d'etre vigilant, mon enfant.
Well, I'll be on the golf course in the morning.  Then, if I don't have any babies to deliver--
These observers were doing something. A test...I think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.
But what about those scales... or that leech-like thing that bit Cobb?
Don't worry, I don't want to give up any more.
What has?
What dead one on the ship?
Think!  Can we stop it?! Block it up?!  Shut down the line somewhere?!  Think!
No.
I got hung up!  Try this!
How do you know it was Williams?
Why can't we pick up his signal?
Good...It's going good.
I need electrical field experience on my resume. Everything helps...  Why are you here?
Yeah...I think they're just deciding what to do with us.
Seeing how my stock's doing...
How much time does that give us?
Where's Jones?
Jones...come with me.  Cobb, you and Doc check the rooms.
Roger.
Okay.
And it killed Bo?
What you don't understand is that my crew is in jeopardy.
I'm not anxious to find out, either.
Do it.
I realize you must have gone through hell--
Not yet.
Fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them.  It Doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!
Aw, loosen up, Bowman...  Hey, Willie, I got one served up for you.
Hook's on 24...
I ain't, goddamnit...It's Jones!..
I'm going to kill it!
Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...
We're simply concerned about her...proximity to...
Let's hope it holds.
Sixpack...
Sorry, darling...Just thought a little humor would loosen us all up...you know?...
He's a stroppy sod but he's got more balls than a golfer, only he doesn't know it. ' * Cut from completed film.
Stop fucking around, Tom, and think. What are we going to do?
Well, it's still a good idea.
Sex and sleaze and antique shotguns are all deep and dear in Harry's stone cold heart.
I would rather put my money on a three-legged rocking horse. The odds are a hundred to one for a good reason, BACON . . . it won't win. So where is Ed with all the bright ideas?
And nobody wants to live next door to the people that we live next to; a bit anti-social, you know.
I'll meet you in the van when you have finished with handsome there.
Apart from those shotguns.
Where're the others?
Oh, you must be the brains then. That's right, guns that fire shot . . . Make sure you bring everything from inside the gun cabinet. There will be a load of guns, that's all I want. I'll pay you when you deliver. Everything outside the cabinet you can keep; it's yours.
It's a fucking stately home, of course there'll be something there.
Can I help?
No Harry, you can't.
It looks like ít, but who knows? The opportunity was there. In my experience it is best to take the opportunity if it is there.
I won't be seeing you again Chris; I have paid him every last penny.
Made a few quid, did ya? Now where is it?
Well, you had better go and get it from the office. That's if you want to see your son reach his next birthday. Now chop-fuckin'-chop.
Try that one.
All right, Dad.
This is dangerous shit, Dean; we don't even know who lives in there.
Er well, yes we do.
There is no such thing as easy in my experience and, if you think this is going to be easy, you're a dick. It may be easier than most but it's not going to be easy.
Just hold on, I got the keys.
OK, open the gate.
Well we have got about a hundred thousand pretty pieces of paper with the Queen on it. Will that do?
I don't know, but what I do know is that there's no more Harry, which means there's no more debt, and if there's no more debt there's no more problem, and there's no more problem with our neighbours because they are all dead. I think, if I get this right, we haven't done anything wrong anyway, which means we are in the clear.
Right as rain.
What do you mean, me?
. . . What?
No, you need five hundred grand to see me.
It's Ed, if that's what you mean.
I wanted to talk to you about that.
I like your bar.
Look, could you just open the door so I could talk without shouting?
I got contacts. Listen Tom, if you pointed them at me I'd shit myself or do whatever you said to do. Either way you still get the desired effect.
Range? I don't want to blow the arse out of this country, granted, but I don't want anybody blowing a raspberry at me either. I want to look fucking mean.
That's going on optimism.
When the bottle in my arse has contracted I'll let you know.
Tom, the fatter you get, the sadder you get.
Just shut up.
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
Oh, come on, Amado--
Leave your sister out of it.
They stole our land--
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
The--the officers.
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
No, sir. Not at all.
Yes, sir.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
Yes, Sergeant.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
You got to investigate. No question about it.
You're fired. You're outta the department.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
What?
If it's too late--
No sir.
They fought against the Indians?
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
You own this place?
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
You know who it was they dug up?
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
That's where he fell.
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
Protection?
Aqui! [Here!]
Aqui! Venga por aqui! [Over here! Come this way!]
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
We was crossin' the river--
Es mi novia. [She's my girlfriend.]
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
You go by your old house?
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though.  You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
Do you?
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
Well, you hire illegals--
A little older than Paloma is now.
You ever play one of these?
And that was the last time you saw him?
And when my father was Sheriff?
Yeah?
I only went for my last two years.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
Well, you were working there--
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
Most people did, yeah.
Yeah.
Pilar--
Yeah.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
Pilar--
What was your father's name?
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
Yeah--
I been working on a few things.
This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here--
You sell much out here?
Runnin' numbers illegal.
You going to tell him?
Have a nice evening, Mr. D'Amour.
How?
Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.  Her lawyer was driving. She was filing for divorce.
My life was too weird for her.
Nope.
doorway) And who's that?
Hey, anytime.  Actually, no.  This was enough.
D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour.
Right.
Why would I do that?
All right.  It was...
About?
What about death?
It's him... it's him.
And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years?
Yes.
I'm no bodyguard.
I heard what happened.  It looks like somebody murdered him.
They won't tell you anything.
Yes.  I think you probably can.  We'd need to talk about your fee.
Why?  Because he had you?
You didn't marry him for love.
It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go.
I didn't leave.  I was just digging around.
I wasn't.
I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it.
Don't be.  Nix can't hurt you now.
And they all came...
Harry...
Yeah.  Remember Quaid?
So could you walk on water?
Have you got a job that'll pay you five thousand a day?
You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour.  I work for the best illusionist in the world.
Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist.
You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief.  Here's thirty thousand dollars.
No.
Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter?
We've got to get you to a hospital.
What about?
Not much.
It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation.
Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her.
Is that all?
Is that all?
No.
He's better off this way.
In my time, and nobody else's.
What?
And he's dead?
Ok, you're scheduled to leave Saturday, but we'll hold a seat Thursday in case, but first class is full, you're waitlisted for an upgrade... there might be a seat on Lufthansa...
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
I'm here for the week.
Hi, Charlie.
Ok.
OK, see you downstairs.
I see them every morning.
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Yeah, you don't remember?
No, you smiled.
I know, I kind of blend in here.
Ok, whatever you want.
No, yes, it does...
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
We should get you to the doctor.
No.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Oh?
Hello, darling.
Is there anything I can do?
Alright?
Fine.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Do you want to- 
That's ok.
Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!
Thank you, Mr. Harris.
Excuse me?
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
Bye.
Ok, have fun there, you're so lucky you don't have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan... call me when you get back.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I've been sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours...
It's probably trivial.
Bad?
Sushi.
I found the pentacle.
And how would you describe him?
On the day of the murders  what did the defendant request?
Tell the jury how many people work in that office with you and Mr. Viznick.
My secretary?
Of course not.  They put him through severe mental stress.  Causing this aneurysm.
I don't have the experience.  Father Thomas should officiate.
Yeah.  It didn't make any sense.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James.  I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
Don't you get it?  They had their 2,000 years.  Now it's our turn.
I know, Maya, but you'll understand when you see this man.  I really need your strength.
Well, in my prayers, I realized we've been fooling ourselves and probably... blown this all out of proportion.  God would never allow anything like that to happen.
Kelson, hold on a second...
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself.  He created the voices after the fact.
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
I think you gave me the wrong one.
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
Please, the children.
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
What?
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
We millionaires yet?
No, the less mystifying.  Good and evil are only illusions.  There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."  That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
As if there's another cause for little voices?  No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
He's looking right at me.
Sure thing.  Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts.  You can go home.  Gimme til morning.  Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh?  Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
Where is she now?
Nothing.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
To that stewardess?
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
But you use potato?
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
You love to pose so much, let's see it again.
Sort of.
Don't go starting rumors, Jim.  My son's college bound with or without basketball.
I'd love for him to get a good education.  That's it.
You're just scared.  I know rehab is hard, and you have to worry about whether you'll be as good as you were but you will be.  I believe in you.  You just have to get back on the court.  Like you'd get back on a horse.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
How'd you get him to say yes?
Just wanted to say good game.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
Just like that?
Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
I'ma be in the NBA.  You're gonna be my cheerleader.
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
I don't.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He ain't Spalding.
None of your business.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
I know, right?
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA.  You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
What?
My court, I go first.
I wanted you to.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
Yeah, sorry about that.  I had this meeting with this guy.
Are you out of your mind?
I never asked you to choose.
I decided to go pro.  And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
Damnitt, Monica.  This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
Uh huh.
Yup.
Not for Quincy McCall.
Getting there.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Nah.  I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months.  Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
Maybe go back to school.
What?
I don't wanna look fast.  Thanks, girl.
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
I don't care about the team.  I care about the school.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
Okay...
What?
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips."  This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years.  Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart.  We'll just have to see how it plays out.  I'm giving her some space, couple days...
I messed up, okay, I know that.  But I ain't that kid's father.
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
What?
Came by to check on you.
I can't believe you're gonna do this to me, the situation I'm in, I don't -- Avi: You know what?  Being hit by lighting doesn't matter for getting braces, ok? Now Solomon, let me just ask you once: Please. Please. Don't do this.
I'm fuckin' hammered, Burt.
Shut it.  Shut yer fuckin' mouth.
I'm here, I'm listening.
I know -- and I can't really explain that, but I have a feeling there's something, some situation between them, like they don't really know each other much or well, something like they don't talk much anymore --
Brain and Lung.
It's rough.  I'm sorry, did she make it?
...I want to....I want so many things, Claudia. Maybe we can just talk to straighten our things out....there are so many things that I want to tell you --
baby, please, please --
YOU BURN IN BELL.  You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
GET OUT.
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
No one else in there with you?
And that could be the sign of a damaged ear drum, you understand?
You got the TV on too, keep those on at that same time usually?
I'm a bit of a slob myself.
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
-- do you wanna cup?
I don't have a boyfriend.
-- is not my boyfriend.
This is, for not a fresh cup, a great cup of coffee, Claudia --
What's that stand for?
I'm sorry.
Bye.
Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something.  They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
Well I don't go out very much.
I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
I'm sorry --
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
What?
That was so great what you just said.
You don't know how crazy I am.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
What?
I won't say, no, wait, Claudia --
Claudia.
yeah, yes, hi, hello.
How much time do we have?
I should maybe go to the bathroom.
I don't know.
Jesus Christ, Stanley, you can't go to the bathroom now.  You have exactly one minute before we're back on the air, this is NOT the time to go to the bathroom.
NOTHING. NOTHING HAPPEND. GO AWAY.
If he hadn't pissed his pants, we woulda won.  We fucking had this game.
-- no.
Please, boy, put it down and it's ok.
Not yet -- "give you the clue for the bust if you show me some trust --"
Maybe I'm just happy to see my friend, Brad there.
This sounds threatening.
I have love all over.  I even have love for you, friend.
You're a friend of the family I presume?
I used to be smart but now I'm just stupid.
Yes they do, they do, but I'll make my dreams come true, you see?  I will.
Mmm.Hmm.
Stay that way.
You seem the sort of person who confuses the two.
FUCK YOU.  I pay you, I paid you. I give you a fucking chance and a chance and over and over, over you let me down.  I trust you with so much. The keys to my store, the codes to my locks, the life, the blood of my bussiness and return is smashing in seven-eleven, late, <u>always</u> late, loans -- I loaned you money for your kitchen that you never did --
Yes I do.
Don't do this, Don.
Where is he?
She loves you.
There's no asshole like you.
Go fuck myself?
Who are you gonna call?
No.
I'm looking for Frank Mackey.
You got us a room so quick?
So boring, so useless --
-- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of?
This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three --
Mm. Hm.
An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill?
Go ahead and waste your time.
-- fuck you.
Around here.
Well I guess it doesn't.
Not a problem.
...this close...
What name?  My name?
My mother's name, actually. Good question.  You've done you're research.
"Frank" was my mother's father.
I wouldn't want that to be misunderstood: My enrollment was totally unoffical because I was, sadly, unable to afford tuition up there.  But there were three wonderful men who were kind enough to let me sit in on their classes, and they're names are: Macready, Horn and Langtree among others. I was completely independent financially, and like I said: One Sad Sack A Shit. So what we're looking at here is a true rags to riches story and I think that's what most people respond to in "Seduce," And At The End Of The Day? Hey -- it may not even be about picking up chicks and sticking your cock in it -- it's about finding What You Can Be In This World.  Defining It.  Controling It and saying: I will take what is mine.  You just happen to get a blow job out of it, then hey-what-the-fuck- why-not?  he.he.he.
Yeah let's...maybe just stand.
Oh yeah.
Mmm.
yeah.
I got a call of a disturbance, you're door was open, I just wanna see what's goin' on --
Maybe you didn't, but I'm here to find out about a disturbance. Some neighbors called said they heard screaming and a loud crash.
No.
If she asks me any question I want to tell her.  I want to tell her everything I've done.
I won't.
I got in trouble at school.
Yes. Now. Find her. She's somewhere in the building --
I was saying...thinking maybe I'd get my own quiz show someday, Jimmy. Just like you!
It's okay, Stanley. It's alright.
I'm drinking.
Yeah.
Did you ever touch her?
Stay here, please don't leave me, please, please, if I said I knew would you stay?
It's alright.
No.  But I probably will get a call back.
I'll get it because I'm a good actress, Richard.
The money would go to Frank.  The court would put the money in the hands of a relative --
-- unless Frank is specifically ommitted as a beneficiary that's what will happen.
Hang up the phone.
-- what-what-what, ma'am -- I --
Hi. I'd like to get an order for delivery.
That's it.
We need more dog food --
Should be one-thirty.
Sure.
Go to bed.
I have money.
I have money to give you.
That is good.
I couldn't tell you.  You had enough to carry.
I wish to discuss your brother.
First they told me he had died at birth.  Then your father admitted he was alive, but well cared for, in secret.  But the message that told of his death said he had been a prisoner.
Excellent, Athos.  You have a keen sense of this man.
There is that, of course -- but mainly it is because I am so much smarter than everyone else.
Resting, he's had a long day. Aramis --
Three days??!!
So what has changed?
Aramis -- the King wishes to see you.
Be quiet, you fat fool.  Can't you see I'm praying?
Forgiveness?
No, not Louis!
What use am I?
Come on...
Then let him kill me, if all my faith is wrong.
Who?
We will make our own luck tonight... if Phillippe holds up.
Who does?
You are right.  But it is a trap.
Raoul --
Athos, my friend!
Midnight!  Mon dieu!  Driving the youngsters hard, eh?
I was feeling sorry for myself. Raoul is getting married, he proposed today!  I love that boy beyond all measure, I've spent everything I own to give him education and opportunity.  Now he has complete happiness, and I mope.
I fear I know our King.  I came to try to bring you hope.
I know.
You trust his character more than anyone else does.
I will sit with you.  I can't sleep either.
No!  Do not be sorry!  Never be sorry!  The King cares for nothing and for no one!  There are no mistakes when you are King!  What you do is right for every person!  A King has contempt for everyone!
Whose rooms are those?
How did you --
Just... water.
Who came?
And you never knew why?
I decided it this morning.
I am King, d'Artagnan.  I will change my mind as I wish, and I will enjoy my banquet as I wish!
It is not Raoul's heart alone that concerns me.  It is yours.  I know you find women compliant -- especially the poorer ones like Michelle.  But do they love you?  Do you love them?  What about a queen to love?  A son of your own?
There is more to love than he knew, or that you know.
Order Fromberge to keep him in safety!  It is the least you can do, to protect your own honor!
Thank you, your Majesty.
Forgive?!
There.
Thank you, Keeper.
Not by you.  I will order d'Artagnan to do it.
How did I get in?  You're new here, and will soon learn many secrets. What is that?
Or worse, we'll have a hostage situation on our hands.
It happened too fast.  He was in the back, quiet and calm and boom! He was out - and gone.  We...we fanned out...Stanton must have let his guard down!
Oh for Chrissakes it could have happened to anyone of--
I didn't hit shit!
Fine...
Fine -
Yeah I saw 'em around.  They worked vice.
That's got to our secret agent man! Do we have an address?
Mm-hmm...that's not what the bartender told us.
Could explain why Fleming was there.
He said he was following up some lead.
I lost him - I heard shots - that way!!
I got out of there.	I just grabbed up my stuff, and then I found it.
Well...whatsamatter?  Run in with the law?
This is Tubbs. Sorry I can't answer the phone, I'm out square dancing. Leave a message--
Hello Tubbs.  Can I come in?
Yeah I'm sure!  I did it with my own hands!
Shit, what I have now made our setup in Angola look like Tinker Toys.  I've been skipping through Internal Revenue records all day. I even have video strip poker. You want to check it out?
Are you serious?  My boyfriend ditched me...
Screw him!
County jail - get in.
Yeah, and that's all I'm going to say. If you want to arrest me, go ahead...
Could he handle a direct contact?
The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them.  I don't have an answer for you.  Listen to me, my friend: leave this.
It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
Book code?
I don't want to talk about it anywhere.  If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon.
What else did you keep out of the papers?
As long as they're dead...
I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect.
He's working on the single print index. What time is it?
We're running it through the computers now. So far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. Plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. It's a haystack.  What's the other?
The mark? Yes.
Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds?
What is it?
...there's three 't's' and an 'r' in Tattler.
We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
When I'm done.
'Changes?'
VTR, film, Polaroid, stills, what?
There is none! We've run it through the computer a dozen times.
Let's admit we struck out this month. The Gulf Stream's standing by. The basic lab stuff is on it.  You, Zeller, Jimmie Price, a photographer. Anywhere he hits, we can be there in an hour and fifteen minutes. We get the call, we roll. The scene'll be very fresh...
Stay in the trees.
Wait for the back-up! Will?
He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."'
He went to the men's room.
Tonic will be fine.
No! Don't go back into the house...  It's too nice outside.
Francis? Where are you?
No!
My back hurts, my skin. Did I get burned? I hope to God I'm not burned.
Let me lie down.  Listen, I want to call my office. My God, I'm in a Stryker frame.  My back's broken. Tell me the truth.
Not me.
No.
'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand.  'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you.  'I will be a testament to the truth, now.  About his work. About his becoming.'
No.
Well, it's about goddamn time!  I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and....
It's written on toilet tissue.  'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming.  'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming.  Just as the source of light is burning.  Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched out, then it says...  'I have a complete collection of your press notices.  I think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate.  Investigator Graham interests me.  Very purposeful looking. I hope we can correspond.  There's another piece missing here. I'll read the bottom part.  'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet.  Signed: Avid Fan.  It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom.
Hi, Linda. ..
We're looking for Graham. The man the book is supposed to go to is a Mr. Will Graham.
Cut the general crap.
Let's keep it the day-to-day stuff.  How's Kevin?
Yeah. Ah... yellow, let's paint it yellow.
Yes. I said this is too good to live...
No.
I have to go back to Birmingham.
No. I have to be in there...  alone. Maybe there's something for me if I know how he feels and thinks.
Mama has all Kevin's uncles and aunts coming down from Cheyenne next week and...
Go on to the house...
Yeah...
Yeah, but not now... These will all make it... guaranteed.
No. It's just my job to find him.  I was in the hospital after Garrett Jacob Hobbs.
...after a while.
Stuart is fine.
I want you to help me, Dr. Lecktor.
I thought you might be curious to find our if you're smarter than the person I'm looking for.
You should, Will. God's terrific!  He dropped a church roof on thirty- four of His worshippers in Texas last Wednesday night. Just as they were groveling to Him and singing a hymn.  Don't you think that felt good?  He wouldn't begrudge you two measly murders.
...commercially prohibited.  Number Twelve shot in liquid Teflon in a copper casing. On impact it all opens up in the target. Expect the recoil. They're hot loads.  Body armor?
Tank you veddy much.
And this is a CLASS ACT!  It's the guys who did the Mary Tyler Moore and Bob Newhart shows!  It takes place in a taxi stand!  And you're gonna be the Fonzie!
I'm not interested.  I want to create my own material.
Hi George!
Yeah, we can have a garage sale. "Hey look, I got a floor lamp and a network TV Special for only fifty cents!"
But George, I like to push the boundaries...
You're BLIND!  There is no envelope anymore!!  It hurts me to say this... but there's only one solution --  I don't want you two to ever work together again.
I wanna go back to work and put on a happy show.  The best show anybody's ever seen!
So who's gonna pay for it?
You know Tony doesn't have that kind of money.
You've got good days and bad days.
Eh, I dunno... Andy.  I'm... thinkin' of letting you go...
Look -- I don't wanna seem insulting.  But... your act is like amateur hour: Singalongs... puppets... playing records...
Sure!  Comedy!  Make jokes about the traffic.  Do impressions.  Maybe a little blue material...
No!  That is NOT an audience!  That is PLASTER!  An audience is people made of flesh!  They -- live and breathe!  Got it?!
But it's only for thirty seconds!
I mean -- uh -- the colors in the sky are so vibrant.  I love this time of day.
Hi... am I late?
No thanks.
Hey, I love movie theater popcorn... but that doesn't mean I have to sit through "On Golden Pond."
Gosh.  Gee, Lynne... I was just so impressed with your wrestling moves.
If you want...
They don't know... they've gotta run more tests.
Then your father's a wimp.
Oh George, this is Bob Zmuda.  Bob and I have been buddies for years.
No!  Andy, don't do it --
What is this, World War Two...?
No offense, pal, but I just don't think you're built for it.  These he- men'll kick your ass!!  They're huge!
And you say, "Santa, what am I gettin' for Christmas?"  And he says, "Cancer!"
The wrestling... the sexist remarks... the foul language... these things are not becoming of an enlightened individual.  It seems you have no respect for anything.
It is apparently not working.
Eh, sure.  We're trying to expand our audience base -- and I know the college kids really love Andy Kaufman.
I don't know what yer talkin' about. You musta talked to someone else --
I don't know nothin' about no Kaufman.  He's been ridin' my coattails, smearing my reputation. Been usin' my good name, to get places.
Yeah!  You stay away from that Andy Kaufman, if you know what's good for you!
Isn't Tony Clifton going on Taxi soon?  Maybe that'll chill him out.
Wow, you can't BUY this kind of publicity!
And you are?
We're going to kill him.  Do you understand that?  He's going to die just like the others.
If you have something to say, I suggest you say it to Morpheus.
Hear what?
Morpheus will take him when he's ready.
He's going to pop!
I got you.
Go.
Shit!  Apoc?
They'll be able to track it.
Five minutes.  Maybe six.
Hello, Neo.  Do you know who this is?
Yes.
What do you know?
Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
The Matrix?
You've never used them before.
What is real?  How do you define real?  If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
A.I.?  You mean artificial intelligence?
I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo.  I just said that it would be the truth.
Because... I didn't think I would?
What -- what lesson?
She is a true psychic.  She sees beyond the relativity of time.  For her there is no past, present or future.  There is only what is.
That I would find the One.
Morpheus, I don't know --
Bingo.  Not quite what you were expecting, right?  I got to say I love seeing you non-believers. Always a pip.  Almost done.  Smell good, don't they?
I'd ask you to sit down, but you're not going to anyway.  And don't worry about the vase.
How did you know...?
Who?
Honestly?  I don't know.
How do you know that name?
They're watching you, Neo.
Please.  Just listen.  I know why you're here, Neo.  I know why you left your family and your friends, why you left your home to come to this city.  You're looking for him.
It's going into replication.
... right as rain.
Nothing.  Just had a little deja vu.
A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.  It happens when they change something.
We can't leave him!
I believe I can bring him back.
It wasn't fast enough.
I'm fine.  Come on, we have to keep moving.
Guns.  Lots of guns.
He's alive.
You're not far from Cypher.
I'll be all right.
Hey!  You want good stuff, or you want shit?
Anybody wanna have a game?
Take it easy.  I only asked because maybe I could, you know, let you have a little something.
Giovanino!  Where have you been?
Charlie, I swear on my mother, you're not going to believe this.
All right, forget it.  Tony, you got anything we can put on his face?
Wouldn't bother me.
I could have told you that.
I understand.
He'd rather have the loan payed, you know that.
I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me...
OK, get in.
Ok...that's it.
C'mon Johnny.
Yeah, thanks, it's ok.
'But I say to you, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who persecute...'
'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away!
You're not going to use that gun, Johnny.
I know.
That's nice.
Our friend, Groppi, went to his mother's house.  And when he was there...at night...
Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth...  ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning?  Heming?
Oh yeah, that's a possibility.
What was it?
No, c'mon...Y'know, I read.
What is it now?
A paper on that one too?
I know you don't.  You've been very preoccupied lately.
You're intolerable today.
Uhuh...probably a good idea.  Why don't you do it this time?
But...
Which one, the big tab or the little tab?
No...no.  Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car.
You could say that.
Not bad.  $20.  Here, $5.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Not much more.  Big day in the big city.  What's on your mind?
No.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
We've got some things to discuss.
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
Yeah?  And what about my enemies?
Okay.  All aboard - New York, New York!
No jocks?  A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion?  Someone I could talk to.  Or would talk to me.
But what?
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
You mean this, sir?
How would you like that, sir?  On some kind of toast?
Hi.
What 'business'?
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
What'd it say?
'Yes' to the deal?
Do you think I need a haircut?
How nice for you both.
For how long?  And why?
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
I'm just giving you the truth.  There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Certainly, Bill.
You get not to go to jail.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
'It's up to Joe', huh?
Can, mistah.  Take me to dat nex' place.
Make it time.
Doctor?  What could be wrong wit' you?
Schoolboy tings is you head. Badness for you, badness for her, badness for me, lyin' here tumor, big as breadfruit, poison my inners an' waiting.
Sure.
Are you?
Do you love Drew?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
Yes?
Goodnight to you, Susan.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
Then why are you here, Joe?
Watch me do what?
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Yes.
Not now.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
I don't know.
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you.  But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
To bed.
It was everything.
I love you in an evening gown.
It's a saying.
Thank you.  Would you like the man's name?
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
'Feeling'?  I feel fine.  How do you feel?
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill.  You'll ruin the good start we had last night.  I felt as if I were being treated like a person.  'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
What do you mean?
Of course.
Can you keep a secret?
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be.  A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it.  And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
'Fish'?
I'm sorry to hear that.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me.  So watch it...Bill.
Yes?
I was just asking, Bill.
With you?!  Who is 'you'?  Did you tell her who you are?
Get him in here.
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
'...Yes --'
Death!
You fill the bill, Bill.
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family.  And that's what we're doing.  It's not open for discussion.  Nothing is.  Don't you understand?
Of course.
'Yes' is the answer to your question.
What you were talking about.
I'm here.
Time.
In return you'll receive minuets, days, weeks, I'm not going to go into details ... what matters is that I stay interested.
Yes, Bill.  The question.
Good morning, Quince.
You think Drew will go for it?
Sorry, Bill, have a drink, eat your cake, blow out the candles and make a wish.  Talk to you Monday.  Okay?
But we want you back, Bill.  Mean- while, enjoy your party, celebrate, we'll attend to the nasty details. And Mr. Black, may we say thank you.
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
So what's wrong with that?
Don't get dirty, Dad --
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
I know.  But I'm the only father you've got.
Nothing.
Yer damn right.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
Joe?
I'm sorry.
Oh, yes --
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
I agree --
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
I think I know her.
No. Just leave the stuff lying around as if it were yours. Like you just took it off or something.
I'm sorry... um... ?
I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone.
Seen you together, that's all.
Hi, Leonard.
Leonard.
That's right I did, didn't I?
Interested in buying one?
Don't say anything else.
Yes.
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Tell me about her again.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Where is he?
Yeah?
I told him about your car.
Somebody's come. Already.
Don't protect him.
Get rid of Dodd for me.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
* John G. was clever. He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap that he'd hit me with. He left my gun and left the getaway car. He gave the police a complete package. They found a sap with my blood on it in the dead man's hand, and they only found my gun. They didn't need to look for anyone else. I was the only guy who disagreed with the facts, and I had brain damage.						 *
Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown -
Thank you.
Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name.
That's who you were, you don't know who you are.
John Gammell?
So I see. It's good to see you. My name's Teddy.
You don't have to remember to be hungry.
Just for revenge. That's what keeps me going. It's all I have.
Probably left it in your room.
She's involved with these drug dealers.
So in your grief you wandered into a Jaguar dealership?
That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was.
I'm a snitch. He's a cop from out of town looking for information. The local boys put us in touch.
There's a guy in here, hurt bad! We gotta get him to a doctor!
That, and your thing.						   *
You tell everyone about Sammy. Everyone who'll listen. "Remember Sammy Jankis, remember Sammy Jankis". Great story. Gets better every time you tell it. So you lie to yourself to be happy. Nothing wrong with that - we all do. Who cares if there's a few little things you'd rather not remember?
Are you sure?
You can't just take it!
Why would I have a gun?
His name's James F. Grantz, John G. Check		   * your tattoos.							 *
Grieve elsewhere.
So what's gonna persuade Montoya to change off Sal Maguda running his deliveries...?
There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...
Recruit us to do what?
They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment...
Safe house is empty...  Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina?
You said Nazi Low-riders...?
Meth precursors and the Dutch party favors are en route.
25% discount on the load.
Really?  So, what is this, a party?
You do.
Okay.
Havana.
Are you afraid?  Good.  And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too...  ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel...  And I can do anything I want...
Cost less.  That's the point.
What do you mean?
Zero risk.
I would say you're...  ...four percentage points away from a deal...
Hola, viejo.
Do I need it?
This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you.
I'll be on board by noon.
No.
Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat.
'Cause she will tell you.
"No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall."
Five minutes...
It's in the suburbs outside Havana.
Too fast.  Too many moving parts.
What's your Miami PD badge number?
Okay.  What's up?
NLR, we think.  I wanna know...
We don't know.
Sonny...?
I don't understand...
Haitian, Dominican, Russian, Israeli?
...what else, what else did he indicate to you?  I need to know everything he said.
We don't know.  And that's the point.  Maybe there's a mole. Whatever, it's a disaster.  And it's a Joint Interagency Task Force.  I have DEA, ATF, U.S. Customs components in on it.  So the penetration could be from any one agency.  What we do know is I have to suspend operations right now from undercover work through interdictions 'cause I have to assume our Operational Security is blown.
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily.  He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever.  Life is dust, make it while you can.  He's ambitious.
Slow and low, Adam A-500s...  ...carbon composite, stealthy, 1400 nautical-mile range, thousand ki payload...all the way to Caravels and 727's from a source country to a transshipment point.  Small freighters.  We've done containers...
I had to lay eyes on you.
It is.  He try to take tonight's load?
Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal...
Alonzo...
Said, a person's gotta make a living.
Funny thing, you mentioning money. I was just about to ask your for some...
Lotta rich women back there...
Well, ain't no use hanging around here.
I got me two hundred twenty-four bucks of flat folding money...  He know what he can do with that chicken-shit day's pay. And if he ain't man enough to do it for himself, I be happy to oblige!
Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
What? It's a perfectly good word, ain't it. How much time I got?  Goddam sand thing drive you crazy. Kee-rist. Spelling never was a very strong point with me. Even in school.
M-O-N-Y -- I'm right! That's just exactly how they spell it up there on that big building, bet you could see it from here. M-O-N-Y.
For money for what?
Ten, ten -- I got a twenty -- take that...
Not a cent, I swear to God, I swear on my mother's eyes.
I'm inviting you. I mean if you're not located, I got a place. I'm inviting you, goddamit.
Whatsa matter now?
What's that supposed to mean?
So you could sleep! I mean Christ!
Well now, Ratso, I'm gonna tell you something for your own good, only first gimme a cigarette.
So if you want me to hang around for a few days, I thought you should know.
This is an okay setup you got here, but I'd say you ain't just exactly, uh, flush, is that right or not?
I think finding you's the smartest thing I ever did, for both of us. You just the crooked kinda sneaky little sidewinder I need to get me hustling in this town. Hey!
He can't read. Even dumber than you. Couldn't write his own name. X -- that's what it ought to say there on that goddam headstone. One big lousy X like our flat. Condemned. By order of City Hall.
No. But while you was buying the underwear, I could have lifted the socks.
I'm wet.
Here I am going to Florida and my leg hurts, my butt hurts, my chest hurts, my face hurts, and like that ain't enough, I gotta pee all over myself.
Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
Oh, difficult, it's so difficult. You're a nice person, Joe -- I should never have asked you up -- a lovely person. Oh, how I loathe life. I loathe it. Please go. Please.
This is terrible. I meet someone who -- then -- wait, I want to give you a present. For your trip. You'll let me please...
You bet I do, sir.
Well, not too, I mean, a little.
Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts.
...He had a bald skull and...
Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA? This is Turkey, man... ) It's a fucking accident here if you're innocent. And anyway... ...ain't nobody who's innocent.
Stop shitting me, man!
Shit.
...Don't worry about it.  I can punch you in the nose later. Right now we've got to get you out of here.  You all right?
The Hilton.
About ten kilometers.
Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes?
Beats working.
About as good as it looks.
He wasn't even in the car?
Yeah.
After we're outside the kogus?
I know where it is.
Yeah? Where?
My passport!
Take it off! Take it off!  ...S'il vous plait?...
Was..  ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn.
Mr. Yesil.
Selling your sould for a fistful of carbohydrates...
Yeah...?
...should know better'n to go sneakin' around my turf...
No, you talkin' at me.
Oh, Jesus!!
Oh, you helped me here, all right, white boy.  You and your goddam memo. You needed to prove your point, uh?
Third rail is dead.  Get me up.  There must be a manual override in the booth.
Hey, hey!! Take it easy!!
Hell, I might be able to juice the whole area, if I can get to the power box. It's just a couple of cables...
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
Across both tracks!!
But it look like a man. It... I saw it.
Manny...
Okay. So you lost a great specimen-
Maybe they lied to you.
So?
No such thing, baby.
I was just late.
Yeah, barely. We haven't found anything down here. Nothing...
Toss the flare down!
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
The scent won't last...
You the bug lady, right?
She used a baster.
What is it?
No shit.
What?
I know. It's so upsetting. I'm his number-one fan...I've got all his books, every sentence he ever put down. I'm so proud of my Paul Sheldon collection...  ...here I am, prattling on and my manners have just flown away. I haven't invited you in. Please.
I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way...
Following me?
I didn't know it was going to be a big storm.
Nothing.
The swearing, Paul.  There, I said it.
My daughter must be going nuts.
My pleasure.
She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is...
Yeah, thanks.
Perfect.
Show me the way?
You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists.
Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room.
Oh, but Paul!  I don't think, I know! Now that you've gotten rid of that nasty manuscript, you can go back to doing what you're great at--  --you're going to write a new novel-- your greatest achievement ever-- Misery's Return.
C'mere, I'll show you.
I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written.
I want my pain to go 'way, Annie-- make it go 'way, please Annie--  --please...
The what?
Why would you lose me?
It is.
No, I haven't.
Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you?
Be my guest.
Maybe.
You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things.
Dome Pear-igg-non it is.
Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office.
He might well be. But not the way they say. He didn't crawl out of that car by himself. You saw those dents on the door--someone pulled him out.
Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer?
No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary?
I'm sure you're right.
We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days.
Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy.
It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character.
Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million.
Paul, since you brought her up, I have to ask you this, or I'd be drummed out of the agents' union-- what about a non-fiction book? The truth about what went on in that house.
How do you that.
Oh, I am.  Later..
Only because..it's spring..chalk it up  - to spring fever.
Maybe that's it, then.  Everything's upside down and backwards...
To do what?
Not going in from the ground.  Show me the atrium.
You know, that was the hardest part of having to portray you.  Grinning like an idiot every fifteen minutes.
Why, you going to make me a better offer?
A myth..just a myth...shouldn't you be checking out their countersurveillance?
Right.
How much longer before you can reach him?
He should've have killed the virus in the incubation area..Nyah's exited the elevator on the same level as the lab.
No.  Just as if I'd like to.
What if I pay the rent?
Think you're the only one who can pick a lock?
Indeed.
At least you walked.
Not really.  I triggered the alarm..
Oh bloody hell.  You're a spy.
Ethan Hunt.
Not revealing information doesn't necessarily make someone a liar.
Which is?
This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much.
Just like old times.
Just about..
Bids from possible Chimera buyers -- to prove that as of the date on the newspaper those bids are back up by earnest money --
Why?  What's happened. What did you see?
No time to explain.  You've done well, and we're so close.  So close.  It's critical that you do whatever Ambrose asks.  Don't worry - it'll be over soon.. That's a promise.. Come on, now off you go!
Why did you phrase it like that?
'You're sorry and I'm sorry.'
Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich is dead.  So is his colleague, Gradski, but that happened earlier.  We had Nekhorvich on a flight from Sydney that crashed in the Rockies..
You were there.
In any case, you've got to recover Chimera and bring it to us.
Well you know Nekhorvich's history. You're the one who got him out of the Soviet Union was it still in bio- weapon business.
Miss Hall and Ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously.  She walked away and he's wanting her back ever since.  We believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.
Well, then I mislead you.  Or you made the wrong assumption.  Either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.
You'd like me to conduct my own debriefing.
I'd thank you -- but I'm not sure that was a compliment.
In this case, it wasn't a bad idea.  In face, it was a pretty damn good idea. Just don't make a habit of it.  And, as for Ms. Hall, in light of her efforts, her criminal records will certainly be expunged.  I'm assuming you approve.
That simple, huh?
Left jacket pocket?
No garage entrance.  Lobby's protected by five guards on rotating patrol.
You know, I think it's a little late for that.  Do give my regards to Gradski if you see him.
Yes, Anatoly, yes.
So what do you suggest?
S.O.P..
And if we donít find him - weíll search the whole train again.
May take a little time.
If you're gonna do this again Claire, It's not gonna be on my watch.
I wasn't.  I heard that Jim was in trouble on the radio.  He said someone was...
Take off your coat.
Take off your God damn coat!
No one sent me!  We're supposed to be back here at four o'clock, four o'clock, if we abort, we don't return here until four o'clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o'clock --!
I'm going to get it for him.  Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.
Sure...
You didn't have to.........
Kittridge is Job.  Max delivered.  How far is he from Luther?
Theyíre dead.
One hour.
Yeah.
Of IMF agents.  At the Embassy.  Tonight.
Let's see if you can follow me around this room.  The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team.  You're worried about me. <u>Why</u>?
I don't know, Ethan. Suppose you tell me?
Well my Mother was a little confused about how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope smugglers in the Florida keys.
That depends.
Whether you like a paradox.  I want a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
Like Job?
Tell you what.  How good's the RF scanner you used in the car?
I don't have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession -- like a warm blanket.  My deal with Job was subject to a successful boot scan.  Obviously it didn't pass muster.  Deal's off.
It doesnít, dear girl.  as long as you tell me where the money is.
Bank?
We're not outta here yet.
Just waiting for you, tubs.
Just don't chew it.
Higher.
Jim.  Jim.  Heís in the open.
Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.
If Max doesn't like what you have to say, you'll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.
What the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? Claire's in a weird mood too.
Ethan, you <u>can't</u> burn out.
He's our guy.
Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
I can sit up straight.  I just can't..sit up straight very well.  It's not important!  I saw who shot me.  Ethan, I saw the mole.  It was Kittridge.  <i>Kittridge!</i>
We donít have to, Jim.  Heíll come after us.
What he didnít get in Prague.  The NOC list.
Youíre probably right.
And get a doctor.
Keep counting Claire.
Ethan - Iíve always taught you, nothing can be more dangerous than the truth.  It can kill you.
I don't know.
Doesn't mean it's a signal.  Could just be the hard drive heating up.
Twenty minutes.
Connection denied.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
I'm going to bed now.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
Bed.
Again?
I didn't give you away the first time.
What'd you do to your hair?
Alright. I didn't see you here.
And what did they say?
Let me come and talk to you.
Yes. Do you want...
Excuse me.
He knew my husband who died.
Yesterday.
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
I've never seen a moon like that.
Don't just become excited.
What did you do?
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
That's right.
Good! We can get this out on the table.  I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother. 
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
You? No.
No?
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
I shouldn't.
Bobo, take the cart away.
This is a good suit.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
And who's gonna pay for that?
No.
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Where's pop?
No more he's not.
She recovered.
You gotta date?
What sins have you to confess?
I will. But I must find the right moment.
I came right from the airport.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
Where is she?
You're kidding?
You don't know where Loretta is?
Definitely!
I'm not disturbed. By you.
None of your business.
I think it's because they fear death.
I'm too old for you.
Sure.
You mean the whole house?
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
You were a tiger last night.
And what do you burn, apart from witches?
Not at all.  They could be carried.
Well, it doesn't matter.   Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
He knows of a cave ... a cave which no man has entered.
But the Grail ... where is the Grail!?
The Britons.
I am your king!
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held Excalibur aloft from the bosom of the water to signify by Divine Providence ...  that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur ... That is why I am your king! | |                              OLD WOMAN |      Is Frank in?  He'd be able to deal with this one. | DENNIS Look,  strange women lying on their backs in ponds handing out swords ... that's no basis for a system of government.  Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.
We want ... a shrubbery!
We are now no longer the Knights Who Say Ni!
Oh, please!
Had enough?
Course I have.
You'll what ... ?
Come, Patsy.
I'm French.  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king.
I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.
Er ... We ... Launcelot, Galahad, and I ... Er ...  leap out of the rabbit and ...
No!  Not the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
Just keep me covered.
It's the ... oh ...  it's the ... it's on the tip of my tongue ...
Yes, my liege.  Stand by for attack!!
Oh, just some friends!
There are some who call me Tim?
Greetings King Arthur.
How shall we find this cave, O Tim?
Who did we lose?
Man!
I'm thirty-seven.
Well ... I AM king.
Yes, I see.
Be quiet!  I order you to shut up.
Shut up!
Well, don't. |      I really don't know where all this got started. It's like those miserable psalms.  they're so depressing. Now knock it of
If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.
My name is Sir Launcelot.
What is your quest?
What is the capital of Assyria?
I think I could pull through, sir.
Farewell, Concorde!
You even kicked the bride in the chest!  It's going to cost me a fortune!
Is it?
But, Mother ...
Shut your noise, you,  and get that suit on!
Well ... I'll tell you ...
... and you'll come and get him.
No ....  keep him in here ... and make sure he doesn't ...
What?
Oh yes, of course!  I thought you meant him!  You know it seemed a bit daft me havin' to guard him when he's a guard ...
Yes.  It's not a very good name, is it?  But we are nice and we shall attend to your every ... every need!
Camelot ...
Why?
No, really, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily!
I don't think I was.
No, no, we must find the Grail.
You got my note!
I knew that someone would come.  I knew ... somewhere out there ... there must be ...
No, no, no.
Not down south you don't.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
You know what I mean.
The good-looking one.
I've got my duties to attend to.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Mary Taylor, sir.
I hope to go up next year.
Mr Brown, sir --
Yeah, yeah, I did.
Yeah.
A situation?
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
And that is my last word on the matter.
How will I know?
That's not good enough.
You will await your orders like everyone else.  Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard.  In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
I am a blank sheet.
Quite.
I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
It's nothing.
I'm not married.
I do what I do.
Yes, ma'am.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
I heard something.
Aye.  But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Yes?
I'm breaking no promises!
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
Then why send me back to them?!
Not at all, Dean.  Good of you to spare the time.
You can't know that for sure.
Who?
Of course.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it.  Lucky.
No, indeed.
Whom?
Cold is good!
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
I understand he was in a fight.
No.  I shall be out walking.
I have no idea.
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am.
You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral.
Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.
How do you do that?
What the hell are you talking about?
Greg never came home.  A few hours is one thing, Nick, but this is different. Something's happened to him.
It doesn't necessarily mean she's...
My house.  I want to try something.
Nick, what is it.
...but then it hits the relay stations...
No I'm not...
I can't believe you made it!
Screamer.
I am The Liar.  Where should I take you?
Give her a chance, will you?
I'm going home.
I'm going home Cynthia.
I'm going home. I'll call you later.
There is no problem.
I agree with what you said...truly.
I'm sorry Mr. Kesher, but there seems to be some problem concerning your credit card.
That's fine, Mr. Kesher. You can pay cash when you check out. I'm sorry. it was my duty to inform you.
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler.  Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Well then, take a seat everyone. Betty why don't you join Jimmy and we'll play the scene. Is there anything you'd like to say Bob... something to Betty before they begin?
No. I can't.
Oh...
But, this could be serious.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
Good luck!
What is it? What do you see?!
Do you know them?!
Keep going. Go around to the back.
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
And who are we auditioning for today?
And do we know which of the fifty-seven buildings Wally Brown is in?
Well, now we've got to figure that out first don't we?
Mr.Wallace Brown is in the Executive Building on the second floor. We want to go in and turn right at the first street. Then we want to walk three blocks down past Stage 17 to the white Executive Building. Once we're on the second floor the receptionist will take us from there. Now do we have name?
Gotta keep an eye on her, that's all.
I just wanted to come here.
This Denny's.
Okay, so you had a dream about this place. Tell me.
Find out who they are?
Where at?
Damn, that's a long drive.
Making ends meet, huh.
Yeah, look at my digs ... times are tough.
Not a coke or anything?
Great.. great. Is there any kind of hint or anything ?
What's going on ?
No time. Get him up.
Leave him, he's dead.
Knows ? He watches every "Guest" on tape. This whole place is here for his sick amusement. And no so are we.
Once the room depletes it's oxygen, we have about 30 seconds, then a door opens on the bottom over there. Then we swim out.
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
You don't. It's random, there no trick.
It's poison gas, this is the antidote. Drink it.
It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
I work here, remember ?
43 unpaid parking tickets, sir.
I don't help criminals.
Let's just see if he can make it into round two....
Yes, sir Mom. 
You've got it boss. One more mangled body to the East River, coming up !
Here. Am I ever going to get to run the controls for one these capers ?
Look, you're going to have to start trusting me sometime. I am a trustworthy person.
That's right. Now who needs to trust who ? Trust me, when you're ready to work the controls, I'll put you in the hot seat.
Matthew lives on the Upper West Side, kinda posh for a temp don't you think ?
Checking........
Not that well sir. I believe we have a few too many soft hearts in the building. Did we aquire a bank from Chicago or a charity ?
I am thirty two.
Bruce may still refuse. It is my belief that he is becoming more belligerent.
What then sir ? What would we do with the park with out Bruce ?
John, sir.
Fantastic ! A little faster sweetheart.
What are you looking for ? A blow job ?
Then what do you want ?
What ?????
I don't know.....
I have a turn for the worse for the team !
I can see that but where ?
Go in there ? What if Bruce finds you ?
Thank you.
Yes.
Yes, Excuse me for a second.
Which one, this door is locked !
We just having our first date when you showed up.
I'm fine.
Humph, meee?? My dear, this is not a country that rewards poetry, this is a country that rewards gas mileage, besides, people don't read poetry anymore, they watch television. Don't be a poet, be a TV repairman.
Well if I was looking for a victim, I definitely wouldn't pick your Uncle Phil who outweighs me by about 150 pounds, besides, who would I ask for ransom? You??
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
Great.
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste.  Hey Cece!
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
Thanks, I needed that.
Hi Dad.
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
You're being narrow-minded.
Maybe he's hungry.
Maggie Muldovan? Did you...know her?
I'll try.
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, &quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget.&quot; We never did.
I've got something better.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Come on in!
It's just a corpse.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Then I have come to the right place.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
You would.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
In the tar??
Owh...
This is a totally barbaric custom.
And you'd be my cousin?
Good. I mean...
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
Rose this not the place to be having this...
They're great.
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed.
This is it I guess.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
You know how I feel about you.
Bye Niece, Vada.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
Yes, I do.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
You have no idea.
O.K.
Vada!!
I like to buy off all the railroads.
No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your head up. Don't look at the ball, look at me.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
My __EX__ wife seems to have ripped off my camper.
Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in your throat.
Pardon?
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
I prefer it to &quot;instead&quot;, it has more dignity.
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
Did she ever see Vada?
Goodnight.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Is it really your camper?
Pointing upwards Look...
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Then who's it for?
What?
No, sweetie, not yet.
Feeding my fish.
He was allergic to bees.
What??
Are you sure about all this?
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
Hi, is Vada home?
Thank you. Bye.
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
I wrote a poem too.
Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he seems like the old Harry.
Yes it is.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
Can I use your bathroom first?
Come here, sit down.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
Uh huh.
No.
What?
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
I am not.
I stopped that!
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Go???
I wanna live with them too.
Really?
Hi Vada, can you come out?
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
Like they do on TV?
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
Umm, Ummmmm
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
Part of being a New Yorker.
... weeks.
Kindred spirits.
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
I have a suggestion...
You have a real philosophy of life.
I can see why.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
The man you love.
I wish.
Try less appropriate.
I can't even say it.
What do you suggest?
It's too late to start over.
Major.  Dish.
Oh, you're more than okay.
Well, we're...
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
... you hate weddings, you never go.
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
... that this is all my fault?
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
Dance?  You don't dance!  You learn to dance??
Hate that.
She admires.  Tommy Lasorda.
Firenze.
Hey, cabs are expensive.  I'm cheap, remember?
Boy, those were the days.
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Like I said, dazzling.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
Have you.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
Well.
Me, too.  I'm getting married tomorrow.
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
A bad combination.
Shhh.
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
I travel every week.  College ball, motor sports, training camps...
... and you knew about this.
What is that sup...
Right here.
Well, that just happened that time.
You got a real good memory, Star.
Grand Old Opera --
I won first prize.
Yes. I'm cutting a record.
What?
You're so good.
I'm really all right, Barnett. Don't you worry really... I just don't want you to leave me that's all.
Eater  says she doesn't see how you do it.
I'll go on. Ester'1l be very glad.
You get her those Vitamin E right away.
Okay. Thanks.
Barnett, John Triplette. How's she doing?
Haven? Hell,' we've been playing poker together since we were fourteen.
He knows better.
They can come to the concert in the park.
Absolutely. Listen, Barnett, I understand your position.
Nothing; Barnett. It's my job.
Who the hell is he?
What does he want?
I don't care. She's always been neutral in politics and that's not going to change.
Oh, no, listen, I don't want to take up too much of your time.
Sure thing.
Okay.
When is it?
Not yet.
Haven Hamilton is your father? Can you arrange an interview?
What is a turkey shoot.
Your wire Ester - she passed away.
Oh... a little of both. Just thought I'd look around at Nashville for a while.
A little. What do you need?
Replacement party.
A guy named Walker. Amazing person. He's developed a huge following.
I'm in a hurry, gonna see this great group record at Woodland.
No.
Nash.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
When I was little, in church.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
He's a member of our congregation.
What do you mean?  You said you wanted to see me.
Who is this, right?  I called you last night.
I have to go.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
What...?  0h, yes.
Yea.
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Eight-thirty in the chapel.
Hundreds of times.
Thanks. You are just a wonderful person.
You're doing some recording here, aren't you?
Mary?
Do they have a show to give it to you?
Do you study at all?
Where is she?
We're connected by a relative. One time, one of his aunts married one of my uncles. That was a long time ago, though. How'd you come to work for him?
I never heard of him. Name somebody else.
I'll be damned. Boy, if you could get Ryan to say something about Hal Phillip Walker, wouldn't that be something?
I'll be dammed.
Sure thing.
More or less...
Yes you are.
Tim studied several styles, but his favorite was Jeet Kune Do.
What...
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
Are we in a big hurry?
Well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. And since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.
What's changed, Mr. Gayle, is our minds. We felt they were competent a year ago. A year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.
Now that you bring it up, yes. They were different men. I hadn't really thought that much about it. Since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. What do you think normally happens? The Knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? The state doesn't work like that.
Mickey's better half herself. Mallory Knox. This little lady drowned her father in a fish tank.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
Don't worry about it.
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
No.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
Yes.
No fuckin' way! No fuckin' way!
No fuckin' way!
Then you've seen the scene where Arnold Schwartzenegger is talking to Lou Ferigno.
Unfortunately, yes.
Yes.
Survival of the fittest.
Capt'n!
That dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.
So you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
Perfecto!
Super cool.  This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
They got a asshole over here.  A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there.  A asshole perched up there.  Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this...  ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
Lose 'em.
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle.  Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want.  But seriously, Phil, look at this.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Don't call my men assholes.
They pay you three bucks a day an' all the cotton you can eat.
Out.
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
That's right.
What d'you think?
You' new here, man!  See you, boys.
What did you say your name is?
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Oh yeah? That's good.
Yeah. On the section gang.
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
No.
That's right.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
You almost got into trouble back there.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
I thought you wasn't comin'.
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
Don't call them that.
He could live with us.
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
You jivin' me?
We'll be all right.
What about your boy?
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
Don't ask, baby - huh!  How much money you got with you?
What the hell could you do?
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
Like what?
You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
Sorry.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
I said, she's in great shape.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
That's right.
Okay.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
Is that right?  Think you're gonna make it with her?
Hi.
Nothin'.  She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more.  Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies.  You got some money?
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
Okay, boy, beat it.
Anything you say, baby.
You hate Raoul?
Don't give her the satisfaction.  Your wife is on her way...
I'm still on my honeymoon.
I'm fine.
Of course.
He wants to kill you, you know... Perhaps I won't allow it.
Of course...
The Elders, mon...
A place to tap in. I can scramble that signal before this place is crawling with guardsmen.
They're only guessing, but we can't take any risks.
How's the villa's security?
You son-of-a-bitch, you're crazy.
Put the Sense/Net Police on it. The matrix is their turf.
First, let's get something straight. We ran a psych construct on you that lists self destruction as your favourite pastime. If you want to kill yourself, Mr. Case, there's much more entertaining ways than working for me.
Questions make me nervous. Part of our arrangement will be that you don't ask too many.
The disturbance in cyberspace... It's an A.I.
This one's different. No one can trace it. It's out there somewhere in the matrix and it's growing stronger... infecting other computer systems like a virus.
It hasn't yet.
I've arranged for him to work with us.
I know.  You ever work with ghosts, Case?
You'll be ready for a trial run in two days. If your splices hold, you'll use McCoy to trace the A.I.'s coordinates.
What about McCoy?
Offworld. The A.I.... this "Wintermute" thing evolved on a computer mainframe on the satellite Freeside. If you attack it from within the matrix while Molly accesses its original programming we can cripple its defence systems.
You'll be linked during the entire operation.
This ain't Bangkok, chief.
The words?
I don't have a girl.
That's a good question. What's the last thing you remember?
Dixie, you know how a ROM construct works?
Okay, Dix. You _are_ a ROM construct.
I an' I, man. I an' I.
Can you walk?
No problem, amigo.
When we're done, erase this friggin' tape.
That's pretty good cause he's only working with one lobe.
So it does business through a brain dead marine and runs the stock market for funding. That means Wintermute hired us to fry itself. It doesn't make sense.
No. It's gotta be more than that. That hard wiring also keeps it from getting too smart. Too powerful.
I'll let it access me. That'll give you a free shot. Make it a good one. Dix.
Don't worry, Dix. I'm on a roll.
No!... No...
People are talking. They say the Yakuza has a contract out on you.
Too many places. You're playing tag wish some kind of death wish, Case.  I'm sorry but I'm not sticking around for the funeral.
I don't know. I don't know...
I'm gonna burn you to the ground, you son of a bitch.
Shut down your ice patterns. I'll take you out.
What's my end?
For someone else. Bodyguard. Courier... Whatever.
Too late?
Put the gun down, Case.
Yeah... Yeah, I'm fine.
Something exotic I hope.
No. It's important to be able to feel those things.  We're going to pull this run off, Molly, and we've got to do it soon.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
Nice.
Oh I know.
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
Thanks.
Yeah, I know.
Exactly.
Right. 7:30.
Nope.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
We used it for our expose on overweight flight attendants--"Is That Why They Never Give You a Second Bag of Nuts?"
Can I just say--I totally love Ex- Lax.
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Betty.
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
Five-- Six--
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
Oh. Right.
Kristen got a quote?
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Dude, you rock!
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
No. Josie, this is real.
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
Really?
Not the happiest of souls.  "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
College. Haven't really thought about it.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
You remember that story?
Why do you do that?
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
Yeah, I have.
You were attracted to me?
Wait, I was going to tell you--
I finally found my story.
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
Well, a ball player.
Rob, I mean it. I want you to be my first. Me and you. Once the floor stops spinning, let's have sex.
Everybody knows about--
And heavy...
Where?
He stayed a long time.
<i>                      -- A box? --        Is it steel? --                     Are there locks? -- Is it filled with a pox? --                          A pox! -- How delightful, a pox!</i>
<i>                      -- It's a bat. --              Will it bend? -- It's a rat. --              Will it break? -- Perhaps it's the head that I found in the lake.</i>
<i>                      You're so stupid, think now -- If we blow him up to smithereens, We may lose some pieces and then Jack will beat us black and green.</i>
It's getting there.
Oh, come on Dad...
What are you talking about?
What about it?
She's a neighbor, I drive her to school.
You got a problem with me, Grady?
Yeah, why?
What the hell are you talking about?
It was okay.
Yeah, well, Schneider's got a stick up his ass today.
He must've been working late and some fruitcake came in and sliced him up like a kielbasa.  In the shower!  Left bloody footprints all over the...
Look at this car.  Are you kidding?
Who, Grady?  Grady's alright, he's just a hothead.
Yeah.
Wow...
I don't know.  Where are we going?
What's this?
My Dad thinks I'm on drugs, my Mom thinks I'm crazy and I'm not sure I don't agree with her.
Why won't you talk to me?
I can't!
Sure...go ahead.
How'd you sleep, honey, okay?
All of them.
We're going to bed.
Hi Mom.
It's okay, I'm not tired.  Really.
They're healing up nicely.
Research.
No, she's right.
When I was a little girl.  Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better.  He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
I was on the team at school.  I was never very good, though.
You did it the other night.
Those are ancient history.
Fuck off.
Just something children sing...to keep the boogeyman away.
Sounds like a rough time.
I've been to Pittsburgh.  Does that count?
That's a new one.  Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
With Hypnocyl?
Everybody take five.
Anything?
All right.  Whoever she is, I'll admit she seems to know more about Krueger than I do.
Just go.  Kristen needs you.  Keep her awake somehow.  Do it.
Freddy Krueger.  He was a child murderer before he died.  After he died, he became ...something worse.  Six years ago Freddy killed my friends. He almost killed me.  I thought I got rid of him -- but I guess he was too strong.
That girl was Amanda Krueger.  Her child --
You must find the remains...and bury them in hallowed ground.
Don't worry, it won't come to that.
Elizabeth, we don't need any outside help.  I know these kids.  I don't want some hot-shot taking chances with them just so she can get published.
There will be no repeat occurences of last night's events.  From now on, your doors will be locked during sleeping hours.  We'll begin a policy of evening sedation.  For everybody.
For God's sake, Elizabeth...just try to help the kids, will you?  Listen to them.
Uh, fourteen.
Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of...
Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right.
I'm a vegetarian.
Night, night, Honey.
Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up?
Fifteen million dollars.
Eighteen yards.  That's my house there.
No thanks.
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Oh -- Okay.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
Yes.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair.
She left me.
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
Oh no no -- no.
I appreciate that absolutely.  Is that the film you're doing?
My son's name is Johnny?
Well, get a message through to him too.
No.  What's that?
You have a stunt bottom?
Don't ask.
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
Thank you.  Shall I...
What's the thing?
And what would you say...
That's very good news.  The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
Yes.
C'est la vie... We're lucky in lots of ways, but... Surely it's worth a brownie.
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Tony -- what do you think?
No -- it's my 22nd.
Di Caprio.
Well, yes.  Groovy.
William has just turned down Anna Scott.
Well, thanks, that's great.
Good move: when all is said and done, she's nothing special.  I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely glimpsed some cellulite down there.
Oh great.  Could you do me a favour and try to get us some really cold water up here?
Still, not sparkling.
Unless it's illegal in the UK to serve liquids below room temperature: I don't want you going to jail just to satisfy my whims...
And maybe you could just adios the dishes and empty the trash.
I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from.
Ah... yes, enormously.
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Can I help you?
Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
No -- did you?
She's perfect, perfect.
Is it someone we know?
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
I'm sorry, we don't have anyone of that name here, sir.
Thanks.  Great.  Wish me luck.
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
Two?  That's it?
Absolutely not.
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
Right.  Right.  You think it's the wrong moment.  Fair enough.  Do you mind if I have a go?
Okay -- okay.  Might be too late, but okay.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Yes, that's perfectly correct.
Yes, that is correct.
I mean, the other day you made an allusion to my wife and the possible sexual problems we might be having. I know that to be the case, but the way in which you broached it, if that's your idea of teaching me something...
Y-y-y-yes...
I-I-I...
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Who? Tell me!
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
I wanna report a robbery!
Yeah, some creep stole my cigarettes!
Well, say. How 'bout springing a pack of cigarettes loose?
Right!
Go on...
He's into his wind-up. Here's the next pitch... and it's a hit! It's a hit!
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
B-B-Billy.
O-o-o-oh...
W-w-w-what is it, M-M-Mac?
Go ahead! Go back!
M-M-M-Mack?
Are they all crazies?
Wow! They're so quiet.
It's okay, Rose. You can go with him.
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
What for?
Hey, what's that?
Tell 'er to go straight to hell!
My feet hurt...
A pecking party?
Lobotomy?
Now, what would I be trying to say?
Yeah... Okay, stand aside, you guys! You're usin' up my oxygen!
What are you talking about??? Everybody was covered!!! Everybody was covered!!!
No!
I'm not running a charity ward...
What's he talkin' about?
McMurphy killed two attendants and escaped...
Gary Blinker...
Hold it a minute.
Yeah, Mac?
Why, I'll betcha there must be a million albacore and tuna running of the coast right this minute.
I see.
Just fine, Doc... In fact, I think I might've put on a couple of pounds since I got here.
Shoot, Doc, the only one I'm disturbing is that old nurse and her fixed ways. That's all.
'Kay, Mac!
'Kay!
I want you to write me a letter to my brother for a hundred dollars to bury me.
I'm the next one.
Yeah, you don't know how to get outta this place!
Yeah, yeah, you're a fucking phony, McMurphy!
Breakfast! Hell, I know just the place where we can chow down an' thaw out before we shoot back on home. 'Kay?
Sure...
Gimme those dice. I'll blow this board to pieces. Here we go...  Lebenty leben, count me over eleven, Martini...
Okay. Who else?
'Kay...
Yeah, that's a good idea, Turkle. Why don't ya take Rose on a little tour of our facilities...
You an' me, Chief.
No...
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb.  Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
On what?
Why, my head would just squash like an eggplant, McMurphy.
I don't have any.
This way, Mister McMurphy.
After you, ma'am.
Now you talkin'.
Jus' cleanin' up, ma'am.
Ah, no, ma'am... well, yes, ma'am...  A man get awful lonely at night, if ya know what Ah mean, ma'am...
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
No, she wasn't my sister.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
Mr. Bradley left about a half hour ago.  He said his plans had changed unexpectedly.  Would you prefer an interior or exterior room?
I'm very sorry.  Perhaps you misunderstood?
Once they pay the bill, we don't usually follow them.
Why?
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
No.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Exactly.
Except possibly that.
No.
But, Faith--
Dwayne Pinsley?  I'm trying to reach Dwayne Pinsley.
I'm at the airport.  Why?
Well, he'd have to hurry.  My flight leaves at four o'clock.
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
NO.
He's safe.
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way.  Does he  know who you are?
Because.  I know where he is.
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Mickey Spillane?
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
Exactly.  Besides, no hard feelings.  You found somebody.  I found somebody. I thought we could double.
No.  I just came by to apologize.
In that case... no...
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
There is no us.
Tonight?
A few times.  It's kind of an annual tradi--
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
So?...
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
It's a coincidence.
What about your job?
You're coming with me?
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
Only what?
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Nothing.
Her brother.
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
Because I'm the one who's single.
Packing.
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
I know, but...
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
What do the years matter?  I've known you for centuries...
I thank you.
Right.
You used to love it when I called you doll.
If I talk too loud it's the fault of the nuns.
Gimme.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
That was the idea.
He probably gave 'em an argument.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
Maybe.
Don't say that!
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
Okay— I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but— go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
I wish I knew, Edie, But— 
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
A teacher! Dong!!!  You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little—  I better get you home.
In a saloon?
I am?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But— I didn't stay in shape— and—  —I had to take a few dives.
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
I know... I know... .
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
Get away from me.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me.  Charley?
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me.  Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
You always said I was a bum. Well—  —not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights.  Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
He wanted to see me again.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
I don't want to hear it in there.
A question of who rides who.
Good luck.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley— and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom— with the truth as you know it—  Truth is the gun— Drop that thing and tell the truth— a more dangerous weapon than this little —  —cap pistol.
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
Yeah, considerin' they was usin' my head for a baseball!
Are you on the level, Father?
If I stick my neck out, and they chopped it off, would that be the end of it? Or are you ready to go all the way?
Down to the wire?
Well, I had my fun, I've drunk my fill and I tickled some good-lookin' fillies— I'm on borried time.
Wilson— yeah—  yeah— I fought Wilson.
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him— boy, I was ready that night.
Raise a hand to me and... .
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
First things first.
Easy, that new checker faked the receipt. Here it is, boss. 
By way of Chicago?
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
I can't believe it— a small fortune.   You can't buy me— you're still a bum!  'Bye, Edie. Lord have mercy on Joey. 
What are you down here for— to see we don't make off with any of Mister Friendly's precious cargo?
Fiend is it!  You will not be so fortunate.  Your existence will cease within moments.  No one wishes to see a man dance...  And you, my dear, will entertain for centuries to come.
..Oh, You could do nothing!  I can save you much pain.
You wouldn't understand.  Seeing a cemetery on a night like this can stir in the mind the best ideas for a good horror story.
Okay.
I can't imagine anything dead playing that music.
I'm not sure, myself. It's just a feeling I've had since the crash...Like I feel a cold chill all over.. ..Now this!
I don't know.  I just don't know. But don't give up. We're not finished yet.
Be careful!
I'm frightened.  I'm so frightened.
I should hope not.  I hate you!
My old boyfriend Tommy would never have gotten me in a mess like this.  At least <i>he's</i> got brains.
A symbol, Master.
It would seem so, Master.
Ahh, there is yet time.
You mean...!
Is there time?
Well rest easy, I'm not angry with either of you.
Ahh hahahhnnn hahnnn!
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
Who is it?
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
I know a Glenn.
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He didn't want me to.
He'd call every once in a while.
Who are you?
Listen to me.  I'm a good friend of Jack Foley.
She's coming with us.
Get the shotgun.  And her purse.  I'd like to know who she is.
The green-and-whites saw us.  One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there?  Ties it to the break and turns around...
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
Forget about my sister.  If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Let fate decide?  What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Yes, she did.
Yeah, I did.
Half for doing what?
They sure do.
And then they'll kill 'em.
All you gotta do is get in.
Jack --
In the trunk, yeah?
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
And what happened to Carl?
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
Call and tell you.
Wait.  You not Adele?
Oh.  Then this must be Adele...
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
I don't smoke.
Not until recently.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
In my bag, in the car.
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Faye Dunaway.
Peter Finch.
Why?  You think he might tell you where I am?
He's dead.  He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.  That's not gonna be me.
Those guys bother you?
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
You believe that?
Don't talk like that, okay?  You scare me.
I don't know about that.  You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
I see better with them on.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
You know who they are?
I don't know.  I never used a gun.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn.  Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
Of course not.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
Yeah.  That was the ninth.
Hejira.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
Glenn?
We're not.  I'm helping him, yeah--
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Oh, I'm here, all right.  I'm very here. Question is, why aren't <u>you</u> here?
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how.  We the experts.
No.  You gonna stay close to me from now on.  So you don't disappear on me.
I <i>was</i>...
He said he stayed with Maurice.
Your dog was killed?
Oh, he's moved out?
What're you doing at Glades?
No?
He's pretty laid back, confident.
It's possible.  Why?
That's right, just me.
No.  Course not.
Whoever.  The point is, prices are goin' up, too.  Better get your little black book out, Richard.  We got some business to talk about.
Yeah.  Sure.  It's all settled.
He was that good?
You don't forget love, Honey.  Not ever.
Yeah.  But if I have to get something out, I c-can always s-s-s-  SIIING!
Sir, I --
The one that slept in my mouth last night.
Well, you p-puked on his feet.
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns!  Coma, you cover the cannons!  Joe, Theo, come with us!  Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
Power dive!
Good shooting, Rafe!
The Colonel helped me work it out.
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny.  It's time I made mine.
Yeah.
It's a test.  If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
So what are you saying?
You left her.  How's that for a fact?
Fuck you.
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
Little less.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
No.  You're trying to beat me.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch.  That'll help.
The brass is afraid of sabotage.  This makes 'em easier to protect -- and easier to service.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
Thank you, Sir.
Bombers.
Every other Sunday.  I'm heavyweight champion of the West Virginia.
We're all going away.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
Brilliant, Admiral.
We have a fighter screen up, in case we are attacked, Admiral.
Have the planes made it to China?
Peggy Sue!
I've already got some in. I was thinking of making a pie for dinner tonight.  How would you like that?
Good—bye, Grandma.
Stag movies. Smokers.
It wouldn't be a lodge without hats.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
It's that jerk Walter.
Charlie...
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
I'm not going.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Maybe I blocked it out.
Why wait?
Is this slow enough for you?
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
How'd you know about that?
That's real big of you.
You're going to listen to me.
Right here. Now sit down.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
Of course.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Touchy, touchy!
What, why?
That's a day's work. But if that's what you want, maybe we can do it tomorrow for your birthday.
I wish she hadn't.
It must run in the family.
Come on, where's your enthusiasm?
But I always thought that you would marry Charlie, Carol would marry Walter, and I would marry Arthur. We'd all live on the same street and take our kids to the park together and have barbecues every Sunday. It'll spoil everything if you and Charlie break up. That Michael doesn't look like the barbecue type.
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Doing some shopping?
This morning was good.
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
What about?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
For what?
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
Can I tell Diane that Peggy Sue got drunk or is that a deep family secret?  Well?
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
You have an incredible memory.
But accidents can happen.
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
God damn it Gus, you dug up my wife! What the fuck is going on around here?!
Well we're glad to have you, Marjorie. You can call me Chase, by the way.
He doesn't. I don't know what he has, but I'm hoping to God it's not infectious...
I'll be fine, Dad.
Anywhere but here.
Zowie.
You shouldn't ever say that about your parents, not even your Dad.
Look, if there was even one chance in a million it'd work, wouldn't you want to try?
Yeah...
Maybe it takes a while...
Yes, Bob, I do.  Excuse me? Am I being fired?
I said, don't worry about it.
He's not sorry, okay, fine.  Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy?
I said, "Everyone's going to die, Jimmy. But Drew's not going to die of AIDS. There's a cure around the corner, and he plans to be around to take advantage of it."
Yes. I think it will be a simple solution. They'll put it in a syringe, inject it into your bloodstream. It'll neutralize the virus. It'll revitalize the immune system, and people with AIDS will become healthy again.
Fuck you. This shit's probably not doing me any good anyway.
The least you can do is look at me, while I'm sticking this shit into your arm. Forget the fucking case, one hour a day, and give me a little of your time.
That's not what I said.
That's right. We're on the Positive Plan. You don't have a Fatal Disease, you have Manageable Illness.
I hope you're ready for "Studs," because that's what's on.
More than your friend. Family.
Don't do this, Andy.
I'm seeing him this afternoon.
About my blood work?
Sounds delightful.
Defined by Webster's as harmless.
It's okay. Can I sit down?
As in, the vegetable?
Okay, okay... They discover you have this horrible, disgusting, terminal illness, and they panic, for any number of perfectly valid reasons. They're frightened for themselves, their families... Maybe it's the homo angle. Maybe they don't want to rub elbows with someone who's just popped out of the closet with a terminal case of acne. And how do they explain your status to the client for Chrissake?
What?
Rayisha. Very nice.
One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead.
What happens?
I suppose you could say that.
You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to <u>have</u> a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club...
I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do.
Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens.
What?
You bet. We'll see you later.
Fucking Word Processing lost my Kronos complaint. Which must be filed by fucking five o'clock! If it's late, there's no case...  Every problem has a solution.
In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to.
That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
One. Here, in front of my ear.
Hold on, Mom.  There's no way my client will go along with that.
All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights.
Objection.
Is that a question?
Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings.
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did <u>not</u> know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
I'll rephrase.  Did you have anything to do with this file being... misplaced?
I'm not worried. What are you doing?
Right.
Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer.  I don't pick up people in drug stores every day.
Not especially.
Who?
Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo <u>vibe</u>?!
Yeah... ?
Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement.  Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
Any women on board?
How did you do that?
Yes, we did.
Joseph Miller, Your Honor. Macready and Shilts Legal Services.
You had one guy "like that?"
Helloooo...
Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?"
... It's time to get this society back on track!
It was just somebody else. From the crash. He was just....
No, we'd never....Oh, God, honey, you shoulda told me sooner.
Show me your eyes.
They're coming.
I got the quick-and-ugly version.
Saw something I didn't like.
Get out of our way.
Confusin' me with Johns now -- fear was <u>his</u> monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some shade of grey my eyes don't see.
Can we switch?
During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
Hey. Bein' ballsy with your life now doesn't change what came before -- it's just stupid.
Nothing we can't repair -- so long as the electrical adapts.
Let's wait on the power cells.
He also figured out how to kill the pilot, Fry.
I won't give him a chance to grab another ship -- or to slash another pilot's throat.
I never said I was.
Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
For your own fear.
What the hell's it matter?
We're just burnin' light here.
-- she tried to blow the whole fucking passenger cabin, tried to kill us --
What, you're goin' off, too?
Just tell me we're still in the shipping lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful, deep-space....
Company's not here, is it?
Rain.
There is no "safe."
Which half?
Be surprised what these will fetch in the Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here -- easy, easy. Very rare.
Not staying in here another....
Say that again.
For what? The honor of goin' back to some asshole of a cell?
I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
Looks clear.
No. She's not.
Kept calling it "murder" when I did it.
Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.
What do you care?
Did you forget our appointment, Cornelius?
You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for Animal Affairs?
Do you have any weapons?
Zaius seems to think there might be another jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That's what  we'll try for. What about you?
Good luck then.
What's so special about him?
Zira, come on. You know they can't --  Oh oh. Here comes Number One.
And they fell out of the sky with you?
That was before Dr. Zaius and half the Academy said the idea was heresy.
Yo!
That way.
What do you mean, made it? I'm an animal psychologist, that's all. We don't have any authority.
The foundations of scientific brain surgery are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these animals.
Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he not?
Some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.
See? He keeps pretending he can talk.
He's vicious, Doctor. Besides, it's against the rules.
Forget it. Abandon ship.
We're here to stay.
You don't seem very cut up about it.
long pause) You know it.
Prove it. If we can't get back, it's still just a theory.
Climb off me, will you!
Let's take a look.
Okay.
You're our optimist Look at the bright side. If that's the best there is around here, in six months we'll be running this planet.
What is it?
I think you're making a mistake.
What?
Keep moving. We can't turn back now.
Why special?
My own purpose is to save this exceptional creature from mutilation.
This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my story...
Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that monstrosity!
By your leave, Mr. President -- the Tribunal has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.
Mind your tongue, madame.
Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you performed a service for the State ...  Because your hearing made it possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius.  And now the Tribunal has placed you in my custody for...final disposition. Do you know what that means?
Emasculation, to begin with. Then experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a kind of living death.
All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?
Don't be a fool. You're outnumbered and outgunned.
All right, let's see if you're willing to put that statement to a test.
Wasn't I humiliated? By all of you? Didn't you lead me around on a leash?
We can't.
All right, but....  ...you're so damned ugly!
God bless you.
Like you, I find it difficult.
I'll get him. You get the man in, Taylor  NOW. Or I'll Article 15 both your asses. Move!
KILL YOU MOTHERFUCKER!!!
How the hell did he get away?
Yeah that long hairy orange and black bastard I found in the ammo crate. I'm gonna put it in this asshole's crotch, see if he can walk.
Yeah, what is it?
Fuck you bitch.
Yeah if you let me have your shirt.
Shaddup bitch.
Yeah, you had a piece of pussy on a plate in front of you, you'd probably kill it.
Sure, you probably stick it in tween her knees and think youse there.
Fuck this shit! I ain't dyin' in no white man's war! Ise didi-ing this motherfuckah!
Hang tough, Gator. Hang in there, man, you're gonna be OK... just hang on.
I got one...
Over here!
Yeah. I love this place at night. The stars... there's no right or wrong in them, they're just there.
Barnes believes in what he's doing.
In '65 - yeah. Now...  No. What happened today's just the beginning. We're gonna lose this war...
Shit, too bad we in base camp anyway.
Hey O'Neill why don't you cool it, you don't have to be a prick everyday of your life, you know.
Yeah, you done said it. Revenge on US.
He dugged his own grave.
Barnes took a bullet right there. At Ia Drang Valley...  And the cocksucker SURVIVED - that's BAAAD man. That's his high, baby. High on WAR!
Baaaa! Fuck it, they sold us out - so what! What'd you'all expect? Civilian life is phoney BULLSHIT man. They're ROBOTS man - watchin' dopey television and drivin' dopey cars, and they fuck up, nobody dies. That's all right, you keep fuckin' up, politicians keep lyin'. Cause it don't really matter. Don't mean shit. So what! Whatcha want - a parade! Fuck that too! No war time no grunt never got no respect. Till he was dead - and even THEN! You're fighting for YOURSELF man! You're fighting for your SOUL, dat's all. Remember dat. And it's some goddamn battle too - if you'se a man, wrestle with that angel...  ...Love and Hate - the whole shitbang show, that's the story then and now and it ain't hardly gonna change...
I don't want to hear about it Jackson.
Perhaps I don't take it so lightly.
Well..
I really don't know.
I'm supposing.
I'm not in the mood for dining and dancing.
I'm sure you have.
I haven't been invited.
Perhaps I'd better get you straightened out, Mr. Mitchell. You've been rather nice to me, in a couple of ways. And I'm grateful. But I don't think this entitles you to put me on a leash.
Would you mind?
Next time you try that, Mr. Mitchell...  ..don't. I'm warning you.
Immigration Officer?
Possibly, Miss.
I see.
He got in here how?
Bad enough.
Quarter after one. Why?
Is this the best you can do?
I didn't notice him.
Absolutely sure.
I know.  Killaine has a warrant.
Wrote it in the waiting room of the Hudson Bay Store.  With somebody's Pekingese trying to climb into my lap.  Perhaps you're right.  Perhaps I didn't mean it. All I know is that I'm licked.
That wasn't why I called you.  Why did I hope--when I hadn't any right to hope?
How bad is the other thing?  The secret?
But that's what I'm doing.  Couldn't they think of that?
That, and the fun of it.
And I'm begging for my life--and yours.
Every day of your life you'll want me.  You'll never get over it. Every time you see your face in the mirror--
I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
Beer?  Well, all right.
Ale. I don't mind.
Stop saying you're sorry. I want information, not regrets.
I've never been to Florida.
We wouldn't have met at all.
You were there when I last saw him.
You--or the Vancouver Police Department?
You understand perfectly.
I don't want to talk.
I might be able to save you.  If I knew enough.
Very ridiculous.
You're still a police officer, Jeff.  I saw you send those two men away. I know they were watching me.
I understand, Betty.  I understand perfectly.
Who's Goble?
Mayfield? Oh, that girl you were with last night. You haven't hired me yet. Mr. Brandon.
If I call the police, your price will go down to a minus sign.
For two hundred?
A thousand.
In the same elevator. It is a public conveyance.
Sometimes.
Leave that one lay.
The new ones are fine. The last set I had gave me all kinds of trouble.
I don't like to be tailed. The lady I'm with doesn't like to be stared at. To put the matter in a couple of nutshells, I don't like you.
How's life treating you?
No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
Delightfully. Every time Miss Mayfield says something, I know less than I did before.  Well, I may as well knock off for tonight.  Good night, Miss Mayfield. Do let me thank you for your cooperation.
I wouldn't know.
That must hurt.
Would that make me a heel?
Don't kid me.  You don't think she murdered Mitchell.
Your concentrating too hard, Killaine.  What about Margo West? She had a motive.  I guess you know by this time whose gun it was?
Now and then.  Mostly just for the fun of it.
I buy my shirts by the dozen. Fortunately.
What?
You don't throw guests out, Brandon.
Mr. Mitchell.
I see out friend Larry Mitchell is with us again.
Oh, shut up!  You haven't even got your spats on.
See how easy it is? Perhaps Miss Mayfield left her door unlocked. Or if she didn't, there's a passkey on every floor in the linen room. The head porter has a passkey. The bell captain has a passkey. The hotel's full of passkeys.
They'll arrest that girl. Everything points to her.
How clumsy. I'd never forgive myself. Good night my dear.
Floater?
Drunk-rolling job.  They hit him too hard.
I'd suggest a telegram.  Something like this: Chief of Police, San Francisco.  A licensed private detective named named Martin J. Goble, address so-and-so, has been found murdered within our jurisdiction.  His partner, name something-something Greer, refuses to give us any information. Correction.  Refuses information necessary to our investigation. Can you assist?  Signed Detective Sergeant Driscoll, Vancouver, British Columbia, Police. 
Would you?
Thanks, Inspector.  What are your orders about this wire to San Francisco?
The joint's not open, Mac.  Who's Brandon?
Talk English.  How do I know you're you?
I hate to pull rank on you Sergeant, but once in a while...for moral purposes...you might address me as "Inspector". In moments of extreme desperation, you might even call me "sir".
Maybe we've been pretty dumb--
If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
Did we ever really think it was suicide?
Warm water, no doubt.
I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains.  Why don't you ask her about the gun?
Of course not.  Thanks for telling me.  I haven't seen Mr. Clarendon.
I'm interested in who handled it.
That leaves two strangers.
The card says so, doesn't it?
I hear she's a very pretty girl.
Aye.  You have a point there.
A little of both, sir, and perhaps not quiet enough of either.
Who's the girl?
You ought to know why.
Splendid. Now she can return the compliment.
What does it look like?
You already have the checks, darling.
A girl you meet on the train. Excuse my bringing it up again.  Be back in an hour. Right?
It's kind of you to see me.
What a shame.
Yes.
Please do.  I was beginning to wonder who this Mr. Penfield was.
To James.  I remember what it was I was going to say.  We were talking about forgetfulness.  The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
Yes.
That doesn't matter.  As long as we can get our message through to someone there.  Jill, where are those handouts?
She's fine.  Well, actually we've broken up.  It's all over.
No thanks.  I'd like to break away--
Thank you.
That's her.
I quite liked it.  I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
Too bad.  What did your father do?
And you're at this third stage
You just might.
Let me see.
Yes, finally.
Suez.  1956.
Take a look at these.
The bed's all made up if you want to stay.
She said that?
And you're so beautiful.  What are you doing here?
In that case, you should meet my very dear friend, James Penfield. Brilliant analyst of recent history and a world authority on the Berlin Airlift.
Yeah, my knee got folded about 90 degrees the wrong way.
Not yet.
No, Bells Beach, Australia.
Yeah, right, vision is highly over- rated.
My man!
You do it... you first!
Insurance policy.  Now this is going to sting a bit, but it's for your own growth, brah.  Press play.
And let my policy expire?  Sorry.
What if your chute fails, Bodhi? Rescind the order.  Let her off the hook, she's served her purpose.  Do it, man, you owe me that much.  Let me hear it before you check out.
No games, Bodhi.  Pull the cord! Now!!
I asked them to give me a couple minutes...
Have you seen a little dog?  Kind of a cockapoo lookin' thing.  About this big.
Yes, sir.
Supervising Special Agent, Harp. Now I want you to go work the drop car, okay, Angelo?  Okay?
What that?
Punk.  Quarterback Punk.
Yeah, they control the room well. Stick strictly to the cash drawers.
Never go for the vault.  They never get greedy.
The fucking punks are surfers.
Shutup, you might learn somethin' you're not careful... So last year Nixon scuffs a counter going over. There was a soil sample.  Non- specific mud traces of asphalt, oils, blah, blah... sand and... carnuba wax.  So I became a wax expert.  There's 80 some uses for this stuff, something like five hundred products.
Why can't I just walk around with this thing under my arm and act stoned?  Ask a few questions.
Patience hotshot.  Patience.  It'll be subtle, if it's here at all.
He's pushing it through first thing. You better get some sleep tonight, it could be an interesting morning.
Angelo, we gotta talk.
Did he rob it?
Yeah, or cashing a check.
Look, we handle it ourselves, for right now, okay?  We cover the bank, whatever.  You and me.  That way if nothing happens, or more accurately, when nothing happens... I don't get my tits any further into the wringer than they already are.
Shrimp and fries.
I'm serious.
No, no.  See, all my life I've done things for other people.  In high school I played football because my old man expected me to.  Then my parents always figured I'd go to law school, so I did.  Football scholarship.  Graduated Phi Beta Kappa--
He rents it for the summer.  Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around.  Most a these guys can't keep a job.  When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them.  But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
What?
I... I don't know.  I can't describe what I'm feeling.
Warm them up.
Fuck you, Johnny Utah.  Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul?  Goddamn you to hell!
Who cares!
Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them.
Anytime.
What's that, General?
There's no sign of it.
You're not getting any navy contracts.
But I do know.  I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will...  Ah, the escargot.
No.
I see.  Well.  Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
I'd like to find out.  You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
You what?
How?
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
You're not from L.A., huh?
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
I never joke about money.
Can I have some chips?
Do you plan everything?
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Why?
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Just a romantic, that's you.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
"Occupational hazard".
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant.  It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Television?
Thank you.  I would.  Nice.
I think it's exciting.
Would you please calm down.  Tell me what happened.
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Fine.  I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
Shush.  Of course you can.
You won't.
Where are you taking me!?
Vivian.  I'm paying you to be you.  Be you.  Have you?  Ever been in love with anyone?
I more than liked it.
Vivian, I want you to listen to me.  The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
It's not your concern.  It's... business, that's all.
Not all men hit.  And no one is going to hit you anymore.
It was good.
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Of course, yes.  If you'll excuse me just a moment --
Eight o'clock.  Kross is bringing his son.  Very bright kid, watch yourself with him.  Who's this girl you're taking?
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
Goodbye, Bill.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
Rent.  You're late.
Of rent I do not bullshit.
What?
You're a guest here?
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian.  John, call a limousine for our guest, please.  Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go.  Bill the hotel.  See you again sometime soon.
Excuse me?
I don't think we have anything for you here.  You're obviously in the wrong place.
'Scume me.
Do you remember me?
I just might do that.
Then I'm here till I die?
I do not marry tonight.
I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
I will never doubt again.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
Gently!!
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
Anybody want a peanut?
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
I'm waiting!
-- what? --
-- where?
The body?
What's the difference?  We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
I don't be-leeve this.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Because I can stop now if you want.
All right, then. No more interruptions.  ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
As you wish...
The gate has but one key, and I carry that.
DEATH FIRST!!
I swear it will be done.
Of course.
Yes.
Oh, I know. The people are quite taken with her. It's odd, but when I hired Vizzini to have her murdered on our engagement day, I thought that was clever. But it's going to be so much more moving when I strangle her on our wedding night. Once Guilder is blamed, the nation will be truly outraged. They'll demand we go to war.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
-- offer me money --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
That is a noble cause. Give me the sixty-five, I'm on the job.
Again. Thank you.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
You're sure nobody's following us?
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means.  My God! He's climbing.
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
Morons.
For the Princess?
I smell nothing.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you?  You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
An hour.
A little bit.
He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that.
"Honeymoon,
Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there.
Sir, may I speak to you for a minute?
Where?  What?
Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ...
Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need.
You've done it yourself, only you did it on a very small scale.
Ahhhhhh!  But that's where you made your error.  You didn't go all the way.  You see, if you were really a bold criminal, you could have raised a million.
But what if the play was a hit?
What scheme?  Your scheme, you bloody little genius.
Go away from me.  You frighten me.  Sit over there.
It's a little better, but you still look angry.
Thank you, Leo.  And call me Max. You know, I don't let everybody call me Max.  It's only people I really like.
Well, Max, I don't know, Max.  What do you think, Max?
Right.
I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green.
Mrs. Virginia Resnick.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy.
Stop talking like that, you white mouse!  Nothing's going to go wrong. As a matter of fact, today I have taken steps to insure total disaster. At two o'clock we have an appointment with none other than Roger De Bris.
No way out.  No way out.
No way out.  No way out.  What?  Who?
I'm turning myself in.  It's the only way.  I'm going to cooperate with the authorities.  They'll reduce my sentence and then there's time off for good behavior.  And maybe I'll get a job in the prison library.  So long.
What???
What is it?
He's a liar and a cheat and a scoundrel.  He's taken money from little old ladies.  He's talked people into doing things they never would have dreamed of.  Especially me.  But who has he really hurt? 
Yes.
With whom?
Don't look at the outside, look at the inside.  It's the inner Hitler we're after.  The young beautiful Hitler, who danced his way to glory.
You mean out of business.  Heh, heh.
You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?
All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here.
Got dag pa dig.
Nice girl.
We can't play today?
Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me.
Wagner...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
Oh joy of joys!  Oh, dream of dreams!  I can't believe it.  Birds, birds, do you hear?  Otto, Bertz, Heintz, Hans, Wolfgang, do you hear?  Ve are going to clear the Fuhrer's name.  Fly, fly, spread the words.
"Deutchland, Deutchland ... "
Vat?
Stop!  Stop!  This is insanity.
What have you done, LSD?
I told them we invaded England.
In the past two days I've been to so many motels, my eyes are bleary with neon. This is the first one that looked like it was hiding from the world at large.
She might have used an alias. Mary Crane's the real name, but she might've registered...
Tell me all about her.
Of which morning?
No one met her?
You didn't spend the whole night with her did you?
Someone is sitting in that window.
If this girl Mary Crane were here, you'd have no reason to hide her would you?
Or if she had you say... gallantly protecting her... you wouldn't be fooled... you'd know she was just using you. Wouldn't you?
No! Just no!  I have one of those breaking points like any other man, believe it or not, and I'm near it. There's just so much pushing I can take and I think...
Who are you, friend?
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
You got aspirins? I have something... not aspirins, but  my mother's doctor gave these to me the day of my wedding.  Teddy was furious when he found out I'd taken tranquilizers!
Now. Your sister is missing how long?
How'd you and this detective come to trace her to Fairvale?
And the police haven't been able to...
With the forty thousand dollars?
Norman Bates' mother has been dead and buried in Greenlawn Cemetery for the last ten years!
Just what he told your detective.
May I talk to you?
Lila.
With you.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
You might have doubted for say five minutes or so, Sister.
How could I go away? I'm in debt up to my...  If she did steal that money...  It's hard to believe she did because it's hard to see why she would. Unless she had some wild idea that it would help me... us...
I think she'll contact me if she contacts anybody. Why don't you stay here. When she shows up... or calls... be here.
First rate hotel, fifty yards up the street. Come on.  After we check you in we'll go to the drugstore and get you a sandwich. Then we'll come back here... and wait.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Yes.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Just wait here?
Does that mean we can't...
Of course we will.
We were going to get married. Are going to get married!
Watch your tenses.
Hospital clean.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
Do we simply ask him where he's hidden it?
I could stand something regular.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Sam!
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
Sam, let's go get married.
You have a vacancy?
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
Los Angeles.
It's not as expensive as you'd think. Cheap, really. Needles, thread, sawdust .. the chemicals are all that cost anything. 
Friends? Who needs friends.  A boy's best friend is his mother.  You've never had an empty moment in your whole life. Have you?
Oh I do... but I say I don't. 
To a private island, like you?
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out.  Before it's too late for me, too.
Very early. Dawn.
Then I'm free to go...?
I'm sorry.
Why?
Maybe you saw Mary!
At this hour?
You must remember that bad business out there. About ten years ago...
Arbogast.
It ain't only local history, Sam, it's the only murder-and-suicide case in Fairvale ledgers! Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy she was... involved with, when she found out he was married, then took a helping of the same stuff herself.  Strychnine. Ugly way to die.
Haven't any.
That would be a rather extreme reaction, wouldn't it?
I didn't think so.
Left Phoenix under her own steam?
Explains the private detective. He traced her to the Bates place.  What'd he exactly say when he called you?
Yes! In the house behind the motel. I pounded and called but she... just ignored me.
Did I?
What--special autopsy?
[Was it] &quot;Meirschultz&quot;?
Indeed, he has often told me.
I am certainly glad to hear it. I know he'll be pleased.
Sh--sh--I want to have a few words with you quietly.
I knew there was a catch in this some place--but spill it. Quiet and dramatic. MAXWELL In the other room, I have a crazy woman that I have been treating.
Quiet, will you? This is ser- ious. Our lives are in danger.
How about me getting the help. She's quiet now, isn't she?
Take him to the psychopathic hospital.
Maybe you're right.
Yeah--thousands, and right in my back yard.
You found Buckley?
Oh, Maxwell? He's left.
Do you have many patients, doctor?
Joseph returns from the room where Gisèle is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees the open diary and begins reading it.
No -- the only thing I did for him was to keep track of the man named Worth that runs the place where you arrested me tonight.
I wondered. Did he invite you to lunch, or did you invite him?
I'll have it for supper.  So long.
Delighted, I'm sure. 
What's nice about her? ... a hard-boiled little gold digger.
I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
It is no trouble at all, my child. This is the strange, vicarious pleasure that remains for me -- to see others enjoy the beauty I used to create.  My footing is not too secure.
And I have no desire to hurt you. You will always be beautiful. Think, my child, in a thousand years you will be as lovely as you are now.
Don't take my word for it. Get down there yourself and give a look.
You mean he was colored?
Nothing doing. This is my percentage. You birds are going to get yours. And anyhow, I found this dump.
What do you mean, you poor ham! This is New Year's!
All right, you said I was fired. Well, I quit! Give the assignment to somebody else. 
Get out of here.
I want to see the original pictures of Joan Gale.
No kiddin'. What's your idea?
About the Gale girl, I mean. Where do we go from there? What of it?
Almost certain.
Yes, you could. Cut out this rotten business and act like a lady. Marry me.
Say, if you're stringin' me, Old-Timer ...
It's all yours.
Stories scarcer than caviar at a street cleaner's banquet, and he says, bring me a yarn. All I have to do is get a story.
Gee, that's great. After the bad opening that night the old boy was pretty blue. This will pep him up. Have you told him about it?
For a few minutes the afternoon before -- before --
They didn't give me a chance. We had a couple of drinks and she was all right then. She seemed happy.
Not even if it gives you a clean bill of health?
I told you what to do. Drive around the corner out of sight of the house. I want to get a closer look at the place.
No -- No -- I -- I -- I don't want to see it. 
You go in for dangerous things.
I suppose this is going to sound absurd. I've only known you twenty-four hours, but I'm in love with you.
Don't ask any questions. Come on!
You're insane.
That is unfortunate. They will have to wait.
He can't hear you.
Good. Well, I'll be seeing you.
Thanks.
That's the physicist's playground.
It's an experiment.
What universe are you in, Paul?
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
But, Rose, how could such a thing as that happen?
What did you expect?
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose.
Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you.
Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty...
Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me?  I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you.
But why, if I'm not hurting you?
No. No, I'm all right.  Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell!  I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
Rose, you are too uncritical of people.
Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy.
You won't die, Rose.
I don't want to know...
She's getting herself up to go out.
Yeah.
Is that all?
Buddy, that was my place.
Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so.
Hello, Daddy. How are you?
Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her?
Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son.
No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say?
She was fifty-six, son. Of course she didn't look it, nowhere near it. The cancer came back, I'm afraid I fibbed about that. But it was very quick, son. She was in the hospital only two weeks, and the last week she didn't know anything.
It's true, son. The girl with the cornflower eyes is dead, she is no more,
Any major operation is dangerous. However, as we know from her previous illness, she's a very strong girl.
I think we both know her.
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
I don't care where the polecat studied.
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.
Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal!
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
All right. Now as head of this household I have a couple of remarks to make. It is my dear wife's belief, which I accept although I do not totally grasp it, that to hire a person to do household work is a criminal practice. Therefore, you are here not as a servant, you are here as a friend, as a guest and hopefully as a member of this family. You will eat your meals with us, you will share life itself with us -- in love and harmony, dear Rosebud, in love and harmony. Do you understand me?
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
Well, it has buttons.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Yes, sir.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Oh, no, sir.
I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose.
Where is he? Where have you got him hid?  Ah, ha!
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
What's the use, there ain't none.
Tennessee?
What?
All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant?
Page proof of a book I'm working on.
Well, actually, we have a little black boy named Her---t who lives in the garage. He does it for me.
That's right, Dave, I'm headed for Glenville on a whisperin' jet.
That's correct -- outside it, not in it. As for the job, well, the Jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry-ass damn.  But I can build anything, Buddy. Give me the plans and I can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. It's a fact, I can build anything...  ... but she never believed that. Oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.
Doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. I never remarried, Buddy, you know that, don't you?
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
She looks terrible, just awful.
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely.
Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
Yes, Ma'am.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
I don't mind.
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
I'm looking at this poster, and I'm thinkin', I don't remember seeing films like this when I was in school.
... okay... you made your point.
I'll tell you what... I think it's all you've got.
Now you know what to watch for...
Hey, listen... I'll give you something else, Kittle.  Anything. Remember... remember that corpse washed up on Huntington Beach?  It was never identified...
Where you been hiding, grease-fist? We've been looking for you.
Alright!  Alright... put me down...
It's the way you say it, like there's something more too it.
Thank you, concerned citizen.
I'll give you a fucking hoot if you don't shut up back there.
Whoa, thanks, man.  These are cool. They'll be collector's items.
We catch 'em, I wanna be first to hurt 'em.  Promise me I get to go first.
No you can't.
Well... we shouldn't rush into this, right?  Let's talk about it.
Who's that?  Zimmermann's money-man?
Clench your teeth so when we land you don't accidentally bite off your tongue.
No, but it should.
You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
We have to find Kittle.
Well, I got something..  Pop-Sweet's accounting ledger for the Disco-Strip.  All the money transactions.  Look...  Someone's putting their initials beside the weekly totals.  Like they're acknowledging a deposit.
Can't you say something nice once?
I'm waiting till the time's right.
No.
We've got the tape to prove it.
It's our job.
"Today you have a rare opportunity to make a big difference in your chosen field.  By your able leadership and with great conviction and strength of character, you will come up a winner."
First of all, the Constitution wasn't writtem till 1787...
Let's hope.
Okay, okay... hold on.  Don't go getting your panties in a knot...
He's right.  We hit the bricks, we walk back triple-fucked.
Gimmie a minute.
A.D. is a C.P.A.
I'm well aware of that.
That's the problem with expensive tastes... the more you got, the more you got to lose.
You won't get another chance at this, Admiral.
Yoda will always be with you.
You cannot escape your destiny.
I can't kill my own father.
I can't see.
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker.
A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor.
Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them.
Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything.
Hi, Han... Chewie.
It'll work. It'll work.
It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us.
Charges!  Come on, come on!
Here's the terminal.
No, wait! I thought you were blind!
Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.
All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right?
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive dialect.  But I do believe they think I am some sort of god.
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.
Quiet.
Just...images, really. Feelings.
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.  Why are you asking me all this?
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it.
But, why must you confront him?
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go of your hate.
I will not fight you, father.
I will not fight you.
Never-r-r!
I'm afraid so, Brad.  But wasn't it nice?
I told you, my car broke down.
Janet.
For you.
Dammit, Janet.
Yes.
Say!  Do any of you guys know the Madison?
We'll just say where we are Then go back to the car We don't want to be any worry.
Uh - oh - Hi!  My name is Brad Majors. And this is my fiancee, Janet Weiss.  I - ah - wondered if you could help us.  Our car has broken down about two miles up the road.  Do you have a phone we might use?
You must leave now Dr Scott while it's still possible.  We are about to beam the entire house back to the planet of transexual in the galaxy of Transylvania. Go now.
Nothing.  Why, do you think I should?
Like this - like how?  It's your fault. You're to blame.  I was saving myself.
Makes you cry
Makes you cry
Oh my, my,
That ain't no crime
Oh no no no no.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime - That ain't no crime.
No.  You've arrived on a rather special night.  It's one of the master's affairs.
Ah - sweet Transexual - land of night - to sing and dance once more to your dark refrains.  To take that step to the right...
...Fine.
...I'm sorry.
Absolutely.
Ohh!
By accident?
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
...I suppose.
Morning after?
...No thanks.
Yes, I do.
It's fine.
I should leave.
Do me another favor?
Don't tease me.
Don't want weak legs.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
...What?
...What?
What're we going to do?
Paul.
It's not your house --
I want 'im outta here --  Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo?  That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo!  You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs!  I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
Shaw's fighting in South America -- Why not postpone the bout until July Fourth?
Apollo, I'm sure there's a way to salvage this.
Rocky Balboa -- His record's poor --
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Don't like yours neither.
Move your shoulders down.
No dollar.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
Round three ready to start and should be interesting to see if Creed can put the challenger away -- there goes the bell.
Not only has he refused to fall, but he has beaten the Champion's body without mercy and the bout has become a vicious slugfest.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
...Fine.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
Rocky.
Sparrin'?
Stuff it, man!
I won't.
Yeah.
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Freak luck for sure.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
Yo, Benny.
'Bout what?
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
...No.
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
You serve martinis, doncha?
C'mon, Valiant, doesn't this whole thing smell a bit funny to you?  I mean, no offense, but how did a mucky-muck like R.K. Maroon find you in the first place?
So where is it then?
Stick to stuffin' the olives, willya, Dolores?
He's a Toon... who cares?
Dolores, meet Roger Rabbit.
Yeah, do that.  I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
Toon cops worked me over.
Okay, you've seen me.  Now give me a towel.
It's the truth.  Why won't you believe it?
Why didn't you tell me?
When I opened up the blue envelope, all that was inside was a blank piece of paper.
Just haven't been this close to Toontown for awhile.
Doom.
So's the job.
As soon as is humanly possible.
Sure, Valiant, sure...
Valiant?  What're you doin' here?
Take it easy.
Aah!
Well, no, not <u>any</u> time.  Only when it was funny.
My philosophy is if you don't have a sense of humor, you're better off dead.
I resent that innuendo!  My wife is completely innocent.
Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club.  It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
And when they're done laughin' , they're gonna call the cops.  That guy Angelo would rat on you for a nickel!
I think I prefer the Smith and Wesson variety.
A blindfold, cigarette, noseplugs? Just kidding.
My brother.  Get inside.
Gee, you shamuses are a tough audience, but what happened to you that was so dark, lurid, embittering?
That's why I'll be there at 8:45.
I followed you to the Maroon Studios. When I heard those shots, I thought I'd help you and investigate the inside of this trunk.
Not before I satisfy my sense of moral outrage.
That's because it's Disappearing-Reappearing Ink.  Shows up three days later.  Gives you enough time to get away from the victim so he doesn't punch you in the nose.  Great gag.
Good idea.
From this box here...
I will bite my thumb at them; which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
The what?
Good-morrow, cousin.
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
But 'tis no wit to go.
Art thou hurt?
Go to! What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to; Make a mutiny among my guests?!
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
She'll not come down tonight.
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Amen
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Well, what was yours?
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
I am for you.
Always in a rush, you are.  All these years I've known you, you could never wait for anything.
Finding this package is a thing easier said than done.  We don't even know what it is.  What did we steal?
So where do you go from here?
Which leads us to...
Best beer in the world known to man or God.
It means I was worried that all the time you spent away from the fold might have affected you.  You've been living the life of the hired gun -- the well paid hired gun, I might note.  There's no glory to it, but there are those that like it.
No, Seamus.  I heard you the first time.
Is that right?
I probably do.  But for the time being, I'm willing to forget about it...
Not likely.  Once, yeah, I was -- but there wasn't an inch of profit in it, and I'm a cash oriented girl, if you take my meaning.  I'm a hired gun, same as the rest of you, and that's all any of us needs to know about the other.
Good, because it cost enough.  There's cheaper phones by far than that one, man: you better fucking use it.
There's a problem...
I'll destroy whatever's in the case.
But you hate each other!
A post office box.
Much to your disappointment, no doubt.
I'm in the middle of saving you people a great deal of money -- the least you could do is have the decency to pay me!
That's it.
Hello, my friend.  He doesn't look French to me, Vincent.
I suppose I want to know how a man like you is created.
Anybody tries to unpleasant me I'll put two between his eyes -- one to do the job and the other to make sure it takes.
Why don't you go do better, then...
I blast the lead car into oblivion...
I don't think so.
No thanks.
To see a man about a thing.
That's what I thought.
Let's just say I thought the conversational possibilities were limited.  Of course, I might have brought Gregor, but he didn't seem like the right candidate -- for this.
I just wanted to see something.
I needed to see if you were a cop.  I'm a popular man with the police, Sam, and whenever they try to catch me they always do it with an inside guy -- some man on some job who seems more trustworthy than all the others put together.  And that's the guy you have to watch out for.  I hate cops...
Know what?
But you can't.
It's my job.
Yeah.  We need out fucking heads examined.
If I'm going to die for the CIA, I'm going to go out smoking.  Besides, there's half a forest between us and them, they can't see a goddamned thing.
Why then, Sam, don't you act like this is a job like any other?  Surely, if you are a hired gun, you realize that some times you just have to walk away without getting what you came for.
Finish the job...
You don't owe me a goddamned thing, Vincent, and you know it.  You stepped in front of a bullet for me.  I owe you a heavy debt.
I don't know.  Nobody knows, except a bunch of people who are too dead to tell us.  There's probably a couple of guys back at the Company who know, but I don't think they plan to tell me anytime soon.
It's an international thing.  Several different peoples involved, criminals from all over the world, experts brought together to do a job.  But maybe the most interesting thing about it is that preeminent in the plot we find the Russian Mob and the IRA in bed together. An unlikely group of partners.
Why didn't you kill him?
Matter of face there's this flick I've been hearing about.  I haven't seen it, but from what I hear it's pretty cool.
I get the picture.
I can't get enough of it.
Sure thing, and --
The horniest dog in Nevada.
Maybe.  Who cares?
What's that?
He saw everything!
Listen.  Do you want to go to jail? Taking evidence, tampering with a crime scene.  You know what they'd do.
Exactly.  This is our little secret, partner.
Well doesn't he?  Besides if the DEA heard that tape we'd be behind bars right now.  Just call it the cost of doing business.  This whole thing is screwed up.  I'm thinking.  Maybe we should tell 'em the truth...
All we have to do is get our hands on the original tape.  We'll set him up somehow.
Yeah, I mean you're coming unglued, Jesse.
No.
Like hell it is.  This is Jesse! Jesse!
It was all used.  Random numbers. How can they trace it?
Two thousand...
Just take it in stride.
You better believe it if you know what's good for you!
Hello.
He's irresponsible.
I might have to look into that...
Nothing.
You deserve it is the occasion.
Nothing happened?
There isn't gonna be a next time. We're gonna get out of here.
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
I'll be there for you.  He won't try anything while I'm there.  I promise.  I'll protect you.
I'm not sure why.  It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
I don't know.  My friends...
I don't believe it.
You know I do.
A week ago, at most.
Yeah.
You didn't answer my question. Are you saying my word is of no value to you?
First you question my integrity, then you call me stupid...  ...that hurts, son.
Don't worry the real men are in charge now.
Excellent. I'll go down with you.
Fine.  The information doesn't leave this room.
Did you say After Midnight?
So there was money there!  Who the hell's money is it?!
Well I just uh, you know...
Anything...specific?
Hmmm...
Oh yeah.  Between here and Vegas we get a lot of customers.  All types.  Even had an officer, just like you.
Dammit you’re persistent.  I don’t want to listen to this anymore.  No more bets with you.
Take it or leave it.
Sort of.
I can't hear a word you're saying!
And if we refuse?  Your tampering with evidence isn't exactly a misdemeanor, did you ever consider that?
So I want the money and I want it now.
We gotta, Jesse.  It's tough, but you didn't leave us any choice.  We gotta know where the tapes are.
Absolutely positively.
So someone did get away.
No, it doesn't.  Neither does his blank tape.  Any news on that?
We're going to find out.
No, sir.
How much is that?
I'm with the band.  I'm the lead singer.
What??  Where'd you hear that?
You've been asking loud questions in all the wrong places all morning.  How come you always save me for last, James? When are you gonna learn.  Shit don't happen I don't know about.
I know Teddy Wu is cranking out a pretty good double sawbuck -- but you knew that too, didn't you?
One of my regulars lost fifty thousand dollars at the table here last week.  I was about to send my boys down to tune his ass up, when the guy comes in and pays off the whole thing.  Including the vig -- brand new sequential hundred dollar bills.  I knew something was wrong.  Cause this guy's got a regular job, no way he comes up with fifty grand in cash. But I tested the bills, infrared.  The whole thing.  And they checked out. 100%.
Isabella Molina, from San Juan.  That seat is taken.
I don't think so.
I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party.
So what's your story?
In 1959, the United States was very friendly with the Shah of Iran.  We wanted his oil, so for the Shah's birthday, the government gave him a gift -- a U.S. Treasury Intaglio press.  The only one to ever leave the country. Five years ago Ricky Tan bought that press on the black market.
Never leave home without it.  Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money.
No.
Blend in?  I'm two feet taller than everyone here.  Where you going?
Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people!
Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done.
You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking.
How you doin'?
Don't look at my ass!
Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home.
Who?
I'm okay, you go.
I'll bitch slap you into Bangkok.
No.  She's a school teacher.
Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked.
Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off.
He just left.  Kissed her on the cheek.
How do you know?
I'm sorry, Lee.  Why did she leave you?
Excuse me?
Just don't fall asleep.  Sooner or later something's gonna happen.
What's going on?
Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you.
Oh, sweet glory hallelujah...
Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy.
What?
It's a bomb.
We both know you would never take a bullet for someone else.
Mind your own business.
There was no sex.  She was very traditional.  We were waiting until we were married.
Once in a while, steamed dumplings.  But only when she was drunk.
Tell me the truth, Carter.  Do you think I have a good voice?
I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something?
A Chinese man discovered electricity.
Don't you talk about my mama.  That's more like it.
What?!?!
Carter...
About fifty grand.  I won it at the tables.
This money is evidence.
The Plaza Hotel?
Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you --
Just trying to make it look real.
How do I know I can trust you?
No.  But I'll help you.
The Praying Mantis school, in Bejing?
Any leads?
The police can protect you.
Put the plates down.  It's over.
Animals kill only from hunger or fear. The man you seek is lower than a serpent.  ...he kills for money.
I know, Master, but...
Heaven on Earth?  Master, I don't understand.  A temple, where Heaven is on Earth?  A mountain, where Earth reaches for the --
This is still Hong Kong.
Hey, that's whacked!  I thought we was gettin' on here!
I know, but --
Carter.
Okay, I'll slow down.  So we go downtown and we ask you a few questions... you know, like what's your name?  How old are you?  You ever expose yourself in public...shit like that.
I didn't say I didn't.  You assumed I didn't.
I am not responsible for your assumptions.
What?
Hey, stop.  We're just gonna wind up in some bar, drinking' to forget all the things we shoulda done and then you'll start singin' Beach Boy songs again. Then I'll really get depressed.
Hey, everybody fits in here. Look at L.A., man.  Nobody's from here.  My momma's from Detroit, my dad's from Atlanta, they met in Texas, got married in Vegas and I was born in Alabama.  So where the hell am I from? Kenya?
Stooly.
Yes, I think so.
Yee-aww.
Good God, ya'll!
I got to stop that dancing in the street Œtill all hours.
No, fish is a PM food.
It's him.
I am from outa town.
What?
You know him?
Good. That's standard military packaging for plastique. Get a look under it.
No way in the way!  I'm talkin' back up, Johnson. I'm in charge! And I need you, baby.
That's it! You can attack me, but when you attack my car, I cannot forgive! You in the back, girl!
At this point we don't have much.
Just make him think you're following leads.  Interview some suspects, look at fingerprints, do detective shit.  I don't care.  I just don't want to see him- or you, for that matter- until this is resolved.  Now, we want to make a good impression, don't we?  His plane lands in an hour. Don't be late.
Why don't you try the assignment.  Or should I call and ask for somebody who can handle it?
Nobody touches me.
Do it!
How did I do this?! Maybe you didn't notice but I'm in jail!
You don't. He finds you. Through his people.
You have run out of time.  The amount now is two hundred million.  I will call later with instructions.  You will either deliver the money or pick up the body of your daughter.
I understand, sir. But you are an honored guest of the United States...
Yes sir, me too. The State Department has authorized release of the funds. We'll have to make the first drop at 7.  As soon as they pick up the money, we've got Œem.
Soon Young, don't worry.  You will have many friends very soon.  You will see.  America is a very friendly place.
Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. "I'm not..."
Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
Thank you.
I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter.
I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
I left four messages.  You don't return my calls.
What?
Where do you think she's going?
Or does she pick "NGB'S" -- "Nice Guys, But..."  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison.
Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy?
Unbelievable, she got to you.
Are you a reporter?
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
Betty Trout.  Five dollars.
-- The luau for Maggie.
You'll answer my questions?
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
He is not!
Seven-fifty.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
You don't know.
Can you fix it?
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
I don't know.  I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Well, you do have the dress.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics.  Traitor!
It's something I've always wanted to do.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
It's probably because you got him fired.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Yeah.
-- who's married to --
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
I love you.
Nope.  Not even when I was young.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
And then I'll see you in New York --
You couldn't.
Not really.  Look, Annie, I love you.  Let's leave that out of it.  I don't want to be someone you're settling for.  I don't want to be someone anyone settles for.  I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool.  There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring.  If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
Nothing's with me.
Not.
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Is this crazy?
Good night.
He said hello.
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
So I mailed your letter.
Okay.
So you want a financial, is he a deadbeat, we can do a D&B --
A sense of humor.
Oh.  Like Glenn Close in that movie.
I got married because Betsy said we had to break up or get married.  So we get married.
Yes, I did.
We'll move them --
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
What?
Magic.
Mom, we already...
Magic.
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Have you had any relationship since?
What's she talking about?
It's not that late in Seattle.
Yeah.
How about rapacious and love- starved?
Right, right.
Nobody knows.  It changes practically every day.  How much money do you have?
I don't think I have to now.
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
I forgot to mention.  Jed called --
Thank God.  Something you don't know.  It's a single white female.
It doesn't.  They ask you.
What do you think?
What was?
You're worried we're going to be all right.  We're going to be all right.  I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby.  Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
There she is.
No.
I just called for a second.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
You must be Jonah.
He's over at the boat show. He'll be by later.  It's so beautiful here.
I tried to talk to her...  It was like I knew her.  Weird.
Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
I read the same article...
Why didn't you give a warning signal?
There's nothing stopping you.
Whose side are you on anyway?
What do you mean -- sex equality?
So much the better.
He will if he wants us to go on blasting.
Sure. Where they're negotiating. In the company office. We'll go up there and picket the place.
No. No. I can't. If Ramón ever found me on a picket line ...
Don't you worry. We'll get some action.
What's more important than sanitation?
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
Antonio paid for it.
I did forget. Luís told me.
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
Yes.
I'm going back tomorrow.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Hunting.
Sun up.
Who said anything about giving up? I'll never go back to the company on my knees. Never.
You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
New York? You're not the Company President by any chance?
I thought maybe you forgot...
She's coming. Charley Vidal gave her a lift.
The what!
You should have helped her without being asked.
You ... You ... I'd expect it of an Anglo, yes ... but you ...
Yeah? First door on the right. It ain't that dirty.  Just kinda' filthy is all.
Shhh.
Um, coupla' eight balls oughta do us.
How about in the house?
I understand. Thanks anyway.
I was thinking Alice Cooper.
Leave me out of this.
Colette ...
Look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?
There's nothing to understand. The guy is a pig.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
You don't like the tune, find another station.
Therapy session is over.
Please open the door, Danny.
What about a battered woman's shelter? You can move you kid in with you.
They would have killed you too.
I'm fine. Little nervous...little disappointed that I didn't finish this myself.
Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
Guess it's our turn.
I know a guy.
Sorry.
You. You're smooth. You use words like dire and shit.  You got language skills, man.
Can you set that up?
I think on account of his nose.
He doesn't have one.
John Fitzgerald Kennedy.
Tem thousand dollars. Everything I could spare.  It's for you.
It's you! I didn't have a picture or nothin' so I had to describe you to the guy. Not bad though, huh?
I'm not a tweaker.  I don't use drugs. I never had.
I can't tell you.
I'm sorry. I couldn't.
You're a good man. Jimmy the Finn.
Um, I think the Warren Commission has been closed for a while.
Crank or glass?
Make me an offer.
I deal in U.S. pounds, friend. None of that faggot metric crap for me.
Hey, okay.
Pull your pants down.
What?!
What the fuck are you gonna do about it, dickhead?
Just the way the world works.  Look, as far as tweakers go, you aren't a bad guy.  You never hurt anyone but yourself as far as I know.
This chink have a name?
Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear.  I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
News-flash, Tanner. I'm a fucking rat.
What's to stop him from just ripping me off then?
I'm afraid so, Danny.
My name is Tom.
It speaks!
To who?
And what does this have to do with me?
What?!
Anyone ever ask you to be such a disrespectful smart-ass all the time?
And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne.  Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
Several possession charges, but nothing major.
They have. But they never found a lab.
What if he caps me before you can make a move?
I'm making the small buy tonight ... if I don't get beaten to death with a wheelchair or something.  If everyone is happy, we'll do the big deal later in the week.
Hey, do you think you could eat me if you had to?  And if so, which part do you think you would find the most delicious?
Okay, okay.  There's a house up there. I'll go ask for directions.
What do you mean?
That's not good in prison. It's just not good.
Good work, Flynne.  You're a first-rate rat.
Don't worry about it.
I thought you were done.
Where are your men now?
I'm sending Simpson to take over for you, the division is going to Caen, you're not coming with us, I have something else for you.
There's a Private James Ryan who parachuted in with the Hundred-and- First near Ramelle.  I want you to take a squad up there.  If he's alive, bring him back to the beach for debarkation.  Take whoever you need, you've got your pick of the company.
He's the last of four brothers, the other three were killed in action. This is straight from the Chief of Staff.
Spit it out, Captain.
Thank you, sir.
No kidding.
You must be a hell a shot.
You got somethin' against the Cap'n?
Nope, he ain't Wade.
Like hell, you did.
In the shadow by those two trees.
Sir, I ain't feeling so chipper on account of Wade.
You'll grieve the way I tell you to goddamned grieve.  There is no Wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?
Good, now get your goddamned gear.
That's General Gavin's.  His lap dog told me if anyone breathes on it, I'll get busted and if anyone so much as touches it with their little finger, I'll get court marshaled. If you were to take it, they'd shoot me.
Plenty.
You don't count.
Those guns are close.
But, sir...
Maybe.
Since when have things been normal?
They're fine.  As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
How about I go right, sir?
More morphine, hurry up, come on, come on...
Let's just find someplace.
Bits and pieces.
It could be worse.  You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.? Lie to your men.
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.  So if you're scared or empty or half-a-step from a Section Eight, do you tell your men?  Of course not.  You bluff, you lie.
I think you're right, Keith.
We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
Sure, meet me at the top, we'll start the paperwork.
Don't worry, we're the only Rangers this side of the continent, we've got to be first into Caen.
No, I'm not, Kaback is, honest.  Or what about Faulkner?  Or that little guy with the glasses?
Sure, Reiben.
Reiben, there's a fairly good chance you're not going to die at all.
You have orders, too.
Yes, sir, as a final note, I'd like to say, fuck our orders, fuck Ramelle, fuck the cheese capital of France and while we're at it, fuck Private James Ryan.
I don't like that one.
But we accomplish the mission.
ON THE BRIDGE!  WE'RE COMING IN.
See to it.
I coach the baseball team, too.
FIRES a burst.  More Germans drop.
Looks at Miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway.  He gently tries to move Miller aside.
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, my grandfather got old, as grandfathers tend to do. He needed someone to take care of him.  We move around all the time, going from one mine to another, so we had to put him in a home.  Nice enough place but kind of depressing. But not for Granddad.  He just convinced himself he was on a cruise ship, going to Tahiti, he had his own cabin, first class, with room service.  It just so happened that the weather was always lousy, so he never bothered to go up on deck. Happiest guy you ever saw until the day he died.
I care.  Don't you know what Caen's famous for, Sarge?
We know.
He's fast, Captain, I saw him.
Goddamn it...Goddamn it...Goddamn it...
Since I was nine years old.  They got a lot of explosives around mines. Me and my little brother could get into any warehouse you ever saw. Damn, we had fun!
Twenty-four-five.
We believe that your father operates in a large pool of cash that comes from phoney billings, phoney patients.  We've been investigating him for five years.  We believe that when they die, he takes their money.
And your former wife.
For going to school?
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
C'mon Lloyd.
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
Read it.
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
Alright.
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
We'll worry about that later.  Now come on, tell me that you're special.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
You're going.
Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care.  Give him this pen.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
Hi.
Diane, I do have a history with this man, and it's not the greatest.  I see you so seldom, I'd really rather know about you.
You know, I don't even know if you've got a young man in your life?
Alright.
Okay.  Oh, here's Ray.  Just talk to him because when you don't, your mouth turns down.
Yeah?
Yeah.
No tips.  I won't give you any tips of any kind.
Eight.
Goodbye.
No.
Yeah.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
They knew of you.  Now they know you.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
Twisted?
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
Come on.
Really?  Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
What did you say?
Friends with potential.
Right.
Oh.  I was putting the...
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
No, we don't have to say it.
No, I don't, I don't.
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
No I didn't.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Oh shit.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I love you.
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
You've gotta get her out of your head, man.
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
No.
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
Oh.  Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Yeah.  Honey?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
I'm totally and completely serious.
So what's up?
Your car?
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings.  I mean, there's no possible way.
How you doin', brother?
Thanks a lot Lloyd.
I don't know.
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
I love you too.
How do you do?  What can I get you, what're you drinking?
Now I'm back, and you know what I'm going to do now?  I'm going to have a good time.  So are you.
He's on the list.  If he were an essential worker, he would not be on the list. He's on the list.  You can't have him.
My plant manager is somewhere on this train. If it leaves with him on it, it'll disrupt production and the Armaments Board will want to know why.
Oskar, please -
A charade?  How could it be a charade?
I'm sorry to hear that.
I'd love to, it'll have to wait until I get back.  I have to leave.
Well, you've been through it.  You know. You could make things easier for me.
He's important to my business.
I want him.  Come on, let's go inside, let's have a good time.
They're taking mine.  When I said they didn't have a future I didn't mean tomorrow.  Auschwitz.
I don't know.  Soon.
It's good business.
It's good for me - I know them, I'm familiar with them.  It's good for you - you'll be compensated.  It's good for the Army.  You know what I'm going to make?  Artillery shells.  Tank shells. They need that.  Everybody's happy.
Look it up.
Takes diamonds to stay on this list.
Nice things cost money.
How should I know?  It's broken. See what you can do.
Wine?
The Jewish worker's salary, you pay it directly to the SS, not to the worker. He gets nothing.
Thank you.
Oskar -
You don't?  I do.  I see a difference.
There will be generations because of what you did.
There's taking money and there's taking money, you know that.  He's taking money.
The killer was trying to get to her. That sorority girl was a distraction.
That doesn't work, sir.
I won't.
Alright, alright...I'll call you back.
Stop it...
I'm losing you.
I'm inquisitive.
Don't forget to set the alarm.
Look, yesterday wasn't my idea. That was all Gale and dollar signs and ratings.
I wish it was just a year. I lost everything because of you. I have nothing now. Look at me, this is what I've become. A long silence. Sidney is hanging on by threads.
What?
It’s over, Cotton.
Job hazard. Debbie Salt, stringer-- NEWSWEEK. Answer a few questions?
What are you doing here? I thought you had retired from field reporting?
And much richer as a result.
Tons and tons.
Finish what my son started.
Enter Cotton Weary.
Yeah.
Sid, you don't have to.
I'll get my jacket.
I think it's out of your control.
It's not you, Derek. I don't trust myself. I tend to make big selection errors when it comes to men.
So you'll relieve me at 2:30...
I read her postings on the horror movie chat boards and fell hopelessly. Hook, line...
Until now.
The way I see it. We’ll be arrested. Go to prison. Cash in on the home footage. Secure a book deal. If all goes as planned, our trial should coincide with the release of STAB II.
And we didn’t want to do that, Sid. We wanted to give you your money’s worth.
Tuition’s expensive.
I'm on crowd patrol, Miss Weathers, excuse me.
I see you read the book.
Page 41. "Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience."
How do you know my dim-witted inexperience isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation used to lower people's expectations thereby enhancing my ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation?
I think you're all an act.
Meaning?
Solid alibis. He was with Sidney when she was attacked.
What are we looking for?
Dewey, you and I would never make it.
Over here.
No, wait here.
No. I will not crawl under a rock. This is a fucked-up world and people kill people all the time. I'll just get used to it.
Don't worry...
It's hell week. I'm pledging the Deltas.
But I love you. And I want the whole world to know it.
Please, I have the perfect excuse.
I've got my entourage. Take a break. Please.
I'd really just like to be alone.
It's not a good idea, Hallie.
Her old boyfriend?
Thanks, Joel.
But...
..we only promote safe rubbered sex.
Gale?
But...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry but I had to. It was too easy.
Where you going?
I'm sorry, Sid, please. I never should have gone along with Gale. I know I'm stupid. I wish I had some good reason to give you but I'm just stupid. Please, Sid, don't be mad at me.
Well, yeah...she gave me a job. Freelance. It got me outta Woodsboro. I'm sorry about Cotton and yesterday. It was a bad idea. I knew it was a bad idea but it seemed like a quasi harmless bad idea. Ah, shit, Sid, I'm fucked up. Sidney looks at him Long and hard, a smile slowly appearing.
And that CICI chick wasn't that bad either but I'm really concerned about my safety now.
I mean, I'm standing right outside the LADIES ROOM door at the PLAZA THEATER. Your girlfriend Christine is in there.  She's all alone. Everyone's in the auditorium waiting for the film to start.  I've got my knife.
Does the name Maureen Prescott sound familiar to you?
I'm sorry Miss Weathers. Allow me to introduce myself, MARK KINCAID, L.A.P.D.  Are you familiar with the actor Ben Damon, or the actress CHRISTINE PERKINS?
Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.
I'd love to help, really I wouldn't mind being sliced at again by a maniacal psychopath, but I honestly don't know where Sidney is. After Windsor she dropped off the face of the Earth. The only other person that might know is, , not going to talk.
Look, Miss Weathers, if there's a problem, give me a call. Here's my card. I'm always there.
Deal, but I'm still Detective Kincaid,ok?
But we know who killed Maureen Prescott, Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.  I mean, they even told Sidney how they did it!
To me Hollywood is about death.
I know what it's like to see ghosts that don't Go away.  To be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not,  watching it alone.
Can't arrest ghosts.  But the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people.  You're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, Miss Prescott.
Understood.  If you'll excuse me Detective.  Gale.
What does this have to do with Sid?
When it's a threat, you'll know it.
What Rielly?
He could've monitored the calls on a scanner. Did you call her from the set?
And what made you think it was Sidney?
Listen, Detective, I wanna see this studio where all this shit's going down.
Mm, what a waste of Silicone.  What does my mother have to do with this all Dewey? We're a long way from Woodsboro.
Yes. Look, let's get something straight Dewey, I got into this shit cause the police came looking for ME. Not cause I'm out to make the SUNRISE STUDIOS SLASHINGS.
And?
Someone stole Sid's file?
Amen boy scout, now answer the fucking door!
Do you want us to come with you?
Roman, from your enthusiasm it certainly seems that way.  Honestly though,  tell us, what's	your favorite scary movie?
Sure.
What the hell are you doing?
Do you get any of my witty humor? I mean, you did play me for three movies.  His two hands, dingus.
Yeah.
I'm hanging up right now.
SCENE 32. INT. CANDY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT. "What are you talking about Ricky, the murders were a completely isolated incident".
Make-up. You need it.  Hey, Roman isn't here?
W-what do you want?
You sick fuck I'm tracing this call as we speak! The police are gonna nail your ass!
Great. A spirited one. I'll be seeing you real soon Sidney. Real soon.
Who is this?
Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you.
I'm sorry, your voice.
Piece of cake. She'll be there.
I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
It's an easy game. We ask you a question. If you get it wrong -- you die.
Except for me and Billy... we were left for dead...
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry. Don't hate me.
What are you doing here?
The police say I scared him off. It wasn't me, Sid.
Oh Sidney...
Are you serious?
Fuck you.
We did your mom a favor, Sid. The woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was Sharon Stone or something.
You have to have a favorite.
Guess.
Wait... I thought we were gonna go out.
Don't hang up on me.
I can't think.
Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH.
Answer the question and I will.
I know who you are, ma'am. How's the eye?
Well... uh... yes ma'am. For the time being.
You are precious. Please, call me Gale.
Mind if I join you?
I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
Oh, God, Sid, I'm sorry I was late.
Yes, you doofus.
I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go.
Sorry, police orders. I'll stay out of the way, I promise.
Not yet.
How is everything?
What were you doing out here?
Have to be. The shit she's gone through.
She'll be with her friends over at Stu Maker's tonight.
Call the police.
The phone's dead.
I can hear her. Oh Mother of God, I can hear her.
But it's so much easier when we make it up.
Just stay back.
Have you talked to Cotton?
He's lying. She wouldn't have touched him. He raped her, then butchered her. Her blood was all over his coat.
Ricki Lake.
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?
What's your favorite scary movie?
That is so unoriginal. You disappoint me, Randy.
Uh-huh.
If you hang up, you'll die just like your mother.
Who are you?
Sleep tight, sweetie.
Twice.
What are you saying? That I killed her or something?
Yeah, I'm off early -- curfew you know.  Now that's poor taste.
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.
Could be. Now that Billy's tried to mutilate her, you think Sid would go out with me?
I can cry on cue.
I'll be right back.
You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
Why are you doing this?
Do they know who did it?
They think it's school-related?
I'll be there by seven. I promise
Her dad's out of town. She's staying with us.
He was there, Tatum.
It was him, Tatum. I know it.
I don't know...
With Stu, there's little time to stop and reflect. But sometimes before, to relax and get in the mood, I think about Grant Goodeve.
Grant wrote the song himself. I'm convinced the lyrics had a secret meaning, "Eight is enough..."
Oh, Sidney. WHAT? A guy can talk tits til he's dead but the minute you mention an eight inch weenie. Watch out.
He wouldn't just turn himself in.  It doesn't make any sense.
So what?  This victim...
This can't be my last duty here.  It will go on and on.
I'll get a job, maybe on a farm.  I'll work on the house.
I heard.
He's not finished.
Put it down.  Put it on the ground.
Hello.
Why?
Her pretty head.
You'll see.
Not me.  I'm not special.  I'm not exceptional.  This is, though.  What I'm doing.
You know that's not true.
Now... I wouldn't do something like that, Johnny.  I like you.  I like you a lot.
You only killed a bunch of innocent people so you could get your rocks off.  That's all.
And, why is that?
Sit back.
All this effort you've made to get transferred, it's the first question that pops into my head.
Maybe I thought I could do more good here than there.  I don't know.  Look, it'd be great by me if we didn't start right off kicking each other in the balls.  But, you're calling the shots, Lieutenant, so... however you want it to go.
I made a decision, because I have to consider the integrity of the scene.  I can't worry whether you think you're getting enough time on the playing field.
Can we talk about this in private?
Detective Mills here.  Honey... I asked you not to call me here. I'll call you back...  What?  Why?
I'm invited to have a late supper at your house.  And, I accept.
I vaguely recall a large, angry man, and someone called Norton.
All day Saturday, and all day Sunday.  The murderer would want Gould to take his time.  To have to sit there and decide. Where do you make the first cut?  There's a gun in your face... but, what part of your body is expendable?
Nothing.
A switchblade.
It doesn't fit.  He doesn't want us to help him stop.
Oh, that's all.
Doesn't seem like our man, does it?
Never took a bullet.  I pulled my gun once. fired it once.
Sounds like he knew what he was talking about.
No kidding!  No fucking kidding!
No.
No.  He's not depending on luck.  You've seen that.  We walked into that apartment exactly one year after he first tied Victor to the bed, to the day.  To the day! Because he wanted us to.
Just because the bastard has a library card, it doesn't make him Einstein.
What does all that matter anyway?  It's not our job to figure him out, is it?  All we have to do is catching him.
How is this legal?
Yeah, well... at least we're out of the office.  We've got pizza.
We're focusing.
The Divine Comedy.  A History of Catholicism.  A book called Murderers and Madmen.
It was him.
What the fuck is wrong with you?
No point in arguing anymore...
These murders are his masterwork.  His sermon to all of us.  To all us sinners.
You're the oldest man I know, Somerset.
You do your job...
You follow the law and do the best you can. It's all there.
It wasn't one thing, if that's what you mean.  I just... I can't live here anymore. I can't live where stupidity is embraced and nurtured as if it were a virtue.
Wrong!  I sympathize completely, because if you can't win... then, if you don't ignore everything and everyone around you, you... you become like John Doe.  It's easier to beat a child than it is to raise it, because it takes so much work to love.  You just have to make sure you don't stop to think about the abuse, and the damage, because you'll risk being sad.  Keep ignoring.
That part of me is dead.
No, actually, I wasn't sure at all.
When do we get to question him?
You and I are, probably for the first time ever, in total agreement.  He wouldn't just stop.
He's only two murders away from finishing his masterpiece, right?  Can you even conceive of what's going to happen next?  I mean, can you even imagine how he'll try to finish it?
I will.
What are you talking about?  What happened?
I can't let you do this...
I... I don't understand.
I don't see anything.
I can't do this now... please.
It surprises me.  It really does.
You have to put blinders on sometimes. Most times.
Talk to him about it.  He'll understand if you tell him how you feel.
You should look into private schools.
I hate this city.
Crime of passion.
It's not a sword, ma...It's a sabre!  Did you kill many damYankees with this sabre, Uncle Ethan?
Stealing the cattle was just to pull us out...This here's a murder raid...  It shapes up to scald out either your place...or my brother's.
That'll be the day!...Let's ride.
Huh...? No...no water.
Why?  You wanted for a crime, Ethan?
I'm askin' as a Ranger of the sovereign state of Texas.
By what you preach...none!
...as you have of findin' those girls alive by ridin' into 'em... I say we do it my way, Ethan...and that's an order!
Just keep goin'...
That's all right, Captain...I don't need any formal invitation to kill a Comanch...
Comanches don't use their fists, reverend...Let 'em alone...
Now mount up, son...
Go ahead, son...But at the first alarm, we're comin' in -- and we ain't goin' to have time to pick and choose our targets when we do...
Captain Clayton...Captain!
Sir?
Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
Oh...Now what's this your pa wants to know?
But...but captain, we can't possibly take the field tomorrow...for your own protection...
We ain't goin'! We ain't goin' without you, Debbie...Ethan, get the horses...I'll try to keep her talkin'...
SURE!...They <U>WERE</U> here...Now they're out there...an' waitin' to jump us!...
Ay-eh...That's jest what I tole Joe Powers...That un's gettin' kinda sassy, ain't he, Ethan?
Swear it, Ethan?...Given word?
That camp you hit was Nawyecka Comanche...Chief Scar's bunch...
Don't have to call me 'sir' neither... Nor grampaw neither...Nor Methuselah neither...I can whup you to a frazzle.
Why, sure, Ethan...There's just the one thing we're after...finding Deborah and Lucy...
Must've...Anyway, I ain't goin' back to look for it...
I ain't stayin'...I set out lookin' for Debbie...I aim to keep on...
Because she's my...my...
I always felt like she was...Her folks takin' me in, raisin' me like one of their own...
What's that?
He just couldn't wait...
But I just bought a good blanket.
Oh no! Tell her she's got to go back...
Cut it out, will ya...
Peaceful tribes depend on the buffalo, too....
What'd the soldiers have to kill her for!..
We won't be here...Come on!
What's goin' on?
You don't remember it, but I remember. That was your mother's scalp!
That's the breed...Course it might take time.
I am...I am...It's just that I know Martha'd want you to think of her boys as well as her girls...And if the girls are...dead...Ethan, don't let the boys waste their lives in vengeance!
No...not yet...
From the beginning...
You talk like a feller might just as leave run around nekkid...
I can't help it, Laurie...I just gotta catch up with Ethan...
You crazy?
I got to fetch her home...
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
We're probably lucky that we even have running water and electricity! Damned box!
Do you have a better idea?
What?
Why not?  She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
We loved each other once.  Have you forgotten that?
'HE'?  Whom do you mean-
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
Thank you.
You know, I saw him sitting outside your gate...  Oh, I'm sorry, I'm forgetting my manners again!  I haven't even introduced myself yet. Hi, my name's Lindner. Karl Lindner.
A tumor - which could cause pressure on certain parts of the brain and, thus, influence your perception.
I've killed my husband!
I think I've killed him.  Martin, my husband, I've killed him!  That is, I'm not sure, but...
He was the first man among us. A great light has gone out.
Right you are, governor!
Lady?
Romeo?--he gave it to Henslowe.
Ask him.
No Juliet?!
When I have fifty pounds.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
Ten pounds.
Ned is wrong for it.
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Yes, but very well.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
Who are you?
Every word.
Fifty pounds? What for?
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Yes. Nearly.  It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
I did not.
No, it will turn out well.
I don't know, it's a mystery.
How will it?
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
The daughter of his enemy.
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
No, no, a touch of cold only. We suspect he is lying but WILL has turned away.
"Ay pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer."
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes; And but thou love me, let them find me here.
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
Oh. What is your name?
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
My lord.
But why me?
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat.  Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
Serve.
Will you shut up and play.
It's true. A newspaper is paying for all this. A newspaper...
Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
I'm only asking you both to think about it.
But don't tell me that you're not tempted by it. Don't tell me that you're not interested. I know you well enough.
Then what? Who's going to do what?
Do I? What? What? What are you talking about?
We all are, David, we're all going to do it. Each of us, you, me and Juliet, will do his or her bit. Is that fair enough?
You're telling me you want out? Already? You're telling me you don't want the money? Hugo is going off. He smells. The flat smells. We can't wait any longer.
Look, if I draw the short straw, then I'll do it, but I'm not going to do it just because you won't.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Security.
Secure it? What do you mean -- you're gong to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank? You're not going to take it to a bank Or what, you want to bury it? Is that it?
Your friends.
Yeah, I was phoning your mother.
It's all right. I'll forward your mail.
Yeah?
Where do you think you'll go?
I bought the tickets. One for her and one for me. It was my idea.
I don't know anything about it.
But there's no --
What does it look like?
What?
What?
Yes, thanks.
Cameron?
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
Just serve.
She hated you --
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
Yes.
I thought we all were.
But you're a doctor. You kill people every day.
I want my money back. Excuse me.
For ever and ever.
Who was it?
It tastes different.
Your painful groin?
Oh, good.
And the money?
That's what I thought he said.
I see.
did you hear anything before he cries?
Well, if you do, you'll let us know?
And the other three people on the flat, did they hear anything?
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
I'm sorry.
Two hundred pounds?
You paid two hundred pounds for this?
No, no, no. That's what you paid for it. Two hundred pounds is what you paid for it. We don't know what it cost us yet, for you two to have a good time, we don't know the cost of that yet.
Sorry?
Not any real sneering as such, no.
That guy, the one that died.
That's what I thought.
You must be Juliet.
Well, I've been away for a bit, travelling, that sort of thing, and now I'm trying to write a novel.
I'm a doctor.
But in your work you must meet lots of different people, every day -- new people, new faces. No?
Like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Excellent. DC Mitchell is a rising star, Mr. Stevens. Under my tutelage he will undoubtedly make the grade.
It's like recognizing criminals by their crimes.
Is it real?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
Who?
Yes, but... I thought...
It's just -- fabulous.  Think you could do anything for me?
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
What?
What kind of treatment?
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
It isn't?
Okay.
Yeah.
No thanks.
Why do you wanna know so bad?
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
I never get my hair done.
You think that's funny, don't you?
I am not!
Right.
She is.
Great.
Well, yeah... you know.
Look, Mr. Roundy, why don't you make out a financial statement? It'll save us both some time. Miss Michaels here can show you... have it notarized and we'll see where we go from there. Miss Michaels, would you get me a couple of forms?
Buffums?
Probably the bathroom.
I'd cut it...
Whew.
Yeah... wow.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
Yeah, baby...
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
I am you, you little bastard.
Nothing.
-- do you want ice?
Lester's on his way.
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
What?
-- Oh yeah.
Otis is dead.
-- oh -- sweetheart...
-- yeah, this is --
Okay... thanks...
Hey, stop by the shop.
No shit?
What?
Honey, what happened?
I am?
Yeah, baby.
Of course I like children.
Okay, baby. Okay...
Okay.
Yeah, baby.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
I'll call you.
A business meeting, I told you that.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
I do, Jill.
What is.
I'm very tired, George.
Let go of me.
Oh, Christ.
Where did this come from?
That's all you've got to say?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
Did you?
Thank you.
Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
Isn't that bad for it?
Now wait a minute...
But...
Oh Jesus Christ.
What, do you think I planned it?
Didn't they tell you?
... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
I know.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
Yeah.
I'll call you back.
What do you mean?
Okay.
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
You do?
Is that right?
George is going to open a shop.
Who do you think I was talking to?
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
Really? How about starting with tonight?
Fine.
Why not?
I'll call you.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I know, I'm sorry.
Don't be silly.
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
Didn't you have any panties on?
Sure.
He's a hairdresser.
-- oh I don't know --
-- just wonderful.
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
What was the Donner party?
You mean they ate each other up?
Come here for a minute, first.
Does your Mum and Dad know about Tony?
Do they know he tell you things?
What about Room 237?
Mr. Halloran, what is in Room 237?
Danny, come on over here.
No.
Not right now, Daddy's asleep.
Okay, Mom.
Are you having a bad dream?
Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.  Red Rum.
Danny, come here!
Danny!
Yes.
Thank you.
Mrs. Torrance, most of the time these episodes with kids are never explained.  They are brought on by emotional factors, and they rarely occur again.
Well how can I repay you?
Yes, sir.
And, er... where are they now?
A nigger.
Your son has a very great talent. I don't think you are aware how great it is, but he is attempting to use that very talent against your will.
Grady... oh.
Your wife appears to be stronger than we imagined, Mr. Torrance. Somewhat more resourceful, she seems to have got the better of you.
Thank you very much.  I'll do that.
Hallo, this is Dick Halloran again. I called a while ago about the folks at the Overlook Hotel.
Oh, that's just great.  How do you folks like our hotel so far?
It will be a pleasure.  Right this way Mrs. Torrance.
Doc.  You called Danny 'Doc' twice just now.
Things could be better, Lloyd. Things could be a whole lot better.
I love it.  I really do.  I've never been this happy, or comfortable anywhere.
Yes.
Yes.
I don't think that's true.  I think you have some very definite ideas about what should be done with Danny... and I'd like to know what they are.
When do you think maybe he should be taken to a doctor?
I'm not going to hurt you.
Stop swinging the bat.
Put the bat down, Wendy.
Give me the bat.
Go away.
Wendy...
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic.
Well...
Well, that sounds fine to me.
They'll love it.
Well, my predecessor in this job
shut in together over long periods of time.
put off by the idea of staying alone in a place where something like that actually happened.
Well, it's very... homely.
Oh well he sure did a beautiful job. Pink and gold are my favorite colors.
I don't accept the idea that he knows who his letter writer is, Jane. Because I don't accept the idea that there was a big bad wolf who saw Marty in his wheelchair.
I don't know. Maybe he doesn't know, either.
Sure, Uncle Al.
If you don't stop it I'm going to vomit. I mean it.
Jane, I have to talk to you.
Will you?
All except my legs... I don't think I can walk.
What kind of noises?
No.
A bunch of men getting ready to pretend they're Clint Eastwood... Marty, didn't anybody ever tell you that the only monsters are in comic books and drive-in movies?
I'll give you the telephone numbers of my ex-wives, dear boy- they'll be interested to hear that.
But you are, you know- you are my dear boy.
She and dad are out back lighting the barbecue. Jane's walking around like she's King Shit of Turd Mountain. Like always.
I don't get you.
Sure.
Yeah, I know. It's great!
What the hell does that matter?
Watch it, dear boy. I think it was a hallucination. Probably a broomstick, or something.
I didn't shoot him when he was a man. I shot him when he was-
I told you!
What about Father Lowe chasing me in his car and trying to run me down? You don't think that was a dream, do you?
Marty, the moon wasn't even full!
Dear boy, you have gone right out of your mind.
Really?
LET THY THOUGHTS BE GUIDED
LET THY SOUL BE HEALED
SING!
SING!
Hey, Sisters.  Are you going in there?
What did who say?
You did what?
You want me to go against a priest?  Get excommunicated?  You think I'm nuts?
You lying sleazeball!  The best years of my life!  What am I, garbage?  Am I lint?
That used to be true, Vince.  I was with you.  But something happened.  And I'm different now.  Real--different.  I've had, well, you might call it -- a religious experience.  And I've got just two words for you.  And those two words are...
Oh-huh.
Oh my! 
Yes, Betty?
D00-LANG, DOO-LANG, D00-LANG.
But don't you get money?  From the Vatican?
Mary Clarence, could you?  Mary Lazarus, you're terrific, but...  Could you help us?
No way.  We're a choir, right? Headliners.  The big room.  Two days a week won't cut it.  Every day.
So use it.  When we sing hymns, they're usually about rejoicing, right? Celebration.  Most music is.  So don't hold back.  Let all that joy go right into your voice.  Make me happy.  Let me hear it.  Perk out.  Perk down.
That man -- who is he?
Get moving.  I'm right behind you.
What a shame!
Whatever.
That's true, wouldn't that be great.  Of course, we never know when things are going to change.  Any one of us could be transferred to another convent, tomorrow.
Sing!
Three years.  Sister.
It's part of St. Katherine's new community outreach program.  How old are you?  You shouldn't be smoking.  Have you ever seen a diseased lung?  Hand 'em over.
You watch yourself!
Good point.  Especially that dude you were with.  I'd like to see him down front.
Experience!
Give me a C.  A C!
Oh no.  We'll always be together.
Again?
She's got nothing to do with this.  Let her go.
What did He say?
Enough joking.
Parochial school.  Akron.  St. Android's.
Are you talking about me?
You mean black people?
Would you like that?
Can do.
Normally dressed, you are a sore thumb, and you endanger us all.  While you are here, you will conduct yourself as a nun. Only I shall know who, and what, you truly are.  You will not disrupt the convent.  You will not influence the Sisters with your colorful street talk. You will draw no attention to yourself in any way.
No problem.
Silence?  No talking?  All day?
From all I've heard, just about everything.  Your singing career seems all but nonexistent, and your married lover wants you dead. 
Mary Clarence!
You are correct.  Sometimes prayer alone cannot help a situation.  Such as your own, for example.  How do you feel about physical labor?
Do your recall the words of Saint Peter, in Ecciesiastes 1:27?  He spoke unto a wastrel youth.  He said, "Take up thy task, and know ye the path of contentment."
But you can't kick me out!  Guys want to kill me!  You're a nun!  A big nun! Aren't you supposed to have compassion? For the wayward sheep?  I mean, I'm a major sinner!  All-time great!  Hall of Fame!  Aren't I, like, your dream come true?  Your Olympic event?
What do you mean?
I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
You have a phone call.
I have submitted my resignation to Bishop O'Hara.  Privately.  I have asked to be relocated as soon as possible.
Indeed.  After how long?  A few weeks? I have been here thirty years.  And yet, it would seem, I know nothing.
I'm a Christian.
'Cause you're always out, arresting people.  Making trouble.  I don't know why I went out with you in the first place, it was embarrassing!  I couldn't hold my head up, I used to tell people you were a security guard!
A what? When are you qonna wake up?
Information, baby.  I thought maybe somebody around here might have a conscience.
You couldn't believe it?  Vince the Prince?
Then-you run.
You'd lose.  You'd die.  All over the sidewalk.  And into the street.
Get a stenographer.
Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are.
You're supposed to be hiding out!
I've been worried about you.
No.  Most of the time I'm thinking about you.  And now... you've really changed.
You re sort of... radiant.   your eyes are shining.  You're rea1ly different...
What?
You don't get it!  It's a big thing for them, it's like... Caesar's Palace. Prime-time.  They're singing for the Cardinals.  It's like... "Star Search." If first prize was a trip to the Vatican. They've worked really hard, they deserve this.
Oh-huh.
You won't even tell us?
You found him -- but we're not open yet.
Which one!
Willy -- hit the lights.
Where is she?
That should have tipped us.
Reverend Mother, on behalf of the sisters, I'd like to welcome Mary Clarence to St. Katherine's.
However, we can also pray for other things.
It's better than ice cream.
She's our inspiration!
And therefore an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.
St. Katherine's is a Benedictine Order. You have taken a Vow of Hospitality.  To all in need.
And you'll face that danger head-on.  As if I could stop you.  And you have my complete support in this matter. Anything you can do to revitalize this neighborhood would be a blessing.
Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town.  What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death?
What are you spying on?
Bring him.
I cannot proceed without examining the previous victims.
No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say.
I am the Lord's voice in this town.
You cannot do this.  I am a man of God!
When a goblin leaps from the nether world, others follow.  Poltergeists of the air, water and earth follow and cheer his desecrations!
No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards...
Up.
What kind of nuts?
Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business.
Father said witches live there.
And it now belongs to you, according to Baltus.  I heard him say it.
Baltus Van Tassel.
There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  "Paasch, James" "Pieter, Thomas" "Pos, William."
Lady Van Tassel.
Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements?
It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her.  It is absolutely nothing.
Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly.
I need time for thinking.  Without you hanging on my coattails for a change.
Take me with you.  There's nothing left for me here.
I doubt that's the end.
Feel free to form your own opinion.  Though it appears you already have.
Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was "no" at least once.
Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman.
There is no such thing as magic.
May I ask... why do you cover your book that way?
You made this, and the drawings?
That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before.
If these are the random stalkings of a monster, what good am I?
No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh...
You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes.
If it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it.  Not for a moment.  So, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours.  And someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust Sleepy Hollow out of its slumber.
She died.  Her lungs were diseased... two years ago.  What is this about?
He... he tries to take the heads... they will not pass.
Keep climbing.  I will follow...
I can show exactly.
No one will believe your lies, whore.
May I see my mother?
No, sir, please... she is innocent...
Wait up, I'll leave with you and lock up.
See there. Thinks of the simplest thing first.
Good to see you, Bill. How's everybody doin'?
What do you like to eat here?
They was a boy. We made friends.
Ain't that the sweetest thing. What am I supposed to do about supper with you traipsin' around with that fag?
See, you made him somethin'. Hey Vaughan, I was just goin' on with you, jokin' around, buddy.
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
Don't tell me what to do.
What do you want, hun?
I get nervous, that's all I know.
Karl can stay if he wants to. Mama said --
Shhhh! This is the national anthem.
This and that. Toothpaste and whatnot.
How does a feller go about gettin' ahold of the police?
I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
I killed some folks quite awhile back. They said I wadn't right in the head and they put me in there in the nervous hospital instead of puttin' me in jail.
I never was much count at it. I never did get picked out fer it.
I was kindly needin' to do some tradin'. Reckon they sell toothpaste?
You ort not to talk that way. You're just a boy.
That gal that made employee of the month give 'em to me for awalkin' with her.
All right then.
All right then.
If you want me to.
He ain't no count.
Naw.
My daddy come to the shed out back and got me and said throw this here away and handed me a towel with somethin' in it. I went for the trash barrel there and opened up the towel to see 'cause they was a noise and somethin' movin' in it. Hit was bloody-like around that towel. Hit was a little ol' bitty baby, no bigger than a squirrel.
A little ol' boy.
I didn't feel right about doin' that. I takened a shoe box from there in the shed and emptied out some screwdrivers and nuts and warshers from it and put the little feller in that and buried him in the corner of the yard there. That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.
Hits been hard thinkin' about it. They ain't a day goes by I don't think about it. I kindly have a picture of it up in my head that I see. Hit makes me sad, too. I have bad thoughts on it. I wished they was somethin' I could of did, too. Shouldn't no bad things happen to childern. All the ol' bad things ort to be saved up for folks that's growed up, the way I see it. I shouldn't of told you about that. A boy ort not hear about such things. It just kindly come out.
Yes sir, I reckon it does.
I don't reckon I know. I ain't found no way yet and I'm three or four times as old as you. Might be that's just the way folks is.
I dern near had me a touchdown till them boys got a-hold of me there so I figured I better give it off to you. I seen you over there follerin' me.
Yes ma'am. I like a fried chicken leg.
You don't want to give away all your books.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop.  He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Doyle wouldn't really kill you, would he?
I reckon.
Me, too.
I ain't got no boy.
You better go get your things.
Naw.
Yes sir.
My history.
That boy, he's my friend. He likes the way I talk and I like the way he talks.
No ma'am.
It's all right.  You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Yes ma'am.  I like your garage.  I wouldn't never hurt you or your boy. I'd lay my hand on the Bible and say the same thing.
I could shore use some. Thank ye.
You're a good mama to that boy. You care for him. You work hard fer him to take care of him. You light him up in his eyes, I've seen it. He wouldn't know what to do without ye.
You've been real good to me, too. It ain't ever'body that'd make biscuits in the middle of the night. You and that boy has give me a good feelin'.
I reckon Mr. Woolridge got me hired on to work for Bill Cox's outfit.
Not really to speak of.
So, you're really going to stay here?
I know.
Signs?
I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
I wouldn't actually call it a party. It's more along the lines of a dinner in celebration of my birthday.  The guest list is quite restricted. So far, there's Mr. Benjamin and myself. If you accept, that would make three of us.
Better make it charge. 
I confess.
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Yeah, well, I've sort of been out of commission.  How's Melville?
For me?  I'll have the same thing. 
What's that, Sol?
What's the difference?
Uh, sure, Sol. Anything you say. Instead of saying, "One corned beef sandwich," and then, "Another corned beef sandwich," I'll say, "Two corned beef sandwiches."
You run out of Schimmelpennincks?
Yeah, I did.
Well, let's not exaggerate. I take pictures. You line up what you want in the viewfinder and click the shutter. No need to mess around with all that artisto crap.
It can be arranged. Seeing as how I've read your books. I don't see why I shouldn't share my pictures with you.  It would be an honor.
It's my project. What you'd call my life's work.
He's crazy.
We'd better be. I haven't spent a night out of Brooklyn in fourteen years, and I'm not about to break my record now. Besides, I've got to be on my corner at eight sharp tomorrow morning.
Hi, Auggie.
Uh, better make it one.
Yeah, I know, but I'm trying to cut down.  Somebody's worried about my health.
Take over the register while I'm gone, okay, Jimmy? 
Okay.  You remember how you once asked me how I started taking pictures? Well, this is the story of how I got my first camera. As a matter of fact, it's the only camera I've ever had. Are you following me so far?
I guess so. I never thought of it that way.
Anything for art, eh, Paul?
I mean, it's a good story.
Exactly. Life just wouldn't be worth living, would it?
I don't want to talk about it.  If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything.  And besides, it's not for me.  It's for our daughter.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen.  She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant.  I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
It means "happiness."
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
Bully for you.
Why don't you open it and find out?
For keeps.
I try not to, anyway. It's better for your health. I mean, look at you, Vincent. You're the guy with the wife and three kids and the ranch house on Long Island. You're the guy with the white shoes and the white Caddy and the white shag carpet. But you've had two heart attacks, and I'm still waiting for my first.
Okay, my man. Love to the wife and kids, et cetera, et cetera. Drop me a postcard if you can remember the address.
This way, gentlemen. Let's retire to my office, shall we?
What is this, some kind of joke?
You're a dumb, whacked-out little fuck, do you know that?
Look, lady, that's enough. If you don't calm down. I'm going to throw you out. Do you hear me? Right now!
I'm not going to rob you, mister.  Do I look like a thief?
Is there a benefits package, or are you hiring me on a freelance basis?
You know, health insurance, dental plan, paid vacation. It's not fun being exploited. Workers have to stand up for their rights.
An ugly piece of hardware, isn't it?  I'll tell you what happened to my arm.  I'll tell you what happened.  Twelve years ago, God looked down on me and said, "Cyrus, you're a bad, stupid, selfish man. First of all, I'm going to fill your body with spirits, and then I'm going to put you behind the wheel of a car, and then I'm going to make you crash that car and kill the woman who loves you. But you, Cyrus, I'm going to let you live, because living is a lot worse than death. And just so you don't forget what you did to that poor girl, I'm going to rip off your arm and replace it with a hook. If I wanted to, I could rip off both your arms and both your legs, but I'm going to be merciful and just take off your left arm. Every time you look at your hook, I want you to remember what a bad, stupid, selfish man you are. Let that be a lesson to you, Cyrus, a warning to mend your ways."
That boy's one in a million. A real tiger.
Louisa Vail. Remember her, Cyrus?
I don't got no daddy, you dig? I got born last week when some dog fucked you up the ass.
Come on. At least let me buy you a cup of coffee.
In Manhattan?
Then what are you doing in Park Slope? It's a little far from home, isn't it?
Nice drawing. Did you do that?
Is your father an artist?
Yeah, sometimes.  I like to dabble, too.
I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
No hard feelings, okay? It's a small place, and I can't get my work done with you around.
Do you need some money? Some extra clothes?
Take good care of yourself, okay?
Business appointment. I'm seeing my broker at three o'clock.
Fair enough. We wouldn't want to get carried away, would we?  Now call your aunt Em and let her know you're alive.
It's my birthday. I'm seventeen years old  as of forty-seven minutes ago, and I think I should celebrate having made it this far.
I just did.
Absolutely. We would be honored.
That's just it. I didn't think. I just did it.
That's it. In a nutshell.
That money is my whole future.
It was more complicated than that. There was a reason.
He was out five thousand bucks, he said.... He kept saying it over and over.... Five thousand bucks down the drain.... He wouldn't stop.... Five thousand bucks, five thousand bucks.... He was like out of his mind with those five thousand bucks....
Good. I'm glad that's settled!
It's all right. I really do know them.
Now ask him who his mother was.
You don't.
Their kids was born here.  So when the oldest, that one there, was twenty...last payment gets made, and he could own it.
It's a joke.  Maneuver up to Carl's boat?  Tie your lines fast?  Come aboard?  All against Carl's will? It's the stupidest suggestion I ever heard of.
Couldn't get on the boat.  I'd just <u>shoot</u> the feller.  <u>Then</u> tie up, throw him inta th' drink.  And skip bein' the first gill-netter in history to make a successful forced boarding.
No sense to have <u>any</u> at all., even the right size.  It's like having an extra battery in the trunk of your car.  Nobody does.
All right, what if the defendant <u>heard</u>?  So Carl <u>let</u> him aboard, to help.  And <u>then</u> the fishing gaff?
Well, what if?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
It'll be over soon.  I can get you money.
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
Those aren't the facts that matter.
What else?  I had the boy teach me kendo.  Including...the importance of the bow.
Nossir.  I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
Pretty darn clear.
I said that if I was playing Sherlock Holmes...I'd maybe look for a... Japanese person.  With a bloody gun- butt.  A right-handed fella, to be precise.
My expertise.  Is that I'm a journalist.
He didn't want to lose any more.
That's how journalists.  Answer questions.
That's curious.  I was <u>appealing</u> to their intelligence.
Oh, yeh.  But this is nine year ago, I had my healt, I wasn't wantin' to sell.
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided <u>not</u> not come forward.
I slept til one-thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news.  We talked for a few hours.  I left at six and went straight to my boat.
Yes.
Three kids.  What's she going to do?
Won't take two.
To my father.  Everything counts.
Fell.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
But you <u>could</u> be wrong.  He <u>could</u> have climbed up earlier.
The knife.  What knife?
I'll take two.  One for later.
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there.  In a half hour you could be in Canada.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask.  If you did it.
Two D-6's.  That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Apparently.
Possible.  But not darn likely.
Your report says death by <u>drowning</u>, which means he went into the water alive and breathing.  And the report is accurate...?
But you are <u>certain</u> that he died by drowning.
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand.  The report says 'recent origin'.  How recent?  As much as 24 hours before death?
Such as?
Bye.
Get lost, will you?
All right, girls - from the top again.
Fresh!

A what?
What did he say?
How can you be so selfish?  We owe back rent - we're in four eighty-nine bucks to Moe's Delicatessen - we're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the laundry - we've borrowed money from every girl in the line -
First thing tomorrow we're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning.
He's a shoo-in.  I got the word from Max the waiter - his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit -
Quiet - I'm thinking.
We're not too late, are we?
Knock it off, will you?
As far away as possible.
Shave our legs, stupid.
Must be the way their weight is distributed. Come on.
Quit stalling.  We'll miss the train.
I never did like the name Geraldine.
Listen, stupe - no butter and no pastry. We're on a diet!
I just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive.  There'll be no buzzing around tonight.
It's not my fault.  I didn't invite them.
I got pinched in the elevator.
I watched you two on the bus - lovey-dovey - whispering and giggling and borrowing each other's lipstick -
Don't get burned, Daphne.
Yes, Mr. Fielding - you'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat - goodbye - what's that you said?  Oh - zowie! I'll give her the message. 
He's going to be ashore with you.
I'm just borrowing them.  You'll get them back tomorrow.
Have I got things to tell you!
Security.
Oh, I don't expect it to last.  I'll tell him the truth when the time comes.
Naturally.  You think my fiance is a bum? Now I guess I'll have to give it back.
So?  It's going to break Sugar's heart when she finds out I'm not a millionaire.  That's life.  You can't make an omelette without breaking an egg.
Nag, nag, nag.  Look, we got a yacht, we got a bracelet, you got Osgood, I've got Sugar - we're really cooking.
What do you mean, your bracelet? It's our bracelet.
Don't worry.  We did the right thing with it.
Terribly sorry.
I don't really have much of a voice - but then it's not much of a band, either.  I'm only with 'em because I'm running away.
I'll say.
If it hadn't been for you, they would have kicked me off the train.  I'd be out there in the middle of nowhere, sitting on my ukulele.
Sssh.  Sweet Sue.
We won't tell anybody - not even Josephine.
No.  It's nice and cozy.
No, no.
You got some?
I may spill something.
A bunch of us girls are going for a swim. Want to come along?
She'll rub it on me - and I'll rub it on her - and we'll rub it on each other - bye.
Just a little trick I picked up in the elevator.
Run along, Daphne - I'll catch up with you.
It sleeps twelve.  This is my friend Daphne. She's a Vassar girl.
Oh yes, we do!
Believe it or not - Josephine predicted the whole thing.
Yes.
I know what you need - a slug of bourbon.
And talk about elegant - you should see the yacht - candlelight - mint sauce and cranberries.
Yes.  For a whole year.
The Florida job?
You're the wrong shape.  Goodbye.
- you got to be blonde -
Help yourself.
Thank you.  Aren't you a sweetheart?
You don't say.
Well, pull in your reel, Mr. Fielding. You're barking up the wrong fish.
Bull fiddle.
Wanna bet?
Why?
No, thank you.  I'll walk.
Flower girl.
Oh, no you don't!  Look, Osgood - I'm going to level with you. We can't get married at all.
And I smoke. I smoke all the time.
We're just a couple of musicians - we come to pick up a car - Nellie Weinmeyer's car - there's a dance tonight -  Come on, Jerry.
Oh, it's you!  You got a lot of nerve -
The minute we get a job, I'm going to take you out to the swellest restaurant -
It's three weeks in Florida -
It's not the backs that worry me.
You got to be under twenty-five -
William Morris!
There are two things I will not put up with during working hours.  One is liquor - and the other one is men.
Where did he conduct?
No, just dumb.  If I had any brains, I wouldn't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls' band.
You see, I have this thing about saxophone players.
Every time!
But you're a girl, thank goodness.
So you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job, and the next saxophone player, and it's the same thing all over again.  See what I mean? - not very bright.
What's in Florida?
Well, now that you've mentioned it -
Bienstock.  He snores to beat the band. We cut cards to see who sleeps over him, and I always lose.  Wouldn't you know?
Good night, Sugar.
She doesn't need one.  I don't have one either.
Would you mind moving just a little? You're blocking my view.
For your own amusement?
It's been delightful meeting you both.
What?
Mother keeps hers in Southampton - and Dad took his to Venezuela - the company is laying a new pipe line.
Of course.  On Thursdays, they always serve me in the small salon.
It's all right for a bachelor.
Oh - a member of the herring family.
Trophies.  You know - skeet-shooing, dog-breeding, water polo...
I'll say.  I had two ponies drowned under me.
Well, I don't know how to put it - but I have this thing about girls.
Oh, you couldn't possibly.
How can you think about food at a time like this?
All right - if you insist.
Lets throw another log on the fire.
Eight hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
From a rich millionaire.
Quite a while.  As a matter of fact, I'm not coming back at all.
According to our tax advisers, she's only so-so.  But - that's the way the oil gushes. A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders - all those little people who invest their life savings -
Not always.  But I want you to know I'm very grateful for what you did for me.
That's right - pour it on.  Talk me out of it.
I come to the old lady's funeral.
Make is Scotch.  A demitasse. With a little soda on the side.
Who's going to raid a funeral?
Big joke.  Who's the rap this time?
Big joke!
What for?
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
Bacardi 151.
What? Why? What do you mean?
What for?
Actually, I do.
I knew you were still seeing someone else when we finally got together. I never in a million years would have dreamt it was Jeffrey.
Why, with you.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
Mom, please.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
No.
Oh, yes. Right. The Rat and Parrot.
Let me guess. Amy presumed I’d forget the rings.  I think I’m her least favorite person.  You know, I am sorry.
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That’s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
I don’t know.
On the nose.  I tell you what, because you’re so cute, I’ll take care of our incidentals.
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
That’s right. Imagine facing it alone.
Shampoo, got it!
What?!
I disappear. It’s not about me.
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
It’s my job.
I didn’t say he was worth it.
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you’ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Hi.
You knew?
Give it back? Are you nuts?
It’s complicated, Dad.
“...but it’s getting there. “
Close. Sydney. Turns out, I missed the rain.
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
Will do.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
David Lee Morgan. My dog's name is Sounder.  That feels better.
I try...
Sure--
What do that mean?
Me and my little sister, went down to the water hole, last Saturday--
:HE, JOSIE and EARL, running and playing in the field.
:His mother, with her head thrown back, her eyes aglitter and laughing.
NO! N-O, NO!
Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
Yes, sir...
"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"
I don't know, son -- they won't tell us things like that -- but I don't want y'all to come here no more.
Got it hurt in a dynamite blast, son. The dirty dogs had no more use for me, so they let me have time off my sentence, and let me come home.
Where was you, Daddy?
We goin' huntin' again, Daddy !?
I cleaned and oiled all your stuff while you was gone...
Mornin', Daddy...
September 4 -- how far away is that?
My father taught me...
Yes, David...
That's right!
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
Same as we -- they pray.
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
Listen, Mama...
Mama, don't I always do what you say -- every time I go to the fields to plant the corn, to Miss Boatwright's and the woods -- you tell me what to do and I do it, and you don't worry.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Yes, mam...
Did you find your father?
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
It's the heat.
He won't go mad -- he's just lookin' for a cooler spot.
Come in, children.
I'll walk...
I'm used to it.
Might be...
I wanta get some things.
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
I'll wait till after the children.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Can I finish? Please? Can I finish? ... ... Uh... Okay, I'm finished.
Pillow.
OW!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! THIS ISN'T FAIR!!! YOU SONS A BITCHE--
Fragile?
-No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
Maybe THAT'S who your father is, Cartman!
Sheet!
'Cuz, dude, it's all sticky and airy and fragile and stuff. I fucking hate it.
Yeah, I'm having total deja vu right now. Like this has all happened before...
Oh yeah?!  Well you're a monkey-shit-
I had to ride my bike here. My behind is killing me.
I have to say 'behind'! I get shocked if I say 'ass-  OW!!!
Yes, hon?
I saw him!! I saw Kenny!!
I bet him he couldn't set himself on fire and now he's all pissed off!!  AGH! I can't say pissed off?!  AGH!!
Eric, that is not appropriate.
Oh man, I'm gonna need a cherry pie to get the taste of ass out of my mouth from that piece of shit movie.
Uh, except for you Eric. I'm afraid you need to work more on not saying the F word and the N word.
Something big, children.
Oh no, it's that kid.
Be quiet, Ike! The movie's starting!
Uhh...
Mrph mprph!!
Uhh... I'm here for La Resistance.
Uhh... Bacon.
FREEZE!!
Time? Did time matter to the Revolutionists who were forced to eat their own shit while dying in the dungeons of ze King?
Where do they come up with this stuff?!
Yeah, let's swear we won't tell!
Our moms suck!
How do we do that?
Dude!  It's the V-chip!  It shocks him ever time he cusses!
Wow!
No, dude, all you have to do is hit the keys really fast and say a bunch of stupid shit and it works.
Me?!
What is 'fisting'?
Wake up, people!  We all have to do things that aren't pretty sometimes! It's the not pretty things that make life worth fighting the not pretty things for! Why do you think children have to be born in hospitals?
As Commander in chief, I have ordered our Army to set up defensive positions along the US-Canada border in anticipation of an attack.
Well find out where that signal is coming from!  Then hunt them down like dogs! Any and all Canadian influence must be stopped at all cost!
Oh no you don't! This is MY fight!! I don't need your help, Alan Dershwitz!
Oh.
Well, it looks like I'll have to send a warning letter out to parents. I have to put a stop to this before MORE children see 'Terrance and Phillip'.
Well, some of the children just don't respond to 12 step programs.
I don't care if it's dangerous! Desperate times call for desperate measures, Mr. Mackey. Perhaps I need to remind you of your situation.
Well, let's see... First of all, you fuck pigs.
My mother sent YOU a letter? What's it say?
YOU'D fuck your uncle!
The young boy that died lit himself on fire. It was unfortunate, but how can they blame US?
Yeah, God, no wonder your country is so fucked up.
You would know, dummy.
I know, Terrance.  This is quite the shitstorm we've found ourselves in this time.
I know, Terrance. I know.
Hey, come here, guy.
Do you always think about sex?  I'm talking about some very important stuff here!
Don't call me dumb!
Where're you gonna go, bitch? Besides, you know that if you left me, I'd hunt you down and kill you, right? I'm gonna go grab a drink.
Stan... I think you and I need some time apart.
Hi Stan.
What's the matter, Wendy?
God damn it, why does she keep saying that?
And the butfor?
He's shutting off the air!!!
It can't be.
Of course, of course...
Well I guess we're neighbors for this trip.
Very professional of you.
I was there.  Officer Taylor accessed my CPU directly to open the airlock doors.  They are not functioning properly.
Well it's a good thing that I did.
Trust me.  Even checked 'em with my own eyes.
Ain't it the truth. The two say nothing for a beat -
It's steady, good benefits.
Well, maybe I'll surprise you.
Transmit the code 3 emergency and take us offline.  Override the airlock sensors and hurry!  We're running out of time, we have to get to the pods!
You better start making sense!
We have the codes here.  How do you want to receive them?
Sure you do.  Sending Mac out on a little recon work.  How pathetic.  Problem is it seems Mac blew a few fuses.  Or maybe he's just a little drunk. Were you partying with a robot Taylor?
That's clear.
Sheesh!  Aye aye cap'n!
Yeah, I guess money don't buy class.
Like that piece of ass he was with.
Not me.  I'm in for the long haul. In nine months I'll have enough to take a few years off.
Will you shut up already?
That's right.
Yes.  Theoretical discoveries aside, there's nothing like the real thing. How about you?
Suppose you didn't have to hold your breath?
Close every door behind you!
Don't worry about me.  Where are we going?
One of Barnes' duds, luckily for us.  Take this out of the equation right now...
Sure.
Helllp!
A flare?  A flare won't do it.
I'm going to try and buy you some time.  I can get to the bridge from here.
I'm about to blow the wall.
We have room!  Let's go!
We don't have time.  I'll explain later, hurry!
And so far.
Good.  In that case, I pronounce us man and wife.
Well, there's no better to way to see the world, than with us.
Well if you need anything, please feel free to ask me.  Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available 24 hours in the earthrise room, and a large selection of vintage wines here in our ship bar.
He's up on the bridge!  He's going to be OK.  Now who's missing?
Look you were the one who wanted to do something different, something to tell all your friends.  Any chump can go to Nassau.
How am I supposed to know?
Talk to him...Jesus...
That will not be necessary.  You can simply speak to me.  I understand most languages fluently.
Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
I would recommend a maintenance crew in this sector.
You afraid we're gonna steal it?
How could you hate opera, Sid? Opera has all the drama and excitement of real life - to music!
It was a clearance.
Only problem is, you didn't put his lights out, you just got him mad. Then he took it out on poor Faz, God rest his soul. Theo patches out.
Nectar of the bowling gods, Faz.
We've been partners a long time now, haven't we Buzz?
Simple math, Buzz.  Two plus two does not equal three.
I'm sure you have Buzz.
They suspended me for 100 years.
I need a sponsor to get my sanction card back. Where I come from, you're the king.
It's mine.
What's it look like to you?
Don't say that about my mom!
I am underground.
I told you to get lost. You forced yourself into this mess, so the mess accommodated you. Buzz straightens out and carefully remolds the bent out of shape halo.
Bowling died for me years ago. Besides, I'm a living dead legend. I'm a hero.
See ya 'round Maynard.
Clam it!
He's not the guy, Millie. Just whip the whips.
Do you have to get your hooks into every guy I'm interested in?
SHEILA!
Someone wants to play with me?
If Junior thinks you're doing the bouncy- bouncy with his sister, he's gonna tap dance on your spleen. 
No!
You know who I am?
What ever happened to just bowling?
He killed your stoolie embezzler father, and he's gonna kill you next! Sid and Breeze push him towards the van as the crowd's MURMUR increases. Kastle turns and yells over his shoulder.
He stuck it in the ball return machine when he was a kid. Crushed all the nerve endings. Junior starts stroking the ketchup bottle with his dead hand.
Bowling "Center"!
She hit it, Mr. Kastle!
Yippy!
It's a vicious cycle.
The ladies in Akron call them thigh- ticklers.
I'd rather you didn't.
Not while I'm in training.
Nobody in this town really understands Junior. When I went to family sessions for him I realized he was the sanest one in the family. Actually, he's the only one in this whole fucking town who knows exactly who he is and what he wants.
So, what about you?
We'll get into that later.
No, I'm fascinated.
Well, that was plan A.
Plan B is your dad.
He asked me to keep an eye on you for a couple of days.
What's plan C?
It's been awhile. She didn't want me looking for my dad.
I could let them go for ten.
If you want a professional man, you have to be willing to pay for him.
Why should I help that old fuck.
You got any broken bones?
Are you fucking with me Sheila? Is something gonna happen to Buzz? Sheila seems to be trying to tell Theo, but is unable.
Why not?
Tell me, Sheila. What are you afraid of? Sheila shakes her head.
Did you - kill him?
I killed him once, I'll just have to kill him again.
I'm looking for somebody.
We provide some extracurricular activities for the senior citizens in the community.
Tell your little pal to let go.
Dwarf bowling's illegal.
Ow! Ooh! No, please! Doc said I'd be back on the planks in a week! Show him Breeze! Breeze pulls a copy of "New York Bowler" from his pocket. The headline reads "RUB OUT!:BOWLING LEGEND KACKED BY DWARFSCAM KINGPIN" with a photo of Buzz Fazeli.
Calm down, Dr. Levine.
Please, Dr. Levine.
I can't see...
Of what we're able to measure, roughly twenty-six hundred feet.
Basic English?  There's no way this spacecraft was constructed on our planet.
Forty yards.
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
Do it, Norman, it's the only choice we have.  This thing is gonna crush us.
Now!
Don't thank me, Dr. Johnson.  You weren't my choice.  The Pentagon made me take you.
Survivors?  No, I wouldn't think so.
Something like that.  That doesn't surprise you?
-- Wait a second --
ULF report?  Nobody's mentioned that in years.  You mean someone actually read it?
But sir, I don't understand.  This report -- these recommendations... they're for an encounter with extra- terrestrial life.
You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened.
Yes, I do.  Whatever's out there, I think is his response to us refusing to talk to him earlier.
You see the lever on the green box? Upper right hand corner?
Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else.
Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all.
Harry?  Can you copy?
What the hell is going on here?
In a minute, sir.
What?
Ted seems to have some ideas.
The what?
We're all very proud of you, Harry, but what the hell is it?
What's the message?
He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge.
Radiation shield, you think?
What do you make of this?
What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back?
To what?
What's inside the sphere.
The sensors are picking up something outside.
What was Edmunds doing outside?
We can't go down there.  We're not prepared.  That deep?  That takes years of training, Beth.  We're just scientists.  Lab scietists.  We wear ties and lab coats to work -- not oxygen tanks.
The library.
What about you?  What happened to you?
Normally, I'd say no.  Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity.  Makes sense.  But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
What?
Yeah, why?
Where did you get this?
What?
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people.  And there's only three of us left now.
You don't trust me?
I can't see anything.  How does it look?  Still clear?
What are you doing in the ship?  Beth?
Did you look?  It was on the top shelf.
You think?
What?
But how?
How can the sphere do that?
Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control.
Something for burns.
Bingo.
Antibiotic.
Causes sleep.
Your watch.
You think I'd really drink that?
You put explosives around the habitat, I can't imagine what you'd put in a drink.
Snakes?  What do you mean, exactly?
You tell me.
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
No, he isn't.
Am I lying?  Are you sure?  Are you absolutely sure I'm lying?  Then explain to me about the jellyfish.  Earlier.  Why did we see jellyfish?  Harry doesn't fear jellyfish.  You do.  They're your fear, aren't they?
Don't fuck with me, Beth.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
Stop what?  Don't blame me.  It's not me.
Leave me alone, Norman.
Beth -- gimme the gun.
Hear what?
Down below, Harry said we would all have to die.  Since there was no evidence on that spacecraft that anybody knew time travel through a black hole was possible -- and we all knew -- then we would all have to die before we could tell anyone. Death was the only logical explanation.  But sitting here, we still know.  So how is that possible?  Unless we make ourselves forget.
Who says it's a he?
All that banging and pounding.  I don't know.  We should think about making a good first impression.
We never even had a conversation, Norman.
Yeah, I don't know how you could make that confusion.
In time for what?
Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now.
What?
Look, would you --
Whatever I can do to help.
Gimme another explanation.
Am I?
Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish.
I can't breathe...  Am I... clear?
I thought she was with you.
You know what it is, Harry.
Help me lift her.
Are you trying, damn it?  Just --
Hurry, Norman.  Four minutes.
Wait!
We all kill ourselves?  Bad joke.  Sorry, Beth.
You mean forget?
It's not a discharge.  Right, Edmunds?  You said before, right?  So it's gotta be a message.
It's like showing Leonardo da Vinci a laptop computer.  He'd run screaming "witchcraft".  And you couldn't explain it to him, either. Modems, microchips, particle physics.
Does this mean what I think it means?
What report?
Told me what?
You mean a picture?
Of course he did.  He's been isloated for 400 years.  He wants someone to talk to.  Look, you put a human being in isolation for four days, they can become neurotic, sometimes psychotic.  We're talking about 400 years here.  An alien that shows emotional responses.  I think we need to address him, before he reacts further.
He didn't say much at all.  Honey --
I'm beginning not to like you.
I know that.
You could put it that way.
But you must!  I can't do it alone. I'm not at all like my father.  I'd never make it.
But you're still a powerful Jedi. You don't need my help.
Don't you have a Kiber crystal?
Yes... the Force... something horrible has happened.  I couldn't see what it was, or where it was, but it was terrible... terrible beyond description... the cry of millions dying at once.
Stop thinking, and start feeling. Let yourself go.
I don't get it, but I guess I did block it.
You look great!  The uniform and everything!
But there was a lot of firing earlier...
I'll make a report later.
What's that little 'droid' carrying that's so blasted important?
We captured the plans in a raid on the Imperial shipyards, but we fell under attack before I could get the data to safety, so I hid it in this Artoo unit and sent him off.
I'd like to get paid before that eventually.  I don't plan to stick around for the fireworks.
That's pretty steep.  We'd like to talk it over first.
Maybe the fact that no one would go there voluntarily could help us. They probably don't think anyone would dare try.
Let's try this way!  Holy Maker.
No, he smells something... but we haven't time to worry about it now.
They must be shielded somehow.  I'm sure the base is there.
Thanks, old buddy.  I'll be with you in a second.
Who is this?  What's your operating...
You used my savings!  You stole my savings.  If my father were here...
Thank you, sir.  I'm See Threepio, Human Cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo Detoo.
Send feed-back into the control sensors in that Detention block.
It isn't about rich... It's about who's best...!
Bye ! Write me ! I'm gonna kill you guys !
I joined up for her. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for her. I'm a fool.
YAAAAAAAA !
Death to all bugs !
Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.
In addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts.
Your father will never let you.
If you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.
Love... how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and pay attention.
The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.
Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don't exceed port speed.
No, I replotted the course. It's more efficient this way.
You and me, huh ?
Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I are a flight team now.
Funny...
No, funny there's almost no wounded at all.
Excuse me...!
You're upset, that's alright.
Who ?
Excuse me...!
Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
Good luck at the academy.
Who cares ?
Shhh...
My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he's afraid he's never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it took forever. Anyway, I guess I'm ready to go.
I like it. It's kinda...you.
Yes, ma'am. Star drive in three... two... one...
Trajectory indicates it came out of the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.
Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen...
Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.
You are. I joined up to get out on my own. And you had to tag along.
Teenagers !
Johnny, why won't you change your mind ? Does citizenship mean so much to you ?
We'll all have dinner. I'll fix your favorite.
A lot of my friends are doing Federal Service...
It's aterm of service, not a career. I just want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.
Oh, is that how it is ?
I won't quit !
It's not really working out for me here, dad. I was thinking... I was hoping it would be alright if I came home.
Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck patrol, over ...?
Keep trying, Sergeant.
Sir, thank you, sir !
Sir, yes it is, sir.
Here in Buenos Aires.
Aw, don't get mushy.
Johnny, please. Calm yourself.
Hi, mom.
Saddle up, boys, that's our trash !
Not a problem.
Been better, buddy.
Uh, I don't know.
Well, it's not really my job to please. Hope you learned something.
Uni High Tigers, sir. Don't you remember ? I was captain of the team.
Looks like a bug was in his brain, sir.
We're not leaving you here, sir !
That is how V'ger will survive.
By the Creator.
V'ger is announcing that it has arrived, sir -- that it's ready to deliver the information it was programmed to collect...
It will... take me from <U>you</U>...
They reach final position in... Twenty-seven minutes -- mark.
Mr. Scott... on my next signal.
No, Admiral. I don't think you are; not one damned bit. I remember when you recommended me for this command. You told me how envious you were, and if only you could find a way to get a starship command again. Well, sir, it looks like you found a way.
Permission to speak freely, sir?
How do you define <U>unwarranted</U>, <U>mister</U>?!
It's taken control of the computer...!
I'm afraid our hand is pretty weak, Captain.  But it's the only game in town.
This served the purpose.
It seems we <U>all</U> imagine God in our own image.
I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species.  You can assure him that's true, can't you?
Wormhole distortion has over- loaded main power systems...!
No more than I expected  Not as difficult as this. I'm sorry...
Impact in fifteen seconds...
Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you...
Communicated with us <U>how</U>?
Any reply from them?
... they may have followed it <U>too</U> precisely.
Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them. But why?
Captain, I do not believe there <U>is</U> a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such.
A life form of its own; a conscious, living entity.
The point... 
... and then to reassemble itself <U>combined</U> with the Creator. The most certain way of obtaining all the Creator's answers.
That seems to be what it has planned -- to have the Creator physically present here.
Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before...
I'm goin off-shift.  Come on...I'll walk you home.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
I need a typewritter.
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
You quit.
It's about life.
That's true.  You grow up here?
No, no, I see...
Of course.
Goodbye.
Surest thing you know.
...I always thought so...
You're still here.
What are you <u>doing</u> tonight?
Yes.
Well, then, it don't look good for the Huskies...
You got a paperclip?
Paperclip?
You going to ask me in?
Read the card.
Oh.  That's alright.  Then I'll come back at a better time.  What would be a better time?
Sure did.
I can't get it to come out right.
It used to be the Old Mill.
...take <u>any</u> two people...
Going home.
What?
No.  You, I told them, you can't betray with the picture what you're saying with the words.  And, I don't know, the movies, I don't know.  They should be socially uplifting, why does she have to show her br...what is this...?
People might be better off.  They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
You got to tell em that you saw the accident.  Don't you?
But that's what happened.
Tuesdays and Thursdays.  But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Yes, that's right.
That's so beautiful...
Where have you been...
Well, then, what's he doing here?
You doin' here, Doug, thought you started out the day with that pernicious <u>caffeine</u>...
Uh -- why did we have to leave New Hampshire?
It's what you give to your secretary instead of a raise.
They know what her tits look like.
Mitch, th'Marty Rossen, I'm here in...
I'm somewhere in the, I'm on location, eh:  This...well I'm going to solve it here, or this <u>Bimbo</u> you sent me's going to be doing a fuckin' <u>donkey</u> act in Akron, I'm talking about Restraint of Trade, Breach of...IT'S VERY SIMPLE...!
And I need a drink.
Town in New Hampshire was small town America too.  Forty thousand dollars a day, to shoot on the street.  And <u>then</u> they kicked us out...
What, what, what, what do they got that can pass for the Old Mill...
...you got to get me that street for nothing...
Fifteen hands.
That Could Be.
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Sure, what have you got?
...not if you've got something to hold on to.
What...
You mind...?
Well, Officer, don't worry ab...
The Mayor's outside.
Mr. Bailey.
Then what is the...?
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Oh.
Yeah.  Joe?  Would you, uh, tell Claire the, uh, the "thoughts" you've been...
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Listen to me:  Elanora <u>Duse</u> was playing Hamlet in London in 1905, and Royalty could not get a ticket.  She said, "I'm not doing the seven shows a week I signed for."  She said, "I cannot bare my soul seven times a week.  I am an artist. I'll do four shows a week."  The greatest actress of her time.  You know what her Producer said?
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
...he's right here, Mr. Mayor...
Well, Joe said it, and he's right.
Marty...
I'll put the, in your r...
Bob Barrenger...Bob...Bob Barrenger's in this movie?
Yes.
Well.
Nope.  I'm just supposed to hold people's hands, while they die.  What'd you say your problem was...
This young woman.
...a history of <u>nothing</u>, he was acquitted...
He told you that...
I want to talk to him.  Would you ex...
Gut Yuntif.
You mean <u>with White</u>...?
You mean you need a witness in addition to White...?
Sure.
You're very sorry, you passive aggressive, son-of-a-bitch...can we replace him?
My wife is going to have a baby, and...
Did you, where are we going tonight...?
You what...?  Is that on the callsheet, is that on the callsheet, or is that <u>personal business</u>?  Ah, Christ. <u>Marty</u>...Are we <u>paying</u> you?
I can't write it.  I lost my typewriter.
That's a real <u>fault</u>, I...
I know you do.
Hey, it's with the Gods.  We don't have the money, we have to write it out.  The best or not.  And that's a lesson.  You get your typewriter yet...?
Where have you been...?
He's got a date, he's got a date, is this guy fantastic...?  Already he learned how to write a movie, and he found a girl to get his toes curled, what a guy, what a...what a literary find...!
It's not <u>you</u>, it's...
The girl was in the car.
I really don't think you should be talking this way to a lady.
I can write it.  I can't type it.
The breasts symbolize motherhood...
No.
A spate of suspicious fires which were in fact the inspiration for the formation of the Waterford Huskies...
I left that for you.
What'd you do, <u>build</u> this...?
That's what I said.
She wants eight hundred thousand dollars to show her tits.
He's got a gift for fiction.
That we could use you in and I think that's quite a fine trade-off all around and an ill wind that blows somebody good.
I don't want to invite someone else, because this is the <u>most</u> <u>exclusive</u>...
Aren't these <u>illegal</u>?
So we just got lucky.
Only second chance we git, z'ta make the same mistake twice...
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me!  I can put myself to bed.
I killed her!
Excellent point.
Why does Rachel scream?
...why do you think?
Are you <u>kidding</u>?  It is <u>so</u> much better than the one Rachel showed me!
I bet.
Where's Rache?  It's <u>Thursday</u>, we get to be with <u>Rache</u>!
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
And bring my knees up, <u>real</u> hard, yeh?
I'm not.
Until he's old enough to read.
I'll miss you so much.
This is my daddy's house --
<u>Just</u> where I wanna be all Saturd...
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant!  It starts at seven!
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN?  GODDAMMIT!
See, I...
Why don't you say hello?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Suits me <u>fine</u>!
No.  But they stand out, a little. Like this.
YOU'RE WORSE THAN <u>SHE</u> IS!  WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, <u>TOO</u>?
No.
No!
No!  You're cheating -- you have to start from the beginning and you have to read the whole thing I can't sleep otherwise.
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
Yes.
You have the WORST flu since...
Is your bad?
I helped.
Duncan.  I've got an <u>even</u> <u>better</u> idea...
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to <u>keep</u>, <u>not</u> a job that's hard to <u>lose</u>, can't be both.
Don't do this.
Partly.  But partly, you're mad.
<u>Slugs</u>.  Have faster learning curves. <u>Trees</u>, even.
And I'm supposed to care.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own.
Stop.  You're making me insecure.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays.  I got it right here...
What is this?  The Betty Ford Center?
Nothing.  Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with...
But it's not on the schedule!
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day.
I'm already on thin ice.  Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there.
Wowie.  How wonderful!
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets.  And the note.  From your new boss.
How the hell would you know?
You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>!
...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once.
It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back.
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
You mean, after I'm dead?
Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
I have their past.
Yeh, it's cheaper.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
But you're not good at this.  Not yet. I'm sorry.
It's complicated for Jackie.  It's complicated for me...You don't have kids -- you don't understand --
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
Rache, it may take time.
What do you call it?  You told her you had doubts.
Tucker hasn't penned Ben's present yet -- it won't be too much longer.
Hey. What's up?
What?
Conan O'Brien? Whoa! What are you doing here?
Be your sidekick, you know, and maybe eventually become a TV talk- show host.
It was God's will.
No, Mikey.
I'm always working.
This is work.
No.
My Jesus…
My baby.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
What?
Of course, honey. Come in bed with us. Come on.
I dunno.
How was the class?
You mean, again?
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
You know he hated my story also.
I have a cousin. Very big giver to the alumni fund.
...But Mr Livingston, aren't you a bit fearful that Scooby will be confronted with hollow values and systemic conformism?
Dad, I'm trying to figure things out right now, OK? It's like, really hard, and I'm just listening to some old Elton John and...
Don't screw around with me. You know what I'm talking about.  You're taking those SATs. You're taking those SATs or your CD collection is history. You're taking those SATs and you're going to college. You're taking those SATs if I have to strap your ass to a chair, but buddy your taking them.
Maybe he's building a bomb...just like-!
Sure, Dad.
What are you doing here?
I'm not 'going out' with Catherine.
Take off your top.
Say, Ni...
Say, 'Nigger, fuck me hard!'
Oh, fine. How are you?
Great!
I worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, I mean, that was like - I mean, I have some dignity.
Oh. Tired of 'life in the fast lane'?
Yeah, sure.
You should be.
Yeah. I know.
Y-yes--
Well, I-I hope that--that--
Why? Are we going dancing?
Just the soda, please. Cooper heads down the hall.  Filmore watches him leave, sighs, then turns and smiles at the General manager:
What happened!
You should listen your old man more often.  He's got principles.
After Leizburg, he stuck his neck out to defend me.  He's loyal to the end. Even if it's not--politically correct at the time.
What happened?
Well Cooper...
I don't see why they wouldn't be.
Hey now!  No cussing on TV!  Well in closing I'd like to say that there are two reasons to have that money outside in an hour.  One is my perky co-anchor here, and the second is the lives of tens of thousands of people--people just like you and me!
I don't want any...
I said I don't want any, goddammit!
We've prohibited the networks from broadcasting the transmissions.
Chemco's been developing nerve gas?
The ball is in Richter's court.  But we're sure as hell not going to sit on our hands while he assassinates people--we're gonna stop the son-of- a-bitch!
I assure you gentlemen if we had something of that magnitude it wouldn't be shelved in a lab somewhere...
Richter-we got a problem!
Excellent...excellent!
What are you so worked up about jack? Fuck 'em--we don't need 'em.
You're fucking crazy Richter--you know that?
Dissent?
How much of this shit do they have, White!!
Certainly - how about some breakfast?
Now, Mister Ambassador.  In a very few moments we should have Premier Belch on the phone.  I intend to tell him exactly what has happened.  I merely want you to authenticate certain facts for him.
At his office in the Capitol.
Did you get that, Kulnick?
First of all, economic reasons.  It was cheap.  The entire project cost just a fraction of what we spent in a single year on our various space and missile programs. It also seemed ideal in most other respects. It was terrifying, convincing, automatic, and extremely simple to understand.
Allow me to assure you that my government will not be satisfied with a polite note of regret for this shocking example of aggression against our peace-loving people.
It is very convenient to place all the blame on a dead man.
I caught you red-handed, Mister Ambassador.
See!  See, I told you.
Come in...come in... Peace On Earth... Peace On Earth...yes...
Look, I didn't shoot him!
Look, Colonel.  Maybe it's too late. Maybe they've sent Air Command in already.  But we've got to try to con- tact somebody.
Wait a minute.  The President!!  That's it! The President!!!
What is your name, young lady?
What did you say, sir?
Yes, sir.  He issued attack orders to --
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take the film out.
Well...I suppose penetrate the base by force.
This is General Ripper speaking.
No, sir.
That's right, sir.
I understand, sir.  Nothing comes or goes without your personal say-so.
Yes, sir.  I just thought of something, sir.  How do I know I'm talking to you now?
No, sir.  Plan-R to be radioed to the Wing.
I know that, sir.
Ask away, Major.
You're being dense, Major.  I certainly don't
You're absolutely right.  You forgot to mention their nuclear subs.  But it wouldn't matter. Sure we wouldn't get off without getting our hair mussed, but we'd prevail.  I don't think we'd lose more than fifty million people, tops.
Major Mandrake, I guess you don't follow what's going on too closely, do you?
Where?  Everywhere, Major.  Everywhere.
You're very naive, Major.  Don't they say they want disarmament?
But war doesn't make sense precisely because the weapons can kill an entire country -- right?
I was just going to say, as long as the weapons exist, sooner or later something's going to happen -- and that'll be it for both countries.
Well, sir, I remember an example that pointed out that if a system was safe on 99.99% of the days of the year, given average luck it would fail in thirty years.
Gee, sir, that last remark doesn't exactly make all the sense in the world.
Well, I'm not, sir.  Honestly, sir.
Don't you think he knows something about this, General Ripper?
But, General, we're on our toes.  We haven't agreed to anything for years.  Inffact, a a lot of people say we never will.
Well, what about the Positive Control, the safety catch?  Don't the planes automatically come back unless they get a second order?
And I suppose there's some reason why you haven't recalled them?
What the hell is Plan-R?
Why can't you cancel it?
That's the idea, General Schmuck.  Zlat!
Well, just common sense, sir.  Thirty from thirty-four equals four, or my name's not "Buck" Schmuck!
Yes, sir.  We're still sending it.  But it's a funny thing we don't seem to be able to make any contact with the aircraft at all.
If I can speak freely, sir -- look, these guys talk big, but frankly, we think they're short of know-how.  You can't just take a bunch of ignorant peasants and expect them to understand a machine like one of our boys, and I don't mean that as an insult, Mister Ambassador.  Hell, we all know what kind of guts your people have.  Why just look how many millions of 'em those Nazis  killed and, hell, they still wouldn't quit.
Thanks, Binky.  Can you see Bromdingna Island yet?
Can't help it.  What's the wind like?
They must have clobbered some of our cities already!
Fifteen!  Twelve o' clock.
Zombies set to knock out local air defense four hundred miles from primary.
Fighters closing fast - range fifty miles.
Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
Yeah, it sure looks like the real thing, all right.
Primary arming switch.
Very interesting.
Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already.  We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
Seond safety.
All right, Lothat, that does it.  Master safety on now until bomb run.
Hell, he looks dead.
What do you mean?
Well, we sure as hell aren't going home just because the enemy tells us to.
You tell me.
It's me - Lothar.  Are you okay?
But I TOLD YOU, I don't think we can get the bomb bay doors open.
Let me check.
Now what the hell did you want to go and do a thing like that for, Lothar?
I'd be mighty proud if you did, Lothar.
Listen, Lothar.  You know that crack I made about your...butt?
Wait. Racism? You don't know anybody who's black!
I don't anymore.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess.
Was it okay?
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Oh, right. Oh, oh my God! Pony, it's so huge!
Same, more of the same. Yep, just keep doing the same thing all the time, around and around the clock. With an occasional burger or slice of thrown in for our vitamins and energy. Then, instead of watching Gilligan, we'd watch Captain Kirk.
Okay.
... idiot! Open the damn door! Go, go, go, come on!
No, no.
No, no, I wasn't trying.
No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
No, I mean, no one.
Uh, last night...
Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
You know?
No.
Jeff! Let's go!
Yeah, right, publicist.
Wait, what happened to the tree?
Buff, please, would you jus fuck off, okay? Fuck off!
Sure I am. It's fun.
In what way?
This is private property, my friend.
Are you talking to me?
Naw, naw, we don't have time for all that.
No man.  He's probably the most famous guy that'd ever come in this place. You're lucky he's here.
Yes!
Alright, get in the car before I have to embarrass you in front of your friend.
Oh, yeah?
Jeff, Erica. God, it's so amazing to be back home.
He wrote this thing about his dick once and he read it in front of the whole class.
Funny shit, man.
He's drunk.
Hey, he's a human being you can give him that much.
Sooze wants to see him.
Okay, great. Well, now he's crying. Are you guys happy?
What? Oh, come on. You're not gonna suck my cock?
I'm not suffering, you know. I don't give a shit.
No.
Yeah, fuck 'em.
Fuck 'em! Fuck 'em all, man!
No, no. I'm not, I'm not talking about this. I did a bad thing, Jeff.
You want to know what your problem is, Jeff? You want to believe so bad, you'll buy anything. It's true. Look at you. You're gullible and you're gutless.
You don't know?
Is that Bee-Bee?
Okay. Nazeer, okay?
Nazeer Chaudry!
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
Tim!
... like fucking robots. Look at those kids there.
No, no, see, that's not what I'm saying. I could go to New York if I wanted to, but what's the point? So I can learn how to order a cappuccino? So I can get mugged by some crackhead? So I can see, see homeless people up close and personal?
Nothing.
Okay, look. My job is not who I am. I don't need that. Why? What's your goal? Status? Money? Getting your picture on the cover of some glossy magazine?
I, yeah.
Wait. What, what are you saying?
'Bye, Jeff.
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Oh, man, we were pretty on tonight.
Yeah, really.
Yeah.
Look, man, it... Shit. Why don't we get something to eat? I mean food?
No. You know what? You guys go ahead and bring back something here. Yeah.
Well, what about this?
Why? What are you gonna do? Huh? You're gonna shoot me for standing on your fucking trash can?
Oh, there you are, honey. We were waiting for you. What happened?
This has nothing to do with me, this, uh, drinking, yeah.
It's stupid.
Wow. Hey, you look good. Like you, you know, head's in a good place, you know? You, are still doing your painting?
Oh, yeah, just sitting there eatin' a salad, you know. That kind of thing happens all the time in L.A. It's, you know... I met Johnny Depp.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's because I am.
Or the future, oh, no, no, I mean... I mean, we'll be working on that album cover, right?
Where do you get your ideas?
"I sound like an idiot watching the parade I know there's no tomorrow only the charade I am dead Deep inside my head All the lies There's no then Only now I will love show me how"
What are you? Her pimp? She said she might go get a drink first.
It's none of my business?
Yeah.
Uh, eleven twenty-five.
It's not the air force anymore, Scuff
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Come on, Jeff.
Uh, excuse me, I'd like to know where he gets his ideas.
Oh that's nice for you.
There was this other place where they served live monkey brains. Sweat to God. You walk in, they bring the little monkey out, shave his head, crack it open, and you eat it's brains while it's still alive. I didn't go in, though, 'cause I didn't have any money and my mom has a saying: "Don't write any checks you can't cash".
You piece-a-shit bug zapper!
You have three heart attacks and a half dozen strokes and tell me how much you wanna run up and down the stairs.  Shit - I forgot to pick up the cigarettes.
Wayne Gretzky.
My fault - What do we do that enables us to be as great as we are?
No...I've been pregnant.
No I don't... I keep asking because I feel fat.
And they get caught!
So then this isn't crazy.  It's a sure bet.
Of course - of course!  Hands in...
That's right.  Practice makes perfect. I'm practicing to have a baby right now. If we do a practice job, we'll not only get the experience, but also the extra money we need for guns!
Diane, I've loved you ever since I first saw you -- right before you kicked me in the head.
Trix...
Ah!  I almost forgot gas for the baby machine.  I'll grab your Snickers and get a place in line.
We're here for you, Diane.
Lucy, do you know for sure you're going to get that scholarship?
He Ikea'd us.
I guess there's an exception to every rule.
Yeah.  "Itchy" sent us.
Uh...maybe?
Bank branch!
Thank G-d.  I was starting to think I'd killed the wrong man.
My what?
Virgin Mary musta snuck that one in.
Stop it!  This is crazy!
I hear she was a terror to work with.
You'll pardon me, Norma? Why don't you just sit and watch?  O.K.  Here we go.
Action! The scene starts.
Don't worry.  She's just a fan for my literary output.
I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career.
Nothing for Ladd?
Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
I just think pictures should say a little something.
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Sure.  Bases Loaded.
Dark Windows.  How did you like it?
I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas.
Life can be beautiful!
Is that so? What's the wonderful news?
Well, for heaven's sake!
Why should you do that?
See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
It will?
Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings...
Something came up.  I don't want to talk about it.
It's nothing.  I got a telegram from Artie.
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe.  Is it something awful?
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
That's no excuse.  You read the script, didn't you?
Don't play innocent.  Somebody named Gordon Cole.
Lady.  you've got the wrong man.
Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc.
Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures.
Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it.
Sure you did.  That's what makes it great.  What it needs is a little more dialogue.
I don't know.
December twenty-first.
Are you married, Mr.  -- ?
You can stay here.
Thanks for the invitation, but I have my own apartment.
I'll take care of that.
I'm used to paying my own bills.
Just a scene I cut out.
The one where you go to the slave market.  You can cut right to the scene where John the Baptist -
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
What's wrong with It?
I don't like those studs they've sent.  I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me.
Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head?
Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about?
What kind of a silly thing was that to do?
Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being.
They're awful.  They make me cough.
Maybe deMille is shooting.
He'a a shrewd old fox.  He can smell box office.  Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e.  This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
Good night.
I went for a walk.
I haven't done anything, Norma.
Max is a good idea.  He can help with my luggage.  Thanks for letting me wear the handsome wardrobe.  And thanks for the use of all the trinkets.
You think I made that up about the gun...
Wake up, Norma.  You'd be killing yourself to an empty house.  The audience left twenty years ago. Now face it.
Go on in.
Dressed for what?
Thanks.  Say, she's quite a character, that Norma Desmond.
It was the room of the husband. Or of the husbands, I should say. Madame has been married three times.
I wouldn't look too closely at the postmarks.
That didn't leave much for Wallace Reid.
I just found out why all those tele- phone calls.  It is not Miss Desmond they want.  It is the car they want to rent.
It's just that I'm very worried about Madame.
What car?
It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him.
Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline.
Frankly, no.
Maybe what you need is another agent.
Did you intend to kill him? Just answer me that.
Okay.  And let's have the car right outside.
Yes, Madame.
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
But the phantom Zone is for criminals.
What is it?
The danger. The one Nigel spoke of. It must be near .
And then, like great cats---we pounce! And destroy!
He will be. In about five minutes.
No, a super girl.
I've been saving it. For the right moment.
Yes, of course, it was foolish of me.
And the first thing we do is get rid of Supergirl!
Who didn't?
It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me.
Of course not, but...there are things we don't understand.
Terrific.
Ethan---when I said 'a while' I meant a couple of hours.
I sort of like what you said.
It seemed that way to me.
I know what it is. She has this lead container shaped like a gargoyle. Inside there's a silvery ring...
Can you get us out? It's all a misunderstanding. We thought they were selling hamburgers in that place.
What an adorable hat.
But she is real, it wasn't just a concussion.
Well...I guess I can't.
I've got things to do.
How do you know?
Did anybody notice you?
Lucy! Be serious. We could be executed for  treason!
I wish they'd tell us what they're going to do with us.
Why haven't you been able to contact him? He should have returned from the neutron galaxy ages ago. He may be dead. ZOR-EL But what can you, a mere girl-
It was my fault. You aren't old enough to use the wand. I shouldn't have given it to you.
No sweat. When's the rest of your stuff arriving?
Since what?? Did you have a fire at your house or something?
But what for?
It doesn't seem right.
He's nice.
I have to get back. I'm having dinner with the Danvers.
It may well be. I know how you won that election Selena. You can't fool me.
Throw him out.
We are in great danger. A being has come to Earth with powers far beyond those of anyone member of the Craft.
Why get rid of her at al1? You've used the Coffer of Shadow too much.  It is beginning to rule your heart.
Not yet.
It's the most beautiful place in the universe.
It's everywhere. But water is always the door.
I knew it!
Going to try. Didn't say I could.
Don't stop. Keep moving.
It's Selena. I'm getting so I can recognise her work.
Zaltar!
Buddy, are we in trouble.
Good lord, fella! I'm talking about your boss.
There's no vodka in it.
What? What did you tell me?
Brad.
Brad Wilson.
You always did.  Can I give you a hand with that?
And here I am, just standing here. That's terrible. Thank you.
It sure is.
You thought that?
But all he had was chocolate milk.
Uh-huh.
Please, Kent, not now. I'm trying to put out a newspaper here.
Kent!
We get together sometimes.
Say!
I'd better be. Suddenly I've got competition to keep up with.  Your high school reunion article. I though it was terrific. And fascinating.  Especially about the girl back home.  I'll tell you what, Clark, I'll take you to lunch and you can tell me all about it.
Gus Gorman.
Yeah.
Thirty-five.
What about this week's check?
What'm I gonna do with half a cent? Buy me a thoroughbred cockroach?  Everybody loses them fractions?
Uh...yeah. I didn't think of it that way exactly, but...
Black or regular?
Which country?
Like everything else in the 20th century, Gus. You push buttons.
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.
First question got to be "Where."
Just the man I wanted to see!
What are you talking about, fella?
They ain't got captains?
Pumps stop pumping oil. Pipe lines stop pipin' oil. Tankers stop deliverin' oil. Man, this is high stakes.
I knew it, I knew it, go be nice to people and they think they can ask for the moon!
I should think a taste of freedom is enough, don't you? Or would you prefer jail?
Don't be getting' racist with me, man.
For what?
What will it get me?
Man, all it got to do is find their weak spot.  You bet on the machine in any fight you name, you gonna win your bet.
Sister! I'm his sister!
Oh Bubba, think of the possibilities.
What about me?
Okay, Kent, call your people and tell them the Prodigal Son is coming home. FAVORING CLARK -- Happy now, he turns to leave the office. SHOT LOSES PERRY but we continue to hear his voice, o.s.
Bubba, does this woman have the right to burst in without knocking...!
Why don't you hold your breath, instead? Maybe you'll turn blue. On you that'd be an improvement.
But how? Where's it getting the power from ???!
Why can't the idiot in Circulation who dreamed up this imbecile contest in the first place ---
53!
How'm I supposed to turn this thing?
Why do I have to do this?
My friend, you are yesterday. Whoever pulled this caper is tomorrow.
Oh, right. Well then, just shake hands.
Storms! Floods!
Today coffee----
Don't cry, Bubba.
We can get to work on that oil!
Yeah. I'll check.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Lois, help! I can't --  I can't swim -- !
Lois, I . . .
We'd better talk.
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
Oh, hi.
You're not selfish at all.
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
That's why they call 'em terrorists.  Go down to the morgue and dig up anything you can find on past incidents of --
The minute the story broke I bundled her on the first Concord out of here. If Paris goes kablooey I want the best reporter I've got right there in the middle of it.
I wouldn't know. I've never had one.
So does your average cocker spaniel. Give me another one.  Under . . . the big one there.
It' s fantastic! ----- This place is genius.
It's beautiful.
Wrong.
Yes.
No possibility for parole?
I asked the right question.
I didn't ask her anything . . .
To ski?
Oh! That black box in our cell?
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
Listen. Have I got a proposition for you, Superman. I mean I owe you one, you know? Now don't say yes or no till you hear me out . . .
Cuba.
It will. Starting with your own.
Um. . . .we have made this guarantee.
What shall we do now?
Yes?
Don't worry. I will draw his fire.  With a few of my own.
Don't worry, I've got you.
Yes, I know. I'm sure it will be a great story.
I don't think 'fan mail' fits this letter.  Read it, Clark.
It's her father's grey matter that's weakened if you ask me. How can I ask Superman such a dumb question.
Everyone's saying he's . . . dead. But I know that isn't true. I feel it in my heart. I think he just needs help.
And what am I? A Shriner? No, If you'll join forces with me, together we can make the world safe for war profits again.
Absolutely!
Jeremy, I need you to tell the people of the world what you see.
I know Daddy. I'm worried about him.
Don't be over-dramatic, young lady. What kind of disaster could we help bring about?
. . . And  very naïve!
Lenny, ,you pathetic product of the public school system. Your Uncle Lex has had only one thing on his awesome mind during his incarceration . . . Destroying Superman!
A toupee that flies?
Let's try to keep your I.Q. a family secret, Leonard. Before we launch him against Superman, we have to test him ... see how well he does with mayhem and destruction. Kind of a coming out party under the glare of media covering the Metro Club gala. And once he proves himself, then . . .
Not how I might have put it, but, correct. The remains I sent to the sun included the creatures genetic memory. He'll remember everything that he experienced. Not to worry. He'll find his way back to me.  Did you hear that?
There!
What?
Never. But we have to hide out for a  while. Lay low. Say. . . a couple of years. By then I'll have a new plan.
Wait! Not yet! Back!
Wonderful. Otis will go above and steal some Big Macs.
We're running out of smoke.
He's a good man, Ben is. Your father always said so.
North. It's north
Well!
No.
What the  --  !
No. I'm just thinking that you smoke too much, if you don't mind my saying so.
Mirrors, then. It's done with mirrors.
You're not the only one.
You too.  I just...I can't get it on for good guys. Y'know?
Look, lady, you saved my life once. I owe you a favor. But I can't understand why you follow a man like that.
Compared to what came before? A year of living in the sewers?  A part of that will always be with me.
What about dinner? I have to worry about the crime of the century, that's all. Y'know? Am I supposed to worry about what's in the refrigerator, too?  What's in it?
Tough guy, huh?
Krypton? The place where Superman comes from?
Bingo!
I know I'm going to get rapped in the mouth for saying this, but so what?
I don't like to talk about it, Lex.
You ever try to run in high heels?  You probably did.
You?! How about me?
Hit you? A clever girl like you?  'He turned slowly, slowly in the lava...' was how you described it. Now that's clever.  I have to hand it to you.
A night on the town instead of under it?
What if he doesn't show up? What if he's taking a nap?
Lex is going bye-bye.
You are one of Krypton's greatest scientists Jor-El -
'And the people on the street, the little man who runs the corner newsstand, the old lady sunning herself on the stoop the kids playing stick ball -- none of them will ever forget the night of senseless bloodletting that turned a friendly block part into a nightmare.' 
Don't brag now,  Jonathan.
A million years behind us.  Jor-El, he's only a baby.
I want to know what my child is going to face.
Enjoyed it?
Nine to five it's a Pulitzer Prize, I know.
Let's just say I'm a friend.  And watch yourself from now on with those things, Okay?  I mean if the good lord wanted people to fly he would have given them wings.
Ask, You're the girl reporter.
The reason I can fly is because my molecular structure is so constituted that I have a lighter density under Earth's gravitational force.
It's not bad.
Thirty-five.
Matter? With me? Nothing's the matter.
I guess I...uh...regressed.
Maybe it's being polished or something. Maybe they're cleaning it.
Sure. It's the joining together of two land masses pushed together eight million years ago. The fault line itself is unstable and always shifting, which is the reason you get earthquakes in the California area from time to time.
Ally.  That was my nickname.
How is Mrs. Stephens?
Sunnyridge.  That was a long time
It turns to steaming piss.
Not unless you can raise the dead.
You can help each other.  Several people have agreed to let me represent them in a negligence suit. Your case as an individual will be stronger if I'm allowed to represent you together as a group.
Hi, Mr. Ansel.  Hi, Jessica, Mason...
Was it good?
Okay.
Yeah.
Well I don't want a damned thing to do with it.
So?  I mean, lot's of folks have got lawyers.
C'mon, you know that won't...
I'll help pay for Nicole, if that's what you're really talking about. I'll even give you the money I got for my kids.  That's what we used to do, remember? Help each other.  This was a community.
No.  It should be dry by now.
Risa, I serviced that bus.  At the garage.  There's nothing wrong with it.
Why?
Well I don't.
Do they have any reputation for drugs?
Did he have any particular problems that you knew of?  Financial pressures...run-ins with the law...
And what's that?
You mentioned that he had a learning disability.
Did his parents attend to that?
Mrs.  Driscoll, if Billy Ansel does not volunteer to say so in court, I will subpoena him and oblige him to testify to that effect.
What other people?
A cup of tea would be nice.  Would it be alright if I sit down for a few minutes, Mrs. Otto?  I want to talk to you.
No.  A little sugar though.
Summer's over.  It's fall.
I won't lie.
You seem very sure about that.
Was the bus on time?
Did there come a time when the bus turned off Staples Mill Road onto
She...she was a friend of mine.
People who will help our cause.
Crafts?
Thanks.
Is there shrimp on it?
Who did they get for that?
Mrs.  Otto,  there is no such thing as an accident.  The word doesn't mean anything to me.  As far as I'm concerned, somebody somewhere made a decision to cut a corner.  Some corrupt agency or corporation accounted the cost variance between a ten-cent bolt and a million dollar out-of-court settlement.  They decided to sacrifice a few lives for the difference.  That's what's done, Mrs. Otto.  I've seen it happen so many times before.
And according to your recollection, there was nothing unusual about the drive that morning?
Yes.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything.  And that's all.  I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all.  Then I was in the hospital.
Really?
It's okay.
As opposed to this T.V.?
How about Sunday night?  That's always the best time.
It's too late for that.  She can't drive the bus anymore.  The school board saw to that right off.
But Charlene...
You don't know that.
Alone or surrounded?
Don't apologize for me, Frank!
Not that I'm convinced, but you'll never prove it in a million years.  Steve, you'll do what you want, but it can't hurt; he offers you an olive branch - so today like olives!
Your nephew doesn't want a drink.
Yeah, and it's the truth, to the best of my knowledge.  And, frankly, I'm glad.  For Steve's sake, I'm glad, not yours.  I manage these boys and I got their best interests at heart.  Steve shouldn't get mixed up with no bimbo at his age.
Not in those exact words - you know what a temper he's got.
Coupla weeks.  For eight weeks.
I don't like this threatening attitude.  When it comes to it, what the heck is it your business what they do, this boy and girl...
And, instead, he printed his heel in your face?
Otis was outraged when I told him Van Cleve was going to fire you. Tell him not to pay any attention to anything you-know-who says about you-know-what.  Right, Otis?
Give me a chance --
He's here, isn't he?  Do you think, sir, when he dies he'll go to the dog and cat heaven?
But that wasn't your fault, dear, what happened to Leslie.  I've told you that a million times...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
A man couldn't ask for a squarer shake.  Let me have Billy Van Cleve...  Don't ever tell anyone, Susie, how I'm tied to your apron strings...  Billy!  J.J.!  What's this about that boy?  What boy?  Where are we, lug, in a drawing room comedy? You're brain is warming up, sweetheart - yeah, Dallas!...  No, don't explain your point of view, but...
No...
No.  I'm going home.
Bonna sera, commendatore.  Come sta?
You just had a good example of it. A press agent eats a columnists dirt and is expected to call it manna.
You print them, don't you?
Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
Get Steve back his job...please...
Yes.  With your "prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel.
No, that's the point - he won't accept your favor!  The manager yes, but not the boy.
She knows now.
He goes out with girls.
Yeah...  And another thing - he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...  You know J.J....!
And why should I bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?
No.  It's one of J.J.'s occasional beau gestes.  Evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed.  In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
Help me with two minutes of silence!
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
Stay down town tonight.  Maybe we'll take in a show, etc.
Frank thinks I shouldn't have come here -
Only two men in this town could be responsible for that smear - you or Hunsecker or both.
Temple, I caught your act the other night and -
You tell him, I stutter!
What ship?
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
That was two months ago.  Take your hand out of my pocket, thief!
Steve, dear, please forget all of this.  What can it matter after tomorrow?
Susie, I was there for OUR sake, too.  But what a world it would be if we were all afraid to learn to walk and talk because it might offend poppa!  By the way, I think your brother was completely responsible for the smears...
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time!  I was born only yesterday!...
I'm sorry, baby.  This thing is just kicking my ass.  I thought we had it with this one...
You are targeted for termination.  The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.
Max.
It can't form complex machines.  Guns and explosives have chemicals, moving parts.  It doesn't work that way.  But it can form solid metal shapes.
Yeah, well fuck you, she's a priority to me!
Of course.  I'm a terminator.
Why?
Right.
No problemo.
Yeah, I thought you'd like this place.
I don't care!! There's gotta be another way. Haven't you learned anything?!  Haven't you figured out why you can't kill people?
I'm sorry, John.
Actually, no, she's a complete psycho.  That's why she's up at Pescedero.  She tries to blow up a computer factory, but she got shot and arrested.
I need to know how Skynet get built.  Who's responsible?
SHOOT!!!!
Don't quit, Sarah.  Our son need you.
Remember the message... the future is not set. There is not fate but what we make for ourselves.
There's 215 bones in the human body, motherfucker. That's one.  Now don't move!
And Skynet fights back.
Jesus.  How much do you know about Dyson?
No.  There is another chip.
Major Arnold believes he has a moral duty, too.
But it still doesn't make them saints. They still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? They can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. Well, just like me. Can't they?
A human being, oh, good, I'm relieved, I thought you were going to say you were a music lover. This man, this great artist has made anti-Semitic remarks like you wouldn't believe. I got letters.
Not yet.
Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
I have a duty.
No. Ours was damaged.
I did not conduct at at the rally, I conducted on the evening before the rally.
Could I have a glass of water, please? Please, Fraulein?
I need to work. I need to make my living. I live off the generosity of friends...
Then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the Party, who used to play the Horst Wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while I have to wait and wait and wait?
I believe it was because of another letter I'd written to Goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.
During an enforced hour-long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in Berlin, Albert Speer, the Minister of Armaments, said to me, 'You look very tired Dr. Furtwängler, you should go abroad for a while.' I knew exactly what he meant.
If you are going to bully me like this, Major, you had better do your homework. You obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.
Don't talk to me like I was a second violinist. Go back into the waiting room. Miss Straube will come and get you when I am ready to see you.
Well, I tried, you got to admit I tried. I thought I might just trap you there, Wilhelm, but David here was too quick for me. Smart move, David, smart move. No, I don't have the telegram, but I know it exists. And I want you to know, Wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because I believe you sent it.
Art and politics, yeah, art and politics. Let's look at that. You and the Berlin Philharmonic toured the Third Reich, played in countries the Nazis had conquered. Are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for Adolf and all he stood for?
No!
No, I'm not going to stop it. Hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.
I don't understand what you mean.
It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.
Do you know Hans Hinkel?
Helmuth.
How could I forget?
So. You wanted to see me.
Major, we're discussing a man of genius, I don't want...
One of my people?
No. But that's why we hated him. We admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the Party and yet he had a better life than any of us. He didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. He got everything from them, everything. He was filthier than any of us Party members.
Who's he?
His private life?
Like this bandleader.
Absolutely not.
He also conducted for Hitler, didn't he?
You're late.
Not really.  Do you think you can get here on time if I put you on the floor as a waitress?
It's not brain surgery, Chuck.
A phased plasma pulse-laser in the forty watt range...
We will, kiddo.
What's it to ya?
What's it to ya?
Look, Reese, I know you want to help, but...
Tell me.  Just start at the beginning.
What?
What about it?
That's the way it was told to me.
Nitroglycerin, basically. Bit more stable.  I learned howto make it when I was a kid.
It's better that way.
Kyle...
Yes.
That can't be right.  That's the name of the one Valley Division mopped up this after- noon.
You gotta be kidding me.  The new guys'll be short-stroking it over this one.  A one-day pattern killer.
I know.
Suspect westbound on Olympic.  Grey sedan.  Has hostage, repeat...
Now, look...
Did you?  Kudos.
I said I was sorry...
What's going on?  I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
What... is... happening... ?
What are you talking about?
You mean, the guy who turned blue and <u>wet</u> himself... ?
Why not?
You first.
You pull me up.
What's C.R.S.?
Me?  You're the one who... !  Shit!
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Nicholas.  Nicholas Van Orton.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Well... the red bra.
I didn't say anything.
What do you mean?  I checked them myself.  I made the calls...
What... what do you mean?
You tell me... I want to know who's behind this.  Who did this to me... how, why... ?
They will!  You tell them if they don't come now, I will shoot you!
What are you doing?
Stop it!
Single?
Conrad, what a surprise.  Gesundheit.
"Seymour Butts."  I never get tired of that one.
Which grad-school?
Elizabeth?
No.
I said I would...
Okay, okay... okay?  I just... you know I hate surprises.
You think I know?  I paid them <u>more</u> to make it stop.
No.  Do you?  Can't be too hard, can it?  I don't think we should be here out in the open like this.
Stop this.  It's not true...
This... ?  Oh, this is just... this is the bill.
Yes.
Yes.
I'm not quite sure how this works. My brother...
What's all this for?
No, I mean, what is it FOR?  What are you selling?
Cursory examination.  Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing.  You'll be out of here in no time.
Don't take another step.
Have we met?
Is there a room key?
No, you didn't...
Have a nice day.
Thank you.  Goodnight.
Okay.  I think he's into some sort of new personal improvement cult.
Did the alarm go off?  The house... they... you didn't see... ?
It's a private matter, for you... I think you'll be more comfortable...
His behavior... ?
A gentleman left a message requesting a lunch, but I assured him...
Nothing.  Nothing at all.
That you've involved Conrad... is unforgivable.  I am now your enemy.
It was a misunderstanding.
What about the house?
What?
Who's Watts?
I did okay.
I thought it best to be isolated, to be in a location with a definite sense of history, and I wanted to make sure that it wasn't so pleasant you'd all sleep too easily.  You'll be taking a variety of tests, none of them harmful, and you've got the house, the grounds, and each other to keep you company.
Yeah.
Sure.
Go ahead.
It's a question.
Just stay there, Nell!
He must have left.  Didn't like the looks of the place or something.
It was very specific.
I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
Yes.
I wish I were.  I wish I had done it, then I could confess and you'd be at peace.  That great moral philosopher Frank Sinatra once said to someone he loved, I wish you had an enemy, so I could beat him up.
I don't know.
Nell.  You will come here now.
Nell, the first time I ever spoke with you in person was the night we met here.
How'd I know it was for you?
Every day.  Basically we'll be hanging out together like we have so far this evening.
Good morning, Theo.  Luke.
Mary came with me.
How could you do this to people?
That's a good question.  What is it about fences?  Sometimes a locked chain makes people on both sides of the fence just a little more comfortable.  Why would that be?
I've seen 'em.  Lot to dust.
It's all I could afford.
My boyfriend thinks so, my girlfriend doesn't.  If we could all live together... but... they hate each other.  It's hard to be Miss Perversity when you're the only one at the party.  D'you know what I mean?
Maybe you did it yourself.
Because I don't want to ruin things.  Because home is where the heart is.
Carolyn showed me where she hid him, hid him with all the ones he killed --
Nell, it makes sense.  It all makes sense.  You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
I don't think I want any.
I <u>want</u> to know why you <u>need</u> that scary guy in your house.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
All your life.  That happened while I swam the length of my pool.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
Why not?
This is un-fucking professional.
Why, because you're my security consultant?  This cocksucker nearly burnt my house down.
And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him.
We'll find him.
You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here.
England.  Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing.
Round about, yeah.
It was better than a telegram.
Terry Valentine.
I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ...
That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else.
Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they.
Nick's a nick, n' it?  No matter what state you're in.  State of remorse, most likely -- for gettin' caught.
What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages?
Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all.
Butcher's hook.  Look.  I don't much reckon those minders of his.
He's brought in the heavy mob.
You goin' back inside?
Well, those are the breaks.
No, but I know what he means.
Wanted to talk to you, didn't I?
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
Hardly buried.  Earning interest, love. Earning interest in an offshore account. Tidy little premium per annum, that.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Not ashamed.
She never told Eddie, though.
-- Mr. Lindgren.
We were <u>lucky</u> to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing.
He alive to see this?
Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for?
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
How do you know?
Good job your lot showed up when they did or it would've been <u>me</u> for the high jump.
Oh, yeah, right.  The deal.
And that is?
My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
Ian?
Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that.
Nine years?  Is that legal?
Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I <u>really</u> want to fuck you.
I don't know.
So what.
Lemme break.
Something's on.
Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial."
I doubt it.
Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now.
Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions?
I don't want you here, Terry.
Susan.
We went camping last summer. In Eugene, Oregon. *Outside* of Eugene, Ed.
A spacecraft. I saw the creatures. They led Big Dave onto the craft. He never told anyone what they did, outside of his report. Of course he told *me*. No one else.
Sometimes knowledge is a curse, Ed. After this happened, things changed. Big Dave... he never touched me again.
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Boy.
Oh, Mr Crane--
He didn't say that.
Well? How'd she do?
I don't understand, no mistakes, she's just a kid--I thought you taught the, uh, the--
Well, look, I don't claim to be an expert--
That right.
I'll have it in a week.
Way out of line.
Sure.
Yeah.
And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
...Why don't you just pay him, Dave?
...Huh?
Just coffee.
Honey?
Nah, go ahead. I'm not big on parties.
How's that?
I didn't say a word.
Honey...
What happened to you?
Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
I... just knew. A husband knows.
I don't know. I don't think so.
I took Doris's keys.
So, who should I--
Uh-huh. Is he the best then, for, uh...
Yeah.
Check out the rack on that broad in the angora.
Sorry, I just didn't remember.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah--go home.
Come on, Eddie, you're gonna scare the kid.
Yeah.
Frank, uh, you know I'll try to contribute, but, uh--Freddy Riedenschneider--
Uh-huh.
Huh? No.
Crane. Ed Crane.
Hello.
Ah-hah. It would be best if he waited here.
They sent us to tell ya.
Visiting ends at five. Too late today. You can see her tomorrow.
I'm in.
We've been operating in the red for years.  That was the whole idea behind the Superstition Exhibit.  It was designed to pull people in. We've spent every penny we have on advance publicity, betting everything on the opening's success. If we postpone at the last minute... No.  I don't want to think about that.
Where's the walk-in safe?
What's the combination?
Calm down.  I found it!
Let's go!
Like hell!
Special Agent Pendergast.  FBI.
Correct.
Apparently it's huge.
What is it?
I know.
Someone who makes the Hacksaw Murderer look like Mother Teresa.
We can't do without you.  You're one of the foremost authorities on primitive pharmacology.  You're practically an institution around here.
Your work is highly relevant.  What about your display on Primitive Pharmacology?  Cuthbert told me himself he was going to feature it prominently in the Superstition Exhibit.
I'm not giving up.
You are this museum.  It won't be the same without you.
Cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success.  The museum is in debt.  Contributions and public funding have dried up.  Admissions no longer cover overhead.  The last big infusion of cash we had was the King Tut exhibit.  Cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red.  If the Superstition Exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.
I'm not sure.  As you know, the Kothoga lived outside civilization on the tepui for thousands of years. Species flourished in isolation when man and pollution rendered them extinct.  This could be one of the last remaining samples of an unknown plant.
Let's not jump to conclusions.  This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
That's not so unusual.  Many plants carry viruses.  Like the burls on Maple trees.
Quadrupedal!  The other name for Mbwun.  "He Who Walks on All Fours."
Margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.
Some kind of power failure.  Maybe it's the storm.  Do you have a flashlight?
We can't.  We've managed to get inside the one place that's safe.  I think we should sit tight and wait for reinforcements.  If we go outside, we're risking more lives. You have to accept it, Margo, there's nothing we can do.  The building must be swarming with police by now.  It won't take long for them to get through the doors.
We will.
Happy to be useful.  It's rare enough these days.  According to security, Beauregard put the Whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.
I don't believe it.
They were sent to the Center For Disease Control in Atlanta.
Big as a house.
Well almost.  Depends which house.  It smelled like old hamburger, and it made this weird noise.
They were green eyes and they were slit like a lizard's.
The dogs have lost the scent, Mr. Pendergast.  Maybe we should head back.
Holy mother, what is that?
Not on the map.  Looks like it connects with the city sewer.
Another storage room.
But at what a price.
Lizard DNA and human DNA on the same strand?  Impossible.  The sample must be contaminated.
You have time to talk?
You were afraid of him, weren't you?
I don't think so.  I think we were meant to think it was Mbwun.  Did Whittlesley's monster have claws?
I don't know.
You were behind me?  Running after me?
I don't know.  Mr. Pendergast.  Do me a favor.  Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
No.  I think I'm hallucinating.
It's not supernatural.  Mbwun is an animal.  Part lizard, part human, a genetic freak of some kind, like the half-goat, half-sheep they found last year in the jungles of Vietnam.
We have the fibers.  Don't you see? The creature is hungry.  It wants the hormones in these plants.  It would take hundreds of human brains to supply what's in these fibers.  We're just a poor substitute.  To make it stop hunting, we have to give it what it wants.
The planetarium!
No.  The planetarium is in the next cell.  This is one of the fire doors...
Its eyesight is worse than I thought.  It couldn't see us.  And it couldn't smell us through the glass.
How?
I have to shoot.
One.
We <i>have</i> had our close calls in the past.
--a dead one at that.
As you know ratings have never been our primary goal.  I imagine we'll lose those voyeurs only interested in witnessing Truman's latest torment.  However, I'm certain that our core audience will remain loyal.
All products carefully chosen and tested by you for quality and aesthetic value.
Guess I always thought they'd adopt.
So when are you leaving?
Sure.  It's halogen.  Shame it didn't hit you - you could've sued.  You coming for a drink?
Your Dad?!
It's a lot of world for one man.  You sure that's not wishful thinking, you wishing you'd made something more of yourself? Christ, Truman, who hasn't sat on the John and had an imaginary interview on "Seahaven Tonight"?  Who hasn't wanted to be somebody?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
It's a surprise.
I've been thinking--
I made macaroni.
You blaming me for the traffic?
There's been an accident, Truman.
I'm sure they're just exaggerating.
Why do you want to have a child with me? You can't stand me.
Do something...
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
Hold on a minute, dear.  Here's us at Mount Rushmore.  You remember, Truman--when Dad was still with us - that was quite a drive.  You slept all the way there.
Not bad.  I just won the State Lottery.
We don't even know you.
Me?
Nothing completely conclusive --
Technically and biologically, though he'll never recover.
No. No...we need to try our vaccine on it.
Incinerate it. Like the others.
No. Don't bother.
Yeah, I did.
I came on my own. After reading about the bombing in Dallas.
Michaud was a patriot. The men he's loyal to know their way around Dallas. They blew that building to hide something. Maybe something even they couldn't predict.
You said the firemen and the boy were found in the temporary offices of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Why?
Yeah, well I don't have them all.
I've been using you?!
I told you -- he and I were old friends --
Your ass? I just got chased across Texas by two black helicopters.
What happened to playing a hunch?
The element of surprise, Scully. Random acts of unpredictability. If we fail to anticipate the unforeseen or expect the unexpected in a universe of infinite possibilities, we find ourselves at the mercy of anyone or anything that cannot be programmed, categorized or easily referenced...
No you didn't.
I'm in the vending room.
Mulder. Move away from the door. We're coming through it.
I meet with the OPR day after tomorrow for remediation and reassignment...
They're not doing this, Mulder.  I left behind a career in medicine because I thought I might make a difference at the FBI. When they recruited me they told me women made up nine percent of the bureau. I felt this was not an impediment, but an opportunity to distinguish myself. But it hasn't turned out that way. And now, if I were to be transferred to Omaha, or Wichita or some field office where I'm sure I could rise, it just doesn't hold the interest for me it once did. Not after what I've seen and done.
According to this tag.
You're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. That this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.
We're being blamed for these deaths. Scully, I want to know what this man died of. Don't you?
It looks pretty green for this climate.
All the equipment is brand new.
I don't know, Mulder.
That's the first question to answer, if we're going to find them.
-- of what exactly?!
Pounding down some dirt road in the middle of the night. Chasing some elusive truth on a dim hope, only to find myself standing right where I am right now: at another dead end --
I hear the humming. Like electricity. High voltage maybe.
I don't know.
We're close to something here -- we're on the verge --
I need you on this, Scully --
You saved me, Scully.  As different and frustrating as it's been sometimes, your goddamn strict rationalism and science have saved me a thousand times; have kept me honest and made me whole. I owe you so much, Scully, and you owe me nothing.  I don't want to do this without you. I don't know if I can. If I quit now, they win.
I think you're in anaphylactic shock --
General McAddie's.
But it's not the lives we saved. It's the lives we didn't.
I breached protocol. I broke contact with the S.A.C. I ignored a primary tactical rule and left him alone with the device.
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
That's why you bombed the building. The infected firemen, the boy --
No one believes Kurtzweil or his books. He's a toiler. A crank.
You need not kill a man to destroy him.
Why not?  Just once.  A trial run.  What harm could it do?
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
And he might blame you for terrifying him.  That one moment could erase all you've accomplished.  And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
I don't need them anymore...
Give a kiss to Edward.
As far as I needed.
You don't know the procedure.
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality?  Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act.  We're all human.
Little boy?!  That's him!
Give her a minute.  Hello, Valentine.
All yours.  My boss says it's one of the strangest requests the Bureau's ever had.
No problem.
What's wrong?
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
Yes.  But you're going to sit down right now.  I have to...
Thanks you.  Six weeks off does a body good.  I heard she got the approval to try the reversal with Edward.
Awaiting his arrival.
It's his dog.
Let's give old Carl a call.  Tell him he's got company.
Ja, ja, ja.
Do you understand German?
I was talking to another friend of Harry's. A Baron Kurtz - do you know him?
In German?
Comedy. I don't play tragedy.
What's that?
Oh, let me see. No, no that's not the cue. It means she has to sit down.
I'm so sorry.
Be sensible - tell Major Calloway.
Why?
I knew him for twenty years - at least I thought I knew him. I suppose he was laughing at fools like us all the time.
There isn't enough for two laughs.
Oh...
How did you know I would be here?
I saw him today.
Why are you lying?
If you want to sell your service, I'm not willing to be the price... I loved him. You loved him. What good have we done him. Look at yourself, they have names for faces like that.
Thank you.
We loved each other, do you mean that?
Two weeks ago.
I don't know.
I don't want it.
Just around the corner.
Holly Martins.
I can't say that I have.
What are you trying to say?
Calloway - I'm English, not Irish.
Getting around, Martins.
Calloway.
I see.
She's right. It's none of my business.
You all did.
I said you win.
Two thirty.
Oh, Mr. Martins...
I'll tell you what, Mr. Martins. On Wednesday night at our institute, we are having a little lecture on the contemporary novel...I thought perhaps you'd like to speak.
Nonsense. Your novels are very popular here. Aren't they, Sergeant?
Goodness, that's awkward.
Good evening Mr. Crabbin.
Oh, I thought you would know, you're a writer. Of course you do. Good night, old man.
Of course, of course, of course.
Yes, Hindu dances, thank you, Sergeant. This is the first opportunity we've had of making an American author welcome.
Very popular. Are you staying long?
Yes.
It's good to see you, Holly.
I remember when they raided the gambling joint - you know a safe way out...
Only his doctor, Dr. Winkel.
What's the good of another post mortem? Suppose you dig up something - well - discreditable to Harry?
Vinkel.
I understand...
Mr. Lime - yes.
und ich kann nicht alle kennen.
You saw it?
Yes.
Funny?
Help you out?
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
So how many miles do you think it is?
I don't know, just a fin. Over there. About a hundred meters.
Yes.
Nothing. I just thought you ought to know.
I'm sorry.
Fuck off.
Eh - bonsoir.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don’t try then we'll never know.
We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us....
I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau....
Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is.  Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!!
The Zionists aren't Nazis.
They sound like you.
Are you shitting me?? Right in the store?
Then I won't bring you....
Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he --
Fire...
No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush?  Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews.
I have a job.
I don't care about money.
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed.
You want it to be an event.
Yes, I am. Basically I am.
Oh, really?
Then how come you're talking to me?
I stole it. From a synagogue.
That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter.
No.
What do you care?
What's it mean?
Why?
Why not?
Even though his dick is so big?
V'asitem...
Nothing but nothingness...Judaism's not about belief.
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God....  The book's closed.
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
And be crushed.
You gotta get out of here.
I don't. I was just curious how full of shit you were.
Who's Eichmann?!!?
It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been.
I've been waiting all my life for something like this.
Sexuality??? What do you mean?
Does that mean the Jew is the better lover?
He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988.
So you're saying it's not true.
Listen to me....
Yes. Infinitely more. They would become as God.
No.
Get the fuck away from me.
The arguments, anyway.
With the shoes... There was more than one?
A forty-five.
Fucking kike.
It's German.
From the Rhineland originally.
Curtis is afraid you'll marginalize us.
Fine.
That damn thing. You know how it made me look...?
It'll be enough if we use it right.  Okay, the service'll go about another hour. Say an hour for the janitors, then one more just to be safe... We'll go in at midnight.
Seven-thirty tomorrow evening.
Yeah, hey, how're you doing...
Wow, that's uh...great...
Four. But no one this important.
Okay, that's it. You're going back to --
Dennis Leary.
No.
Funny?
And that's when the Mets started to stink.
As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes...
Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
But your man isn't quite a God!
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
... So am I.
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
Hello!
In a lake.
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare".  You see I was right in getting you out here.  You're a world champion, my friend!
I won't, I swear.
No.  Jacques is a creature of the sea.  He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
You really think so?  Did you tell him you were pregnant?
The fool was asleep!  If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
Very chic.  Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
I didn't say...  Brussels!
It's nothing.  It's just the helium, because of the air pressure.
What room have you got?
Yes, of course.  Lots of questions.
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule!  I was engaged... for a week.  After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
... Yes.
Long enough to die.  Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
... I was right about what?
... Okay.  I'll try.
I thought it was a nice place.  Isn't it?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Uh... Yes, of course!
I did?
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
I'm still here.
... It's hard you know.  You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
... Nothing.
You go back, I'll walk.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
He doesn't hear too well.
Well... here.
Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively.
Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of.
He must be behind that curtain. Relax. We're undercover. We need to give off the appearance of calm. You see Esther, the trick to undercover work is to try and blend in. Act as a Gentile would.
C'mon follow me.
No. It's not like that. You're being completely neurotic. I was just playing along...
When I play bridge with all the girls, everyone has what to talk about with their sons. They show pictures. Their sons are lawyers and doctors and Rabbis. Why can't I show a picture?
No. No. We're gonna argue. And you know what mom? I'm going to save Hanukkah just to spite you. And when my face is all over the television. When your friends are opening their Hanukkah gifts next year, don't mention it to them, okay? I wouldn't want you to have to show my picture.
Mom, why don't you put that cat out of its misery?
Mazel Tov!
I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years.
But wait, there's more. With a few swift clicks of this hand-computer interface, commonly referred to as a mouse, I can download illicit pornographic material and even send it along to a friend via a cyber postal route known as e-mail.
Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall.
The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound.
Offscreen gunfire. That Jewish Atomic Clock stuff ate up a lot of our budget.
Everything's kosher. Watch him for me.
If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt.
Why not?
I don't know —-
You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
Look, Charlie, just be patient. I'll fix everything. You don't want that cat, anyway. It killed two people.
You'll meet a rich man and he will give, you money.
Watch and see, A day or a week - but certainly this month -- you will have money from a man and then-
Who?
You must say that you went to take some of the roses to your father's grave...
Rosita —— I have wondered -—
She's a local. When the dudes come out to New Mexico, they went to wallow in Latin glamour. This is a bad town for blondes.
You're lucky. I wish he'd front page for me.
Good evening.
Sure -- certainly —- but what's that got to do with this?
Caged animals are unpredictable. They're like frustrated human beings. I can't answer your question.
It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
Don't you want to see the rest of the exhibit?
Not! I tell you. No!
Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
There's a little museum here in town. They've hired me to run it, We've some interesting exhibits of Indian arts and crafts. It's fun -- and I like living here in New Mexico.
I'm sure if you are as talented as you are charming, Miss Walker, you have nothing to worry about.
No —- really, I can see them -- they're coming now -— turn off the lights ——
Something's wrong with this whole setup --
Let me get one thing clear. Did Galbraith make a direct accusation?
Kiki -- he won't hurt you. There's nothing to be afraid of.
I thought -— is Kiki just going to walk on that floor tonight walk out cold before a bunch of gawks who think a Spanish twirler is the greatest thing in life. No. Not my favorite client. She's going to make an entrance  this town will never forget.
Yeah.
Do they close up every year for this Processionist business?
He's a nice guy. Vie ought to keep in touch with him.
Robles says it looks that way. Belmonte had already been there and left. They only missed each other by a few minutes.
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
If that's being a softie -- there are two of us.
I'm no detective. I don't even know how to begin. All I know is I want to do something about all this.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
What! You can't be --
We ought to dare to tell each other everything, Kiki -- you and I.
Maybe for the same reason that made someone somewhere not consider this a spot to build the Getty Museum...
You a tourist?
I am Lawrence, sir. Mr and Mrs De Moraes’ majordomo. They are expecting you.
When will they be back?
You will have to ask Mr De Moraes that, sir.  Would you like a drink while you wait?
Dial O-O-O on the telephone if you change your mind about the drink, sir.
What... What are you talking about?
Excuse me?
Couldn’t Nazi hunters do the job?
You do want me to keep the job, don’t you, Mrs De Moraes?
Have you got a pen?
Why don’t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Something like that.
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
The dead can wait.
A call box? That’s odd. Where exactly?
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Croissants. Like that...
I’m fine standing, thank you.
Lombard...  It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I’d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
Who’s the guy? Who’s the guy! Nom de Dieu!  Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I’d have had to kill him.
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
Italian? The Mafia...?
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
Emily...
She’ll be alright. She’s tough...
This is a bad line.
What sort have you got?
What about an untrained pup, white...
Tomorrow?
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
...On holiday?
Who?  Martin... He’s Martin...
The company. We all work for the company.
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He’s got a safe...  I need a doctor...
I’ll call again.
Can I have the reception desk, please.
I certainly did, sir...
La what?
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many. 
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, très bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommandémes services àquelqu’un récemment... Vous êtes certain... Non, non...  Je vous remercie... 
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn’t like to think I’d kept you waiting for nothing.
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Anything at all?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Look, I don’t think you’re fully aware of what you’re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don’t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
This is the hotel supervisor, Mr Lamont. I’m terribly sorry to disturb you but there’s been a mix-up with our bookings which you might be able to help us resolve.
I don’t recollect mentioning a friend.
Shut up!
Did Leon tell you why he didn’t want the police involved, Rhian?
Do you know Leon’s parents names?
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Yes...You-you’re not going to take Shiva away?
Tu sais où me trouver.
Figlio di puttana. You’re the French asshole who bumped off the London guys...
Fuck...
What do you think, huh?
Shut up and walk...
It’s a good guess...
Very generous of you all.  How much?
No.  I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
Now?
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
To marry you.
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
It would not be the same without you.
Not yet!
I want to stay with you...
I made no such promise.  Sound the retreat for the night!
And so I... I prefer my banner.
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
Well what are you waiting for? You've got a castle full of racks and ropes and pulleys:  go and torture the bitch!
Scared of a girl?
What about you?
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Yes.  They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
In a village called Domremy.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Not unless you hear my confession.
Many things...
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Buying her?
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty?  Do you enjoy it?  All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
I know... but the English want her very badly, and I have to tell you that they are proving much more generous.
20,000 gold crowns.
I must offer to the Duke.  I will give you his answer tomorrow.
I know...
For what?
Jeanne, with respect -- we can't just attack the Tourelles like that -- it's a very complicated matter and...
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
We need another ten minutes...
Calm yourself, Xaintrailles.  Now slowly.  Who has finally done what?
As long as she brings food and supplies, she'll be welcome.
Me too...
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
But the bridge has been pulled down!
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Jeanne, look behind you.
But my voices... they promised me...
No...
No...!
That's now what I meant...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Yes, but...
Hey, my friend!  I'm glad to see your ugly damn face again!
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
I'd sooner die than use magic!
... the smell of victory, Jeanne! Mmmmmmm!  I love it!
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
I -- I -- I...
They're going to come and visit you in here?
I want to see that.  Do you mind if I stay... on the side?  I won't bother you.
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
So your memory's coming back?
In His name??
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
Do you think this cross will protect you?
Do you think you are ready?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
I need to confess again.
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Yes, it is.
A singer. Her husband's an actor. I knew them well. Good people. I'd like to talk to her.
Oh, yes. I remember.
You know something? Meeting you like that was absolutely wonderful.
Wladek, please.
How will we sleep?
Yes, but sometimes I'm still not sure which side of the wall I'm on.
What's happened?
I haven't seen him.
Who told you?
That makes a change.
You're out, aren't you?
I didn't grovel, I asked him to help.
Pay him? With what? With what could I pay him? Every zloty I earn we spend on food!
Yes, so did the Germans.
Yes, but what good did it do?
There are always notices going up.
I didn't know you were in the certificate business.
Cow!
Pack, Wladek, there's no time.
God forbid!
Stop it, Wladek.
Don't thank me. Thank God. It's His will that we should survive. Well. That's what we have to believe.
Tell me your name. I'll listen out for you.
That is good, yes.
The Alps.
Ohhh ... dear. Not another word From the shock, yes it would be.
Yes, it's unholy.
No, no bible readers.
I'll be back.
Yes, I thought that.
Te, kawnarna paraikete mo te tahi hawlie 0 te whenna uci.  UNSUBTITLED
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
They are washed.
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
That's right.
Who told ya this guy was in here?
What's the line on Visitation?
He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
How bout you?  I'll give you the whole hundred!
What are you talkin' about?  We just took off the biggest score we've ever had.  We can do anything we want now.
Believe me, the Man's gonna be real happy.  Looks like we cleared over ten grand this week.
Yeh, Luther said you could teach me something.  I already know how to drink.
Why?
We'll get by without 'em.
If we ever get to it.
Well we got some workin' money anyway.
What do ya mean?
Did he say he wouldn't?
Wonder why he doesn't fly both ways.
We'll give him the hook on the train, and play him here.  You think I can get in that poker game, Eddie?
See ya and raise three.
You scored blood money today, Hooker.  You need a friend.
Then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.
Yes, a ticket to Chicago.
Where's June today?
Where you goin'?
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
No.  They're just the only ones we know of.
Three grand on the black, Jimmy.
I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
This is just a test.  The big one comes later.  Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
Not yet, but...  Hey, there's only a grand here.
I'll make parole.
If it works again tomorrow, I'll have a half million in cash here by noon the next day.  We split 60-40.
We missed him.
Wouldn't that be too bad.  You'd hafta move outa this nice office ya got.
He'll never do it.
No.
Right back to California.  We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
You know how they are... sex...
Is that what it means?
Look -- those are the first metals that came through. 
That is, if it's all right with you.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman... 
Oh, Andy, Andy!
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
He wouldn't say.
tried him once -
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks.  Why don't you drop around?
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Which way did she fall?
He's been dead for three months.
Yes, she would.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
And he still wants to marry me!
Better get home before it is.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Not a thing.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up.  Then we seen him...  ...sneak in and we decide to come up.  And pretty lucky for you.
What'd he think it was to you?
I'm asking you.
No.
I'll have to try to remember.
You mean about that gun?
I think we're on the right track.
I never saw him.  I don't think anyone saw him.
When was that?
I see.
Why yes.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Let him have his say out.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
I guess all the suspects are here.
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
What bonds?
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.
Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
Never mind.
Is Julia going with you?
That's all right.  What are you drinking?
I haven't been a detective for four years.
What about it, Tanner.  Isn't that the truth?
Hello, Mimi.
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York.  Hire one of them.
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it.  Now you take Dorothy home and...
Yes...
Gilbert!  Is he here too?  We might as well be living in the lobby.
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table.  You may serve the fish.
You're lying, Mimi.  But then, you'd do anything for money.  You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will.  Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
I didn't knock Julia off.
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her.  She was always on the up and up with me.  But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
This is your party.
He's well-trained.  He'll behave himself.
If you like 'em like that.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.  Dorothy is really my daughter.  You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young.  I didn't know what I was doing.  We were all like that on my father's side.
Much better, thanks.
That last Martini.
What are you drinking?
There's nothing I can do to help her.
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
Well, didn't you?
Yes.  I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Yes.
Let's see.  Where's it from?
Your guess is as good as mine.
I don't believe he did it.
Looks like a hold-up!
I don't know...  This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Not with all your money!
I did find him!
It was his body that was buried there.
Yup.  Don't you want something to eat?
Several things.  Hello, Fred.  We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions.  Oh, and coffee.
Oh.  Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed.  The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Got a nice evening dress?
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town.  The watch chain was handed over....  ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something.  Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
I had a key. I worked here... till they closed the shop.
Yes.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
You did.
Not up to us.  Up to the Iraqis.  All they have to do is get out of Kuwait.
We're going to keep driving.
Wha...
You just go when I say go.
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here.  Worn down to nothing now.
Let me see the map.
You've had your say, Wes.  Now leave it.
Maybe I do.
I told you.  He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
Suppose I don't go for that?
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth.  It's just the Shi'ites don't know that.  I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
Tell me something, Wes.  Are you crazy, greedy, or just stupid?  Jaeger says you're crazy.
If I give it to you, will you let us go?
Knock it off!
Ready for what?  What are you supposed to be doing?
What we're doing is kicking ass.  For God's sake they got Iraqis surrendering to news crews.  The war is over.  We've just got to keep shooting people 'cause the army spent all this money, and we've got to put on a show for the taxpayers.
Roger that.
Oh, that's fun.
Wh-what do you think--
I didn't miss it.  I figured if you knew one of the reserves got hit you'd want to turn back.
I heard it click.
We're going to get off, all right.  We'll get you off of there.  Just...be cool.
Me and Wes are just going to talk.
I said be cool, all right?  Now be cool!
You're not going to let me die, are you!? Don't let me die!
If we step on a mine we'll know it was. Let me see the maps.
The Shi'ites are on our side?  I didn't know that.
So good bye, Shi'ites.  Thanks for playing.  We have some lovely parting gifts for you as you go.
Something like that.
Stay low.
We're not going to do anything.
So where do we start?
What does it look like I'm doing?
What's to stop him if he wanted to?  All he has to do is cut the line...
Jesus, Jaeger.
Northeast?  That's away from the Hummer; further into Iraqi.
We'll find our way.
Is it all right if I stand up?
Yeah.  Well, me too.
It's got to be going better than this..
It's a desert.  That's what deserts do at night; they get cold.
No!
Hell, they'll probably just surrender to us.  Probably.
We keep going, that's what we do.  We ignore them, maybe they ignore us.
Shi'ites, I think.
But...
Thought you were going to buy a car.
He'll slow down.
A headache?
Naw, nothing.
What's your point, Wes?  You have a point?
What!?
Come on, man.  I almost had this thing open.
You know it's real.  You know it's real, and you know it's there.  You know it.
Hell, we'll just buy our way out.
Oh, no.
...I figured...I figured you'd turn back.
You have to go with us.  You can't walk back...
Doesn't matter.  We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
Until we're out of the mine field is how long.
That don't mean nothing.  Iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Guess we know what the next stop is.
He's a soldier.  He doesn't need a weapon.  He's got rocks.  He's got bare hands.
Correct.  Origin?
Vocasity
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
Eat your dinner.
Now.
I didn't.  You asked me about the card.  You're going to get us into trouble.
That's not food.  Can't be food.
What?...Oh, no, THX.  That's not true.  Not satisfied?  THX, I need you so much.
No!  Don't go.
I don't want to lose you.
You don't know.  You don't....
No!...No!...
What are you talking about? When did you sleep last?  Do you know what your trouble is? You're blind.  You've been here so long you can't see what is happening.  We must unite.  We need unity.  We need action. ) We have come to a time when we must....
THX and me.
I wonder how far he went.  He's gathered invaluable information out there.
It may seem ridiculous to the untrained mind, but if you were able to interpret the calculations you would see that an apparent paradox is actually a perfect and elegant system in concept and design.
Where is LUH?
I want you for my roommate.
What?
Look more closely.
Too late....stay close.
No......  She's dead THX........
....going well.  How could I be so wrong.  SCO 1202 cross wired a 904.  He's been receiving extra credit.  He offered me some.
My mate has been acting very strange.  I can't explain it.....but.  I haven't been feeling very well myself.  I don't know, maybe it's me.  I needed an SP9 last night.  I feel as if something odd were happening to me. Something....
You are a true believer.  Blessings of the state, blessings of the masses.  Thou art a subject of the divine.  Created in the image of man, by the masses, for the masses. Let us be thankful we have an occupation to fill.  Work hard; increase production; prevent accidents, and be happy.
Yes...
Officer Reilly, vice.
You the Bomb Squad?
Off a girl's wrist. A suspect...
Thanks.
When you need us, you love us, when you don't, we're shunned by the rest of the department.
Mike Reilly.
So you're the "Device Squad"... and you defuse "devices"?
Anything else I should know?
Hey, look--
Oh yeah? Prove it.
Just how easy is it to build a... device?
Be right back.
Catch that alert? That's him in the U-Haul.
You got it.
Off the scale.
He has a timer going as back-up, in case we got a hold of the remote.  Okay... first, run your fingers along the edges, feel for a sensor.
Don't touch that.
That's the blasting cap - good! Okay, now grab it by the base and pull it straight up. No, Wait...
Easy, guys.  
Call upstairs, see what you can find out.
T.J., run a trace on this, see if you can pin down where it came from. Whoever these people are, let's hope they're all talk.
We work fast enough for you?
Exactly my thinking. Except, none of the targets can actually be linked to government, political or special interest concerns. They seem to be just unrelated industrial companies. Some insured, some not. 
Hope you don't mind, Captain, might help us catch these guys that much sooner.  Coming?
Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
Meg's lasagna. Good eats, Reilly. C'mon.
Thank you.
Nothing... just tired.
What? Nobody, I-
Take him!
You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
A ticking bomb...
Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
No shit. I better send Meg flowers just in case.
Scorch marks... looks like they used silly putty.
Fuck factor ten.
What?
Captain assigned me to assist you.
He's married, he don't even know what a lesbian is.
I promised her she'd be safe.
I know.
Fire me later. Close in and we got the bastard.
And diamonds in the front.
At once, Jacques.  We'll continue later.
A man in love, completely shaken. He sits on bed, thinks, then takes telephone slowly, decisively.
<u>All</u> <u>kinds</u>.
Good morning.  I'd-I'd-I'd like to look at some cuff links.
The type they marry.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy.  Beginnings are always difficult.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron.
Yes, Baron?
Yes, Baron. Thank you. 
Just a second.
I hope so, too.
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
Otherwise I'll call the police
What do you mean?
I know it!
Now just a minute, Major--
No--no.
Why should you?
Thank you.
I'm crazy about you.  By the way, your pin.
Last year? It can't be that long.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
Ah!
Certainly!
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
Yes.
I know that niche.
Not particularly.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Oh! You didn't read it!
Oh!
M'sieu Laval!
Too much blue in crimson.
Yes!
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
How do you like my dress?
Correct!  Good night.
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
How much is your salary?
Thank you, Rose.
A hundred and one next month.
Don't drop it Rose.
Don't you mean work me?
There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
I was tired.
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...  ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other.  Search him.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!
Of course not. That's not the point.  Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
If you don't shut that hole in yer face, there'll be one less in this boat!
No.
You're crazy.
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
You're welcome. Rose.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
If only it were that simple.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
She had beautiful hands.
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Sure. If you like.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
Sssshh. Come here.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
He does landscapes.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
We'll find out.
Get in the boat, Rose.
It's so cold.
Yes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind.
We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
Charmed, I'm sure.
It's so unfair.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
This is Miss Marsh.
I can explain--
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
--and I can tell you where to get off.
Will you leave me alone?
Glad to see you again.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
I don't understand.
Montana?
Guess again, copper.
And me coming in with two pair-- 
Want to take it back?
I'd <U>like</U> to be.  Sailing on the <U>Progress?</U>
Yes--
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
Well, I can't.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
At seven-thirty?
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
Jimmy!
I thought you were a smart guy.
No bank roll there, boy.  Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
I'll watch for him, sir.
How're the tips?
Come on--  I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
I'll take one. 
Get it!
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
Much better--thank you--
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Why?
Hey!--you're tickling me.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
Why, I--
Thanks. That makes us square.
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Sure.
How?
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
Back is in New York.
Send that.
She's in New York.
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
No--not much--excepting-- 
No--Inexperienced--  A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
I'll never love anybody else.
Of course--but--  There's your cue--hurry up--
What do you mean?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
All right. When <U>is</U> a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
Good-night, folks.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
The country boy's about due.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
About twelve hundred.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
Not a chance--I'm through. 
This is interesting--  Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Good night!
Thank you.
You saw him sitting out there in front, didn't you?
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Isn't that a daisy?
Just this minute.  I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Beauty, ain't he?
And you must be Doc Holliday.
Good.  That's real good.
This brand.
Well... 'bye.
No...
Yes, but there's just something About him.  Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me.  No.  I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
Better.
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Depends how you look at it.  I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
Sorry, sorry...
Felt his liver go on that last One.  Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it.  He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it.  And it drives him mad. Sick mad.  Cold and dirty.
What does he want?  He wants revenge.
Hurts.  Hurts pretty bad.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion?  Watch your ear, Creek.
Awful lot of money.
You're the doctor.  sad news, friend.
What was that all about?
What?
Good God, you're really-
All right Wyatt, maybe you can. But you gotta die to do it. Understand?  You gotta die!
Colorado's closer
He's right, Wyatt.  Ringo could Put five into you before you Could even get one into him.
It rides right at 'em.  Like McMasters said, see it through to The end.
Easy now... That mare's in season.
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
Where do you get these questions?
How would you know?
Well you're different, no arguing That.  But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense.  I almost can't look at You.  Like it hurts.
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
Fortuitous even.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
I can't, I'm sorry.  Forgive me.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
Let me have one of those cigars.  Kinda nice in here.  You run it?
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now.  I guess I could stay a little while.
No really, I can stay a while.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
No?  Brothers to the bone, right?
So he can tell the story.
They're wise by now.  Which is Next, Iron Springs?  Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
Got me.  Somethin'.  Nothin'.  I Don't know.
Lotta law around here.  Just met the Sheriff.
Just his style, Morg.  Doesn't Mean anything.
What're you talkin' about?
That didn't sound like thunder.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Yeah.  It's a fact.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Listen Mister, I'm getting' tired-
Jack...
But she doted on the frowner
Kinda, actually, yeah.  I gotta admit.
Virgil, please.  Don't do this to me.
Nothing to do with me?  I'm your Brother for Christ's sake.  God, I Don't believe this.  Talk to him, will you?  Or hit him.  Oh no, don't tell me...
Ah, now that's the real mother- Lode in Tombstone.  Up and down Allen Street, full-blast 24 hours A day, liquor, hostesses, Gamblin', makin' money hand over Fist.  All except the Oriental.  On Account of the element.  Have a Man for breakfast in there most Days.  Regular slaughter house. High-rollers won't go near it. Too bad, nice place.
Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but -  You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you.
Good-bye, Mister Bond.
Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
I appreciate your time -
Ah, James. You always were a cunning linguist... Au revoir, mon cher.
Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter!
Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy -  Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide.
Is this another one of your games?
No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans -  You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
Do you?
He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image.  You've got to protect me!
Political considerations?
Q's retirement party. I'd just put the knife into the cake, and -
I see...
If you can't do the time, don't do the crime?
Hey - the world is my office.
Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation.
I envy your 'undercover' assignments.
I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
I hope so.
He was my father's best friend!
The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator.
Up.
... We have time for that?
...You know, that's another reason you're probably not in a successful relationship.
Now.
I have an excellent teacher.  'Make sure you wear the uniform'?
Ja-shwa tsway. These are lips.
Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney.
Aye-aye sir. Engines to half.
Excellent.
Approaching the first gate.
Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target -
No sir! I swear! This is not true!!
I don't know. He's not in the database -
I hadn't forgotten. I ordered some cloth but it didn't come in and I felt so bad if I would have come to her birthday without that, I just stayed at home.
You all don't believe me when I tell you I'm afraid of heights.
Why are you always afraid to get somewhere?
I don't see you crying about my drinking it.
I preached to Mom and Dad about it but they are stuck in their ways, it's like talking to a brick. But if there is a way...
Babe Brother.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
Anytime you need someone to do something for you, just let me know.
We grow most of our own food. The money I get from social security, my pension and my wife's work, keeps us living on the edge. What choice do people like us have.
Hush.
Hush.
It would be nice.
No, I'm too hot now.
What happened to your hand?
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
He kind of favors one of my boys when he was about his age.
I'm going to wash up now. You all please excuse me.
I was going to get up and get a hen out there for dinner, but time got away.
It was slow. Now it seems like everyone is having births at home.
'Course, you could be right. Your sons are alive. All my sons are dead.
You should go back and rest.
Tolerable well.
You just run along. I'll fix him his soup. He will be all right.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Week by week the crowds at the door keeps getting larger. We can't feed all the hungry.
Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
"Out of weariness, I spoke to my own heart; to leave it all and to die. And I gave my heart to know madness and folly."
Ya, but you can't do the shuffle with one leg. You and your wife, in your spare time, work with the less fortunate. Now I'm not talking about you and what you do but some folks that always run to help the victim, deep down are attracted to pain and suffering and love to be near the dying.
Everybody who have been associated with Harry end up with pennies over their eyes.
Don't shout!
Whether the boy hears it or not, the man is still a jackass. Everyone should have some mother wit.
Whadda ya think?
Now go get Molly.  Your friends are going to be here any minute.
Oh, yeah!
You can bring ONE toy...
No, I haven't seen him.
But Mom, I can't find him!
Sure!  I'll even let you drive.
But what if we leave them behind?
Let's let Molly open one.
Watch yourself!!
Okay then, Mr. Lightbeer!  Prove it.
That wasn't flying!  That was falling with style!
Where?
Nothing that concerns you spacemen. Just us TOYS.
But we're not on my planet, are we?
YOU are the one that decided to climb into this --
Oh, great, great.  Yeah, and if anyone attacks us we can blink 'em to death.
I'll tell you what's -- AAAAH!
Oh, you idiot!  You're a toy!  Use your karate chop action!
Hey!!  Hey!  How are you doing that? Stop that!
Don't you get it?!  You see the hat? I am Mrs. Nesbit!! 
Come on, Sheriff.  There's a kid over in that house who needs us. Now let's get you out of this thing.
We've got to get out of here...NOW.
Woody!
Hold still, Buzz!
Not today!
Now Buzz, what could Andy possibly get that is worse than you?!
Oh, what?!...What?!  These are plastic.  He can't fly!
Sorry there, old Spudhead.
How 'bout three out of five?
Oh no, Hannah!
Look!  Janie!
Patient is...  ...pre-e-epped.
Who would've thought he was capable of such atrocities?!
How did I get stuck with YOU as a moving buddy?
That's Mr. Potato Head to you, you back-stabbin' murderer!
No, no, no!  You got it all wrong, Potato Head.  Buzz is fine!  Buzz is right here.  He's with me!
Yes!  Yes!  We promise!
Hey, Woody!?  Where'd ya go?
Wait!  There's a nice little one over there!
Woody?  Who's up there with you?
Yes SIR!
Last present!
Just stay where you are, Corporal! Don't move, Carl.  You'll blow up. I know you're tired!  I know your leg is cramping, but you can't move. Do you hear me?
Huh?
Got it.
Excuse me.
I didn't know about the puppets. It's a lot to take in, all at once.
Home is where the heart is.
Get away from me...
Is that all?
Finn -
It was only a mouthful!
So did I.
So had I.
Is she in any kind of therapy... professional help?
I can't find Manolo.
He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money.
I want to believe you.  I really do.
Arnie, this is crazy.
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
It's the same.  What happened to what they gave you?
I just didn't want to take a chance. I didn't want to risk it.  It could have been frozen along with everything else.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments.  I tried --
Six months.  I found some marijuana, that's all.  And a little pipe about two inches long.  I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
The first thing we have to do is present a unified front.
Not yet.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents.  I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
How?  Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home?  Do you have any idea what is happening out here?  Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien.  Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging.  Nobody will help us.  Nobody will take us in.  Nobody wants anything to do with us.  So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me.  Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
Will we get invited to the White House?
Yes.
Yeah.
What is this, like freebase?
I feel good.
She ain't in on it.
I love my job.  I love it.  The next time I'm having a bad day you gotta remind me of right now and I'll get over it.
Oh, man, I've never eaten so good in my life.  Why don't you develop a useful skill?
We're playing!
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
There's always a way.  If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
Nobody said shit, Eduardo --
You can't visit me here.  I want my lawyer.
Carl and I were friends from childhood.  He was loyal, that's not a mistake.
That's crazy.  My husband is on trial for smuggling.
They wouldn't do it in front of all these people.  They'd send someone later, when we're alone.
She's nosy.  She hears me on the telephone.
The police won't find your car.
Then I guess I'm going by myself.
What?
Javier Rodriguez.
It's possible.
Any idea how much?
I have money --
I'll pay you a thousand dollars.  I have it in my wallet.
She hasn't called you?
We sometimes went downtown to score.
You want to help?  Stay the fuck away from her.
Addicts treat themselves... they overdose and then there's one less to worry about.
Agents who died in the field.
What do you mean?
Your dad's a doctor.  Call him --
No. On you go.
Bit fucking late, like.
Because I fucking told you to do that, you doss cunt.
You daft cunt. If you're going to waste it like that, you might as well leave it all to me. Now get the drinks in.
Can you not go yourself.
Four kilos. That's what -- Ten years' worth? Russian sailors? Mikey Forrester? What the fuck are you on these days? You've been to jail, Spud, so what's the deal -- like it so much you want to go back again?
For four fucking grand?  One palm tree, a couple of rocks, and a sewage outflow.
It's where I live.
Eh-
Shut up.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
Because it's illegal.
Easy for you to say.
Are you clean?
Too young for what?
Unless you get caught.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
What, and deny myself the only pleasure I get from him? Did I tell you about my birthday?
It'll be here somewhere. I might have returned it by mistake.
Oh, yes, indeed. I look back on my time there with great fondness and affection. The debating society, the first eleven, the soft know of willow on leather --
Oh, really?
Exactly. Those very words have been my guiding light in what is, after all, a dark and often hostile world.
You were referred here by the Department of Employment. There's no need for you to get you "foot in the door", as you put it.
It's no problem.
No problem.  No problem -- easy to say when its some other poor cunt with shite for blood.
Nightmare.
Lewis Gilbert.
But you're looking better, it has to be said. Healthier. Radiant even.
That's your theory?
It wasn't my baby. She wasn't my baby. Baby Dawn. She wasn't mine. Spud's? Swanney's? Sick Boy's? I don't know. Maybe Allison knew. Maybe not. I wished I could think of something to say, something sympathetic, something human.
And I got a stitch stuck between my teeth, jerked my head back and the whole fucking stump fell off.
Fuck you.
It was just an idea.
There's a mate of swanney's. Mikey Forrester -- you know the guy. He's come into some gear. A lot of gear.
Four Grand.
Well, it's up to you.
He knows a lot about Sean Connery.
To see you through the night that lies ahead.
Your favourite dish.
Stick it on my tab.
As you wish.
Yeah.
Such as?
I've got balls like watermelons, I'm telling you.
But where?
No, not homeless people. Beggars, Francis Begbie -- one of my mates. I wouldn't say my best mate, I mean, sometimes the boy goes over the score, like one time when we -- me and him -- were having a laugh and all of a sudden he's fucking gubbed me in the face, right --
It is I.  The journey you undertook to reach me could not have been an easy one.
And how did you breach the Barrier?
You doubt me?
Is there a problem, gentlemen?
Then it's fortunate that I have you and your starship to protect me. In the meantime, Captain Chekov, I instruct you and your First Officer to beam down to my coordinates.
Enterprise, this is Starfleet Operations. Come in.
With all due respect, the Enterprise is a disaster. There must be other ships in the quadrant.
The power was within you.
Join my quest.
What you seek. What all men have sought since time began - ultimate knowledge. But to find it we'll need a starship.
I think you gave me too much time, Captain.
Why didn't you beep my communicator?
Put it on the veiwscreen, would You please?
Put it on the screen.
Captain, we're receiving transmission from Paradise City. They're demanding to know our intentions.
Go, Sulu.
Goodnight, Doctor.
I cannot be certain.
Who is it he reminds you of?
Fascinating.
Yes, Captain?
Captain, what have I done -
If you think it would help.
If I had pulled the trigger, Sybok would be dead.
Technically, you are correct. I do not have a brother.
I have a half brother.
The designers tested it using the most intelligent and resourceful person they could find. He failed to escape.
"c."... "k."
Mark two. Request emergency assistance. Acknowledge.
I believe we are witnessing my birth.
I'll take you to the bridge.
I'm afraid of nothing.
Now learn something about yourself.
Am I? We'll see.



"Let's see what she's got," said the Captain. And then we found out, didn't we?
Uhura, I thought you were on leave.
It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
Do you?
No. You must save yourselves. Forgive me, brother. Forgive me.
You haven't told him?
I still don't get why you're trying to break into the system.
Yeah. Tryin' to find the file and erase it. Once that's gone, ain't nothin' can stop him. Just Eddie and his Master Control Program, runnin' things from on high..
Boy, if we were inside, I know how to forge us a Group 6 access...
Nah...I decided...I've had enough of video games to last me a good long time. I feel like gettin' into some real life...
Flynn had access to you, too. I'm not interested in talking about him.
You call that getting over it?
I'm certainly not.
Well, you have to expect some static. Computers are just machines after all, they can't think...
Alan. Alan Bailey.
oh, you have Group 7 access, don't you?
So... Nice ship you got here. What's our next move?
Now, wait a minute -- I wrote you.
I'm sorry, Walt. So much pressure lately... you feel like going for a drink?
I... have come to communicate with my User.
Hah.
Greetings, program...
How about you?
Oh, I was an actuarial program... worked at a big insurance company. It really gives you a great feeling, helping folks plan for their future needs -- and of course, if you look at the payments as an annuity, over the years, the cost is really
Yeah, but I'm remembering all kinds of stuff. Like...my User wants me to go after the MCP
We have to talk.
That's right. He pushed me...in the other world. Somebody pushes me, I push back. So I brought him down here ... What's the matter, Sark? You look nervous.
Now get this straight, pal -- no one User wrote me. I'm worth a couple million of their man-years! I'm bigger than all those little wimps put together!  Humans they can't even keen their social order in one piece
You rather take your chances with me? Want me to slow down your power cycles for you?
We'll get them, sir... These things take time.
We have to.
I have to find out what Alan wants... that comes first.
Oh, Tron... I knew you'd escape... they've never built circuit that could hold you...
Power surge... the transmission beam's too strong!
I'm shocked.
Just an hour?  You should tell this stud to take more time.
Out.  If Dad doesn't care enough about us to be here on his birthday, then why should I care? I'm going to a movie.
Great!  You're going to believe that fat dweeb Mr. Hardy over your own daughter.
Yeah, Dad.
Fine.
Honey that song came out in 1968, when I was exactly your age.
Alright, I want a complete workup on her.  Do we know where she is?
You're kidding.
Okay.  Let's step up the surveillance on her.  Put on two more guys.
And make it fast.  My horse is getting tired.
Hardcore, highly fanatical, ultra-				* fundamentalist.  Linked to					* numerous car-bombings, that cafe				* bomb in Rome, and the 727 out of Lisbon last year.  Major player.				*
You want me to just hang-- ?
I'll just hang then, shall I?
It can't be.
I still don't believe it.
Put a tap on her phone.
Helen's phone.  Her office line and the line at my house.
Sure, Harry.  I'm on it.
There is only one solution to your problem, Mrs. Tasker.  You must work for us.
Let's go.  I'll brief you in the air.
... the Coast Guard has to clear them back to a twenty mile radius.  Anybody that can't make the minimum safe distance we need an airlift on, immediately--
Sorry.
But he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right?  I mean--
Yes, sir.
That's right.  They want something...  dramatic.  I spoke to a number of people who said you're the one to see.
Those wimps.  It's because I use				* my diplomatic contacts to export cultural treasures from countries which tell them to take a hike.  I told you to move those crates an hour ago.  Come on guys, let's get going.
Yeah.  You should have seen it. We were the hit of the show with the new model ordering system, the one for the 680... how you can write up an order and the second the customer's name goes into the computer, it starts checking their credit, and if they've ordered anything in the past, and if they get a discount...
I slept with him and he knocked off a hundred bucks.
I'll handle it.
It's okay, don't bother, Harry.
I'll just be a second.  So what happened tonight at the office?
No.
Harry?  What can I say about Harry?  He's a sales rep for a computer company.
No.
No one must know!  Especially him.  You must appear to live your life normally, conveying nothing.  The security of this nation depends on it.  Can you do that?
The code name of your contact will be Boris.  Your code name will be--
What?  Oh, the flat tire?  Yeah, I thought the damn towtruck was never going to get there.
Sodium amytal, maybe some other truth agent.
What about Juno?
What?
No.  Much more.
Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay?
So what's your angle?
What about the husbands?
Some kinda legal secretary of something.  Married to some boring jerk.
Let me think about it.  Hold it a day for me?
You son of a bitch.  Did you really think you could elude us forever, Carlos?
Go ahead.
No, my dear, he is a federal agent.  He killed two of my colleagues the other night.
Samir is just going to ask Harry a few questions.  See, we're not even sure which agency Harry works for.  Now, Samir is absolutely first class, but on the other hand we have Harry, here, who has managed to lie convincingly to the woman he loves for 15 years.  So it will be interesting to see how long he can resist.
Something you obviously have a hard time doing!
It's strange.  I knew I was in a woman's thoughts when I was shooting it out with those assassins.
I just glances inside.
Find out who this Renquist it.
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
Knock wood.
The letter he sent.
Ya looked through it?
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
Is that your real name? Really?
I took a cab.
What time is it?
There's nothing to tell.
What do you do?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Five.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
What?
You will?
What?
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
What?
That rhymes.
Heard that.
You don't like it, but you eat that shit.  He eats it.
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Ask him if he got the letter.
You goin' out?
I certainly hope so.
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
Elliot Blitzer.
The zoo.  What are you waiting for?
Two guys.
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
I don't blame you.  So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
He trusts you?
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
Yeah?
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
I can see what you mean.
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Anything stronger?  Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
I got some money I can give you -
Sure.
McTeague.
I don't see why not. When you gonna come round and see my new place?
Step inside.
Absolutely.
Uh-huh.
I believe he believes him.
We talked him into it.
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
How the fuck could he know?
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
This guy's gonna kill him.
Look here. If I ever did eat some pussy - I would never eat any pussy - but, if I did eat some pussy, I sure as hell wouldn't tell no goddamn body. I'd be ashamed as a motherfucker.
Why you trippin'? We jus' fuckin' with ya. But I wanna ask you a question. You with some fine bitch, I mean a brick shithouse bitch - you're with Jayne Kennedy. You're with Jayne Kennedy and you say "Bitch, suck my dick!" and then Jayne Kennedy says, "First things first, nigger, I ain't suckin' shit till you bring your ass over here and lick my bush!" Now, what do you say?
No way, JosÈ.
Naw, they ain't stayin' here. But, I know who you're talkin' about. They're stayin' at the Hollywood Holiday Inn.
Uh, what?
For a man in your position...an opportunity.
This is it, James...what you've been working for.
Shut up!
Hey, no problem, it's probably just another kidnapping featuring Jeffrey's shrink, pardon me, make that ex-shrink.  This is your leader, a certifiable lunatic who told his former psychiatrist all his plans for God knows what whacko irresponsible schemes, and now who knows what she's painted out there on our wall?
It was released in Philadelphia, probably on June 14, 1995.
So that...???
I need to go now.
July?!
1995?
Perhaps it was a wrong number...
No more drugs.  Please...
Ohhhh, that one!  Can we hear that one?
We dream about what's important in our lives. And I seem to have become pretty important in yours.  What was the dream about?
And I was in it?  What did I do?
Nevermind.  It's not real -- it's a hoax.  A prank.  He's hiding in a barn. Hey, turn left here.  Left!
Jeffrey Mason?
You know Dr. Mason's son, Jeffrey Mason, don't you, James?  You met him in the County Hospital six years ago.
Jeffrey Mason said it was my idea about the virus.  And suddenly, I wasn't sure.  We talked when I was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. The drugs and stuff.  You think maybe I'm the one who wiped out the human race?  It was my idea?
James...do you remember...six years ago...you had a phone number!  You tried to call and...
They got your message, Kathryn.  They played it for me.  It was a bad recording...distorted.  I didn't recognize your voice.
If we can't change anything...because it's already happened, then we ought to at least smell the flowers.
No!  Look, I don't belong here!  What I need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.
Scientists.  I'm supposed to report in to them.  They'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.
What's that mean?
You do know me.  You helped me once.
How did you find me?
The call I just made?  Five minutes ago?
You're insane, Jeffrey.
Might be tight.
Twelve Monkeys, honey.  Guess you folks didn't turn on your radio this morning.
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun from your eyes.
That's 'cause he's dead.
Just 'cause I ain't got eyes doesn't mean I can't see.
Or maybe you just think you do.  You can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, there you are.
What do you want for free?
Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.
Well, a man with some gumption.  How much money you got?
Will be.
It will.
I . . . Mexico.  You got a bus that goes to Mexico?  That's where I have to go.
How much.
One way.
I'm sorry, sir.  It's thirty dollars for the ticket.
You Harlin?
'Cause Harlin used to own it.
Look, pal, I've got places to be. Could you just take a look at my radiator hose.  It's busted.
I know it's busted.  What did I just tell you?
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Twenty-after-ten.
Don't look like nothing.
That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.
Then you ain't gonna have the car.
That's a good piece of advice, Darrell.
What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight.  Maybe two.
There you go, sweet talking me again.
It is morning.
Honest like Al Capone on tax day. Where are my keys?
You know how that Toby is.  Thinks every man he sees is after his Jenny.
They look nice.
I'm just going to my car.
You sure you can manage?
Yeah, my luck.  I get to be stuck out here in this hole in the desert.
I guess I've got wander in my blood.
If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Maybe I like to find out about a man first.  Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Depends on what you call love.  When I was growing up I had nothing.  I learned to want everything.  I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket.  He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together.  I courted him.  I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line.  I wanted him.  I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him.  Is that love?
From?
I . . . nothing.  Just something he said.  So if the money's in a safe we'd have to get the combination--
If the key's on him, to get the key we'd have to . . .
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Because I know you're full of shit.
I don't know.
I . . . nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell . . . that's all.
Yeah.  Good thinking.
Funny thing.
Grace!  Just . . . let me handle this.  Sheriff, I'm telling you there's nothing in that trunk.  If that's not good enough for you, then I'd be happy to open it.  Just as soon as you get yourself a search warrant.
Thirty-thousand, that's all.  We would have been free and clear.  You didn't have to kill him.
But I want to say with you,
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you.  Don't you think I care about you?
Grace!
You closed it, didn't you, Grace?
Walk to where?  We're fifty miles to the nearest town.  It's going to be over one-hundred degrees today.  How far do you think you're going to get?
I'm her husband.
Yeah, I know.  More careful.
Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat.  Wants me to sail it for him.
How do you know if you've never tried?
Just ran into a little trouble.
No.
No.
I was hoping we could talk.
That was just loose talk.  I don't want anybody dead.
This morning I didn't know how badly I'd want to get out of this fucking town.
For that I'd kill a nun on Easter Sunday.
I'm not your boy, Jake.  I don't like you, and I don't like what you are.  I got no choice but to do business with you.  This is just a nasty little marriage of convenience.
And tell her what?
I know all right.  I know you're just enough of a shit to have a go at bedding a man's wife.  You've probably bagged a few at that. You'd probably lie, cheat and steal without thinking twice.  From that you'd just turn and walk away.  But to kill; to get that blood on your hands.  You can't wash that off. You'd be a marked man for life. Just like Cain.  And you're a sinner who wants to walk with the saints. Ain't that right, boy?
Came close this time and it scares you.
All I have in the world.
There's another reason?  It better be good.
You came to take my wife from me?
Liar.
Christ, Jake, please--
What are you . . . you can't . . . you can't kill me.
Think about it.  How do you think I got in here?  Did you hear any glass break?  Did you hear a door splinter?  How did the evening end? After you went to bed did she linger a bit?  Maybe just long enough to leave the back door unlocked?  Is that what happened?
What?
That country shit all sounds the same to me.
I've had time to get over it.
Oz.
I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.
Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town.
What the hell are you talking about?
Will you shut up!
You know who I am?  Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
'Cause I'm just like dynamite.  And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl.  Would you please tell him?
You stupid punk!  You don't even know what you're fighting over!
I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket!
With a shotgun.  It kills him, and it shreads the money.  I mean, what are the odds?
Yes, Mr. Vesci.
Maybe not for you, Sheriff, but I think I've had my fill of your little town.
Shut up!  The both of you.  Ain't neither one of you too smart. Especially you, boy.  Don't you think I had my eye on you since first you rolled into town?  You smell like trouble.  Stink of it like a ripe cesspool.
Eh?
But, Senor--
You want something?
You can't do that yourself?
I'm sorry, I didn't--
I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes.
All right, old man.  Christ.
I hope you wasn't pettin' him none, was you?
He's only just dead.  What was I supposed to do with him?  I can't take him away anywhere.  And nobody wants to take him for me.  Do you?
So now you're going to tell me where I lost my eyes. You don't think I know where I lost my eyes? I was there when I lost them. I lost them in the war. The war in the joint. There's always wars in the joint. Cause I was a code talker in the joint and in the war too. Mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. Be careful, boy.
So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it?
Oh, shit!
I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him?
Give it to me!
Who the hell are you?
You broke my nose!
Bobby Cooper.
That's the sweat of a man who hasn't an honest bone in his body.  Don't be offended, lad.  A man who's got no ethics is a free man.  I envy that.  Beside, how can I blame you?  That Grace sure has a mind of her own, and a body to match, don't she?  Eh?
Can't live with them, and you can't shoot 'em.
How do you know if you've never tried?
I did?
Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on.
Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead.
A man doesn't always mean the things he says.
What makes you say that?
And what does that make you?
You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know.
No!
Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money.
What are you talking about!
Two-hundred dollars...I'll do it!  I'll kill her!
You're too quick for me.
Somewhere else?  Mister, somewhere else is fifty miles from here. Only other gas station down in town closed 3 years ago when the mine got shut...
Yeah, I can fix it.
You got to be more careful. Hands is important.  Let me show you something. When I was a kid, now I don't know if you can still see it, but I gashed my fingers in a lawnmower.
Diner up a piece.  Not much, but us simple folk like it.
Don't look like nothing.
Another accident?  You got to be more careful.
About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone.
Yeah, well, I've been around the bend a bit.
You believe that?
You said this morning the hose was going to run me one-fifty.
What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick.
Eh?
No trouble at all, really.
Oh, this isn't my car.  It's down a ways. I should have parked closer.  I just didn't think it would be so heavy.  I could drive up.
I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there.
Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... .
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman.
Really?  And what game did you want to play?  You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
No.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I'm still here, aren't I?  See this?
Walk away.
If the key's on him, how do we get the key?
After dark.  I'll leave the back door unlocked.
He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ...
Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past...
But we all need that too. Hold him.
Son.  Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup.
Harlin's.
And that's not the half of it, Mr. Arkadin...
How much?
The ticket is 30.55.
Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing.
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things...
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing.  We was just talking.
Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here?
Yes.
Four.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
He's asleep.
I haven't been sick this year. I know that.
That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means?
No that's it.
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
Jesus.
Think carefully?
Seventy-five percent.
In college. A car accident.
Is there a problem?
Yes he is.
I want to sleep here tonight.
I won't make any noise.
How much can you lift?
That's great.
Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York.
Fine.
How long have you been married?
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
Where is it?
What did you think, they come clear up from Kansas to fuck us?
Don't matter. They burned the table in '78 for firewood.
Nope.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
Three days. Are you hungry?
Yeah, I guess.  There's still a payment, ain't there?
Shit and fried eggs.
I heard that one myself, Bob. Hell, I even thought I was dead til I found out it was just I was in Nebraska.  Who's your friend?
No?
You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
Yup.
I didn't hear nothin' till last night.
You know how women kin lie... I knock 'em around a little, ask 'em where the money is, they say they don't have none?... but they coulda squirreled away that much, the five of 'em. Maybe. 
What's your name?
"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
Duck, I says.  "You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns." 
He will be hurryin' and he will miss. That there is as fast as I can pull an' aim an' hit anythin' more'n ten feet away... unless it's a barn.
Is... is it... loaded?
Did you... kill him?
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
No he ain't. He went South yesterday.
Nobody didn't kill Ned, he went South yesterday. He didn't even kill nobody. Why would anybody kill Ned?
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died.  Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
About where you an' him  was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
On account of my Schofield model Smith and Wesson pistol.
Well, how about it?
Wasn't nothin' said about no partner.
I was gonna kill them two by myself. It don't take three.
Lookin' at?
He ain't dead? You didn't get him?
You missed him? You didn't...?
You ain't shot.
Huh?
Two weeks, I guess.
How far kin you see?
Not for me. I don't touch it no more.
What he was talkin' about... how them deputies had the drop on you an' Pete...
You still think it'll be easy shootin' them cowboys?
We got to kill this other one first.  Shit, Ned, if we're lucky, we could kill him by nightfall... or maybe tomorrow morning. Then we could head back, all three of us, with the money.
He's blind, for Chri...
Yeah.
How many you killed, Kid?
We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
Maybe.
We'll bury him.
Yeah?
They tell me you got the cripple from New York in there. He mention Keyser Soze
Bear with me here...
And ?
&lt;&lt;I'll tell you everything. I'11 even say it slow enough for you to understand it. Just tell this man I want protection. Real protection.&gt;&gt;
They'll never stop.
Alright.
This whole thing was a shakedown.
Then who goes?
The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
What do you care what he says?
I walked. Ninety days, suspended.
Verb - Roger, this is Edie Finneran. Edie, this is Roger Kint, he was at
McManus has a friend in the Fourteenth Precinct. They're coming out for one job - Thursday. They're picking up a guy smuggling emeralds out of South America. Fenster and McManus have a fence set to take the stuff.
You okay?
Well, I'm sorry.
Not if we do it my way.
Something - I don't know.  I ever tell you about the restaurant I wanted to open?
Who's Keyser Soze?
Don't jerk me off. We all know what this is. You don't work with me if I work with you without knowing who I'm working for. Now let's cut the shit. Who's the man?
You're lying.
The D.A. came down here last night ready to arraign before they even moved him to county. Kint's lawyer comes in and five minutes later, the D.A. comes out looking like he'd been bitch-slapped by the boogey man. They took his statement and cut him a deal.
Someplace else, then.
If it was a dope deal, where's the dope, if it was a hit, who called it in?
I don't think he does. Not exactly, but there's a lot more to his story. I want to know why twenty-seven men died on that pier for what looks to be ninety-one million dollars worth of dope that wasn't there. Above all, I want to be sure that Dean Keaton is dead.
I told the D.A. everything I know.
Keaton was a piece of shit.
What lawyer?
Turn state's evidence. Take the stand on this and we'll hear it out.
This is totally irrelevant.
Give a guy a break, huh?
McManus was furious. He was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. That night we got the call.
Kobayashi told us where we could find Fenster.
But Keaton...
Because he was my friend.
THE KIND OF MAN THAT COULD HAVE KILLED EDIE FINNERAN.
The district attorney's office will comply provided -
Then prosecute. I will be very impressed to see if the District Attorney manages to bring in twenty-seven simultaneous counts of murder against one man with cerebral palsy. I would think a man with your job would agree with these alleged &quot;faceless people in City Hall&quot; you mention.
Nothing.
Accused.  Not indicted.  He resigned the firm.  Divorced nineteen seventy.  Galvin worked with Michael Morrissey until Morrissey retired in 'seventy-eight.  Since then he's been on his own.  Four cases before the Circuit Court.  He lost them all.  He drinks.
... yes.  Get her on the phone ...
... a Mrs. Doneghy called ... I told you that.
I was her doctor.
...I was one of a group of...
Why wasn't she getting oxygen...?
Just as you are, Sir...
Sir.  Yes.  When a thing is wrong...as in this case, I am available.  I am seventy-four years old, I am not board-certified.  I have been practicing medicine for forty-six years and I know when an injustice has been done.
Nothing further, your Honor.
You may step down.
...one moment, Mr. Concannon...
Thank you, your Honor.  Further: Ms. Costello is a rebuttal witness. As a `Surprise Witness' she may only serve to rebut direct testimony.  As her only evidentiary rebuttal was the admitting form, which has been disallowed I request that her entire testimony be disallowed and the jury advised that they must totally disregard her appearance here.
I...
You've just said you signed it.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in.  He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form.    And he told me to change the form.  He told me to change the one to a nine.   Or else, or else, he said...  He said he'd fire me.  He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...?  I wanted to be  a nurse...
Hold on a second.
Easthampton Hospital for Women. Excuse me, what is that, a joke? Let me tell you something, Doctor, those men at Catherine Laboure. Men who are known not only in this city, but the world, were trying to save a woman's life.  They were there, and here you are, four years later, read some hospital report, and say...
The Doctors were not negligent.
From what I've seen, Mr. Galvin, you have a very good case...
Cardiac arrest.  During delivery her heart stopped.  When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen.  You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
It's my opinion it took him much longer.  Nine...ten minutes. There's too much brain damage.
Yes.
You're going to settle out of court?
Why?
Her doctors killed her.
I understand.
Who says that I'm protecting anyone?
Why is that?
I wasn't disbarred, they dropped the pro...
That happens.
I don't have a week.  This case never should have come to trial. You know better.  You're Mr. Independent.  You want to be independent?  Be independent now. I've got no sympathy for you.
Thank you, your Honor, I'll continue.  Dr. Thompson.  Did you examine Deborah Ann Kaye last night at The Northern Chronic Care Facility?
What?
If I may be permitted to question my own witness in my own way...
No, no, you listen to me.  All I wanted in this case is an even shake.  You rushed me into court in five days...my star witness disappears, I can't get a continuance, and I don't give a damn.  I'm going up there and I'm going to try it.  Let the Jury decide.  They told me Sweeney he's a hard-ass, he's a defendant's judge.  I don't care.  I said, the hell with it.  The hell with it. I'll take my chances he'll be fair.
Let me talk to Mickey.
Kathy Price.
Yes.  It was, actually.
And are they going to get it?
I've got to work.
Who told you that?
Is there going to be a later...?
If I don't 'grow up...'
He's...you can't reach him, Sir. He's in the, on some island in the Caribbean, they don't have a phone.   He'll be back in a week...  If you'd like Dr. Halpern's number...
What do you want?
Forget it.  You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash.
...Gruber's not bad.GALVIN Not bad...?  This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick...  And you calm down, all right?  Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book,  'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.'  ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse...'All these guys are God.  I saw them walk on water...'
Right.
Right.
So what...?  The best is yet to come.  Check the TV Guide.  They got our Dr. Towler on a panel on GBH on Friday: 'The Healing Hand. The Experts Speak.'
So what do you want me to do? Concannon's going to try the case his way, I'm going to try it mine. You want me to go wee wee wee all the time because he's got some flack, got stories in the newspaper. I'm going to win this case.
I think we tried that.  The case is over.
All right.  Who wasn't in the O.R.?
Hello.  This is Mr. Dorchester in Records.  We're looking for Kathy Costello...
But what can we do?  She don't know who's visiting her ...
My doctor told me that I got to move out West ... that's when we filed in court.  We didn't want to sue ...
We, yes.  Yes.  They, they present their side, and I get the same chance.  To cross-examine... to... to...
In New York?
You're really...  You, are you the one they told me was the nurse?
Mrs...
Yes...
Yes.
Yes.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Yes, that's correct.
Yes, the roving nurse...
We had rather more important things on our mind than taking notes.   We were trying to restore her...
Yes.
I married into it.
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
That's Carlotta Valdes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Scottie, what happened? She's not home, yet.
Do you live here in the hotel?
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Your name. And --
No, you don't owe me anything.
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
No, Ernie's is fine.
To complete my cure.
No! Let me go!
Your accident...
I don't know... Switzerland?
I loved you, Madeleine.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
Where had you been before?
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Some people prefer it.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
You've nothing to apologize for.
I enjoyed talking to you.
What?
Good-bye.
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
I don't like them.
Knowing I have to die...
Only silence. It's always like this.
Here with you.
No!
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
A grave...
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I'm here, I've got you...
No, never!
And it's a all real.
Please let me go.
I won't lose you.
Why?
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
Johnny, the doctors explained --
It's where you belong.
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
I've never run across one like that.
Who?
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Do you know him well?
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Bye-bye!
Oh?
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Oh... this and that.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
How?
Excellent.
I need a drink.
We're gonna get caught. I know we're gonna get caught. They were eyeballing my car.
What?
First of all...
Because my opinion threatens yours, it's poorly developed?
Franco mother-fucking Harris!
Why was the floor wet?
Don't you fucking threaten me - I'll fucking kill you.
Over eight years of some of the hardest raging experiences of my life.
Nobody knows she's here. I called her personally. Nobody knows.
You don't think someone will have a problem with a body being thrown off a balcony?
Watch the tone fella.
Any time fat boy!
They're on me. They're smoking me out!
It has worked.
Later.
I know you'll be.  Three hours.
Don't eyeball your kids.
Jesus Adam, can we not get into this now please?
Micheal. Tell Lois that nothing...
The groom?
I'm just gonna let her know I'm here.
Or a stock kick of approximately 125% on shares which are currently sitting around $4.38, or, in plain English...
Well we can definitely call the police. That's an easy call. If we call the police...What happens?  They find a dead prostitute in the bathroom...They ask us...What happened? We say, ah...our friend, Micheal...  Your brother...got a little out of control...they were making love...and he got a little excited...and he, ah, sort of beat her head into the side of a toilet, while he choked her to death with a rubber hose...
You always were a jealous man.
What did you ask me?
Does she sound pissed, scared, hostile? Did she mention the police?
Yeah.
Now?
You've got a warped thought process. Your brain doesn't function properly.
Fine? Fine what?
You said one in two marriages end in divorce.
Oh really? Starbucks?
And what happens when you can't?
Israel doesn't have a King.
What's your point?
The Israelis can protect themselves. They got the Mossad thing happening. Mossad's for real, man. They scalp babies.
They need leadership.
You said nobody would miss her.
You will not screw this up.
Micheal get a grip.  What did you tell her?
We missed the deadline.
Sent it.
You know how important this is to my mother. You know that.
I'm just saying I bet those checks all found the mailboxes.
It amazes me how organized you and your little fun bunch can be when it comes time to mobilize to Vegas.
David Boyd is a big sack of hot gas.
Who else?
I've seen it on television.
I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask?  Is that to much to ask!?!
So what do we do?
Go down where?
We're leaving from Adam's. Come send me off.
I will.
Hi.
Okay.
No. No. I'll see you in about four hours.
I'm working on it.
Yeah. You.
No it's not okay. It's not.
Oh God. We. Liz. We. We. Killed a woman. We...
Oh Liz. We. God. We, in Vegas. Micheal crushed her skull. She was dead. There was nothing else to do. It was an accident.
The prostitute.
It's too late.
She's in the desert. She's out in the desert.
The only proof is those bodies.
You never walked away dad. You could have walked away.
I just want her to be happy.
You're not breathing right?
At the newsstand on 3rd.
The wahoo?
No. No. No. This is my doing. You see I'm gonna have my wahoo spark for my own. For Lois and the kids, for my brother, for Franco. I'm gonna turn myself in. I am all that. I'm gonna do it for sweet Lois.
How do you know she's dead.
Did she believe you?
Yup.
What song?
Fish, I'm really sorry. I just...I owe you man.  Desert.
I KILLED MY BROTHER!
Smoking makes me feel ill? It's these filthy fag ends. I won't mention in this company what's upsetting you.
What about them?
That one.
Really, Don AMALIO, there's not much point in making a fuss.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
In twenty years the grass has invaded everything. There are spiders all over the house except on the first floor. I hardly ever go out.
You are spoiling me too much. I won't know what to do with myself when you've gone.
Evil.
Today I can refuse you nothing.
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
I have asked her but she's ungrateful. Sometimes I feel like hitting her. When I talk to her about the convent, she turns to stone.
Speak to her again. Explain everything to her seriously.
It's only that ... It's all very odd, sir.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Why do you say that? Perhaps the young girl is a bit jealous.
Run and get something to mop it up with, quickly.
I think I'd better go tomorrow.
There's plenty of money in this house. Piles of it.
Where's the dough?
Why did he kill himself?
That's stupid! Plaster! It can still be used.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
Parents? Nobody cares a damn, what's the use of them!
He couldn't get through the door, then?
Yes!
I've discovered something about Lindenmeyer'5 Maestro teaching tool I thought you should know...  The harm done to the music students who used the device —— it was not by accident. The machine was designed explicitly for that purpose. Lindenmeyer intended to hurt the kids using it.
Madison lives two blocks from their present location.
I don't know.
Why'd.. .you pull me out?
Real, my ass. It's an overblown game.  Anybody ever catch that fucking psycho?
Parker Barnes, I'd like you to meet Crime Czar Elizabeth Deane.
If you can catch him.
You son—of—a—bitch. How could you let them put the implant in my head? How?
I think we both know who did.  What's so urgent?
We have an emergency situation which requires somebody with expertise in criminal psychology. Under the authority vested in me by the President, I'm giving you temporary re—assignment.
You're going to put your theories to practice. I'm sending you into the field.
I was assured the problem was corrected.
Neither will the public.  The media has caught wind of his pardon. Unless Mr. Barnes starts giving me some tangible results, I'm going to put him back in his cage.
This is supposed to be years away.
Show me his physical sensory level.
Then fix it.
True genius is rarely rewarded within its lifetime.
It was me, what?
What was going through your mind when you killed the busboy?
I don't have to do anything except survive. And it's taking everything I've got just to do that.
Fine. Never felt better in my life.  See, I'm a good liar.
Charlie? You say that like you're close, personal friends.
Maybe after they catch him, you should write a book about him...
Just like they figured there was no better person to catch one...
How did you get your hand out?
I prefer keeping my professional life separate from my personal life.
Thank-you.  Her name is Karin.
I told you, it was on the way and I wanted to change clothes.
I ruin so many moments by analyzing them when I should just be living them.
Enjoying yourself?
I'm doing the best I can!
Start of what?
You like baseball?
I told you before, Grimes liked to be obvious.
Thanks.
A bomb's going off tomorrow night, but I have no idea where.
Because this pain—in—the—ass criminal psychology expert has helped me understand what I'm capable of. And what I'm not.  And better than anyone else, I am capable of stopping Sid 6.7.
Performing solo.  Enjoying the concert so far?
You are going after Mayor Bennett.
As long as you keep overpaying me, I'll be the first to go into production on three, and four, as well.
At this stage, you either get form or function. You said she wanted function. I gave you function. What are you complaining about?
<u>Lure</u> him. 
Okay.  Okay.  The <u>Suitcase</u> Bomb...
I don't think you're gonna need it.
I need a little bit of <u>help</u>...?
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
Hi, How are ya?  <u>Listen</u> to this, willya...
...twelve years.
You know, I think you people are looking at this All Wrong.  If you look at the <u>backstory</u> -- the guy's coming back from Combat and Torture.  Of <u>course</u> he is gonna be ... uh ... uh ... "fucked up".  Of <u>Course</u> he's gonna "need a little help"... 
Shot down, Forced down...  You guys are <u>missing</u> it... You're missing the <u>opportunity</u>
...how do we explain that?  With the World Watching.
What rig?
Okay.  And she's alleging...?
What in the <u>world</u> would do that?
I'll see you at National.
The American "people"?
Why <u>not</u>, what've they ever done for <u>us</u>...?  Also:  they sound... Ah, you see, this is why we have to mobilize the B-2 <u>Bomber</u>...
Well, I'm gonna hold on, but you went to win this election, you better change the subject.  You wanna change this subject, you better have a War.  What do you need?  It's gotta be <u>quick</u>, it's gotta be <u>dramatic</u>, you got to have an <u>enemy</u>.  Okay?  What do you need in an enemy?  Somebody you fear.  Who do you fear? Som'b'y you don't know.
Why?
It's like that thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Eight Days To Go 
Anything at the Airport?
...this's <u>good</u>...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
<u>I</u> dunno.... Ambassador to <u>Togo</u>, somethin', <u>I</u> dunno... he...
I'm doing my job, Too.  Would you give me a... do you think you could call off your Dogs for a minute.
Gloria -- sell the House.  
Well, what do you want to do about it?  What do you...
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
ON THE MEN, IN THE ROOM, ARGUING ABOUT THE ILLEGAL ALIEN, SCHUMANN IN THE B.G.
How's our friend?  What is he, "dead?"
Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to...
Well, I'm not interested in how long its "got to hold for."
Then show a little spunk.  There <u>Is</u> no B-2 Bomber, General Scott, the best of your knowledge, is not in Seattle to talk with Boeing...
When's he coming back...?
And, to hold it together, I need two days.  There <u>is</u> no B-2 Bomber:  here's what you do ahout that:  whoever is leaking stuff to that geek at the Post, lets it slip, "Geez, I hope this doesn't screw up the B-2 Program..." "What B-2 Program, and why should it screw it up?"  "If the president moves to deploy the B-2 before it is fully tested."  "Deploy the B-2, <u>Why</u>?"  "In the Crisis."
We have some mutual friends in Washington.
Uh, <u>nothing</u>, oh, <u>nothing</u> ... uh... a <u>War</u>, uh...  You're kidding.
Uh, it's a slogan.  From, uh...
Why Albania?
The... 
Is that true?
...going to War...
It's Miss America, N'you're Bert Parks. 
I'm sure they do.
...it's a Teaser!
No, King, I need you here <u>yesterday</u>...  How long do I need him for?
President's speech.
No, no, no, no, no <u>after</u> the airport.
The War is Over.  Senator Nole just ended the War.
...we put your Guy in a <u>sweater</u>...
"Good Old Shoe -- "  We put him in a sweater.
Did we ever use those costumes for the Border Patrol? Those guys in the Leopard-Skin <u>Hats</u>?  Here's my idea....
It's not too <u>clean</u>...
In the Folk Music Section.  We'll be in in...
Some, military... Special Program, Oklahoma somewhere...
Oh, you're gonna love this:
Get it in the stacks at the Library of Congress, Now.  Who's seeing the guy at C.B.S.?
You do your job right, nobody should notice.
...we'll gettim in their cars.
Ain't <u>that</u> the truth. 
Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a <u>Kingdom</u> was lost...
Yeah, well, perhaps...  Speaking of which:  I have a <u>prescription</u> here, I'm going to give you the <u>number</u>, I need you standing by with a <u>crate</u> of the stuff.... it's ... what is it?
Why not?
"...unsure whether or not Enemy Action..."
They'll be here in ten minutes.
...one more day.
Take ten.
Keep Talking....
Where are we on the Image?  Grace?  <u>Grace</u>...
Why are they ...
Military Special Programs... <u>Programs</u>... No, I am not Shouting at you, I'm... I'm sorry.  Anyone named <u>Shoe</u> Schumann?  <u>Schuster</u>... uh
Leopard Skin...
It's a <u>beret</u>...
...one minute:  Demille needs an elephant for a reshoot.
And what?  What?  She was Driven From Her Home, by Albanian Terrorists.  It is her we are mobilizing to defend... it is "she"?
I believe in you....
John Belushi... <u>Jim</u> Belushi...
Well, you  said it yourself, earlier, and if I may rephrase, that the success of the President, in the Polls...
...they... <u>you</u> know...
Come on, you fucking sissy, you think this is tough? Try show-business.  1970-1990, n'ybody I worked with, y'could of bottled their piss n'sold it in the <u>ghettos</u>...  Come on, Pal...
...'bout ready to Mix it Up...?
How 'bout a Cold Drink...?
They don't know what's going on!
Sounds like a french word, what is it?
Give me that phone.  Yes, sir, this is the manager. What seems to be the problem?
...still looking for the right 18 year old wife, how you doing, pal?
...sounds dubious Chuck, but Piping Rock any day.
Anacott Steel. Buy it.
Then get out and close it behind you.
Now! Tell everyone to dump!
Coulda been a contender.
Look Dad, I'm not a salesman. How many times I gotta tell you I'm an account executive, and pretty soon I'm going to the investment banking side of the firm.
Dad, it takes time. You gotta build a customer list. I'm doing it. I could make more money in one year as a broker than five years at the airline.
Can you spare three hundred? Pay you back next month, promise.
...Work okay?
Client. Got a private jet over at Butler Aviation... Dad, you always gotta light up when you see me, it's the...
... Dad, you should've been a CEO. How about dinner?
I met them before you were born.
Maybe that's the price, Bud, maybe so. It's gonna be rough on you but maybe in some screwed up way, that's the best thing that can happen to you...stop trading for the quick buck and go produce something with your life, create, don't live off the buying and selling of others...
Tell 'em your father gave it to you.
We are?
Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?
I just want to let you know Mr. Gekko I read all about you at NYU Business, and I think you're an incredible genius and I've always dreamed of only one thing -- to do business with a man like you...
Jackson, Steinem...
Can't tell you that, Mr. Gekko.
There was a crash last year. They just got a favorable ruling on a lawsuit. Even the plaintiffs don't know.
Bud Fox, I look at a hundred ideas a day. I choose one.
...I can't even see it...
...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. I want to see what you know before I invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.
What? How do you know about my father?
'Course. Larry Wildman. One of the first raiders.
I don't understand.
...we have 37.2 million invested. At this point, we're up 3.1 million and some change. If it goes to 75 bucks we can clean close to 12 mill.
But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72.
I'm talking to a stockbroker who wants to run an airline. It's gonna take me two years and 2000 headaches to turn Teldar Paper around, what do I need this dink airline for? I'm up to my ass in more nuts than a fruitcake.
Alright... Susan, get Buckingham on the box. I want him to look at it. And tell Jock Taylor at Thwick, Jensen...  So sport, the falcon has heard the falconer...tell me more...
I found out about the garage sale down at Bluestar. Why?
Gordon.
Boy, I thought Gordon was a tough businessman, but somebody's really taking him to the cleaners here.
I gather you're a decorator.
And what do you want?
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
Great Carolyn, doing any better would be a sin...
...Janet get my father on the phone and the two other union reps, urgent...
No such thing Bud - 'cept death and taxes. Not a good company anymore, no fundamentals. What's going on Bud? Do you know something?  Remember there're no short cuts son, quick buck artists come and go with every bull market but the steady players make it through the bear markets.  You're part of something here, Bud. The money you make for people creates science and research jobs. Don't sell that out.
It's over you, Gordon.
Now tell me, why would I want to do that?
You got it, G.G.
We'll take our chances.  Nice to see you again, Mr. Gekko.
Oh I don't give a shit the guy's a slob.  He doesn't even know how to spell  `lady' let alone treat me like one.  You know the last time we went out he  actually made me pay for a drink?
Yes, I'm sure.  What I need is an older man, something with class, a  little style. Someone who knows how to treat a lady.
A body.  I mean we're talking major body
It's eleven forty-five let's go
Right. CHINA I need a taking care of,  not `hey how bout a pizza after class babe'.  I'm looking  for something just a little more in a man.  A little `je nes se qua'.
Thank you Jenkins
A party at a waxwork huh?
I'm not kidding.  I want to get out of here - now, ok.
That's not what you said last night.
Who's is all this?
Forget her Mark, she's a bitch
So Mark, what's so urgent?
Sell my soul?
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
I know he does.
Do you have any idea who she is?
Nope.
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
You were in an accident?
Just fine.  It's a lovely party.
Almost.
I know how hard it can be sometimes.
Ohhh yes.  No, no.  Just a little, you know...We're fine.
I have to go.
I've never even met you.
What?
I don't know.
I should be going anyway.
This is...
Anyway, Claire slept with him...
She's making this up.
Yep.
Listen, I've gotta run.  I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
...no...no...no...
The planchette?
Did I?
No.  Jody, listen to me.  You have to listen to me.  This is not something that I can do right now.  Whatever it was, it's gone.  I need it to be gone now.
Artsy little village down seven.  There's a guy there who sells my work.  I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
What are you going to do?
I know.
Don't.
Yep.
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
We did.
Nope.
Tomorrow.
To make sure she's all right.
But what if something happens?
There were some noises.  I didn't want to disturb you.
Really?
Well, that's nice.
What?
And that means he murdered his wife? This is getting ridic--
What do you mean?  Claire, we talked about it.  You didn't want Japanese, I said, Our first date since...
Restaurant.  Let them know we're running late.
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
Jody and I.  And she was there, Norman, she was.  It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Ever since the accident I've been worried that you'd been unhappy, or...
Claire, please...
I...
But why?  I can't understand how I could just completely--
Stop...
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Who?
...Oh BULLSHIT.  You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
How did she know where it was?
Yep.  There's some great places nearby.
What?
:Well, they are.
But it doesn't make sense.  They - they used Lasher...  they conspired with him.
Come.  There is a lot to read
Then you wear it.
When did she die...?
Yes.    Listen carefully, Rowan. Have your attorney contact me at once. There are matters of immediate -
I under5tand.  All the same
Better than most, I suppose.
It wes a dream...!
You - are - a - murderer.
Michael...  Help us...  The door!
Now, lasher - it is our time.
Anybody got a BP yet...?
FAST.
Always loved you..
I bring her flowers too.
It's very dangerous to assume you know what a woman wants.
What Michael gives me is stronger than anything you could ever inderstand.
I LOVE him!
Focus all your powers on me, Rowan until it is done. Only me...
Change me, Rowan, and we can change everything...
Wrong...?  Science is not magic.
Tell me what I am, Rowan.
It was an accident.   Gifford, too.
No!   Don't!  Lasher!!!
'Freak at the week.'   That's what the TV crew. call it-  people come right to the house.  They have a husband or wife who skipped town - or a missing kid-  They bring a sweater or a toy - and ask me to touch it. so I can teel them where they are..
You're not gonna give me the textbook analysia, are you doctor...? My vision was just the chemical reaction of an oxygen-starved brain - and nobody -
Like this...?  LIKE THIS...?!
You still feel that crazy...?
Let's see...  Next you tell me all the terrible things about you - and prove that we're doomed to fail - right...?   you hate kittens and puppies, you've drivin all your lovers to suicide --and those mysterious deaths at the hospital were really -
Listen.  Last night - oh Christ, this'1l take forever to explain. God, Michael...
Hello..
Than letts get rnarried, Michael.  I could put a spell on you - and make you say yes.
Hey - I'm getting married in the morning - I already gave up drinking. one crutch at a time, Doctor.
Go ahead.
Bullshit!  Let me in!   Mikey - there are people who can help figure this ont.
If you like that type.
Just don't fall off any ladders.
Sut McKinley.  Marry me.
You really love this guy...?
Is that a crack about our singing...?
Papers...?
The one on the left - definitely...
Yes it is...
Then we would have to call in our locksmith to break the lock
I didn't say that - I'm sure it could be, but our clients must sign in first, checking signatures, and a photo ident - we had a nasty theft two years ago and we've been very strict since then.
No -it's no problem - I do it all the time
Yes - I have had it for years.
Sure...
my car  I stopped working from my car.  She could have stopped me you know - If she really wanted too. That is the difference between the confusion of humanity and the purity of the beast - If a dog attacked you - you could easily kill it without any damage to yourself - Why then do people get bitten by dogs - savaged? Why?
You know everyone accuses me of being sick - the press, the TV - but I'm not you know - they are - I don't watch it for entertainment every night - I don't sit and watch it whilst eating my dinner - they all say, how could he cut her up? She was dead - I can't hurt something dead - And all this whilst they slobber down their processed beef burgers by the dozen - I couldn't eat one of those burgers, you don't know what has gone in them! 
I have something I have to show you...
It seemed like a good idea at the time - why did you marry your husband.
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
Did you?
STEPHANIE?
I know this sounds insane ELLEN, but... Telling you all of this, writing the book... It feels good. Don't get me wrong - I feel like a weight is being lifted from my shoulders... When I tell you what I have done - I can't believe it is me...Yet I know it was. This is like a purging for me...
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
No thanks - 
Why whats wrong with the sugar -
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
Yes I can...
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
Get out...
I'd really like it if you would come round some time - Then I could cook you a meal - what do you say...
Poor Freud, turning in his grave.
Cut it out, before you break something!
I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know...
Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies.
It better not be my Aunt Trudy.
We wanted to challenge the notions of classic beauty. We wanted to showcase women throughout the world.
This is a fun place...but we don't usually come here until after the orgies.
Oh, god.  Look. Look.
These are real, live women?
He kicked major ass and you know it.
From your lips, to God's ears.
Yeah?
Yeah?
SHUT UP!  Are you serious? Of course I will...of course.
So you'll think about it?
So that's a maybe?
I do? I mean, yeah, I do.
Come on, I was hamburger. You were porterhouse.
Then you better get in the water, before you get burned.
We own a small family grocery store.
We miss you. We miss our son.
Dad, please.
Remember how you struggled through that whole facts of life talk and then found out I knew more than you?
Well, why should I?
Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks?
I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face.
Just say it, Dad.
Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives.
Shopping, really? I should tell my friend.
Hi ho, Silver.
I always knew there was more. I felt it.
Whatever you want.
What do you want me to do?
I understand.
But how can you respect yourself if you don't?
I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers?
She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother.
You can have it, then. I'm not going back there.
Funny you should say that. My Grandfather was a peach farmer.
I didn't forget.
From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big.
But you triple-dog-dared me.
Your article sucked.
In the sense that there is no "hidden agenda" behind a bake sale that raised five hundred dollars for seeing eye dogs.
That's not ENTIRELY true.
Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew?
I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist.
You never know around here.
I did my homework. Your grandfather was a peach farmer.
I bet there are lots and lots of mirrors on Planet Ted.
You've got enough people kissing your ass.
Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in.
Eventually you'll let go.
But you never do.
Then you won't mind covering that watermelon seed spitting contest next week...
My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh.
Wearing them?  Or humping them?
That's refreshingly deviant.
You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust.
Aw Julie, it's my job. It's like being a doctor.
Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you?
What is all this? When are you coming home?
Only the best for my mother.
Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much.
Don't say "shit," honey. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you.
Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power.
A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything.
Of course I like girls.
As much as possible.
Indeed it is. During the day, visitors prefer to be outside, au naturel. As it were.
YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous?
Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure!
You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms.
Me? The King of Coitus?
You think we should be more open minded?
In other words, our scope is too narrow.
Really? So I'm doing OK?
Seriously? I'm doing all right?
We've got a huge problem with the magazine, Ted-baby. Our readers hate it. HATE IT. We need to talk.
All is fair in "Heaven," Ted-baby.
Well kid, I'm speaking of...your biological parents.
It's spring break. I don't want to go to a will reading.
That's great.  I'll just tell my creditors I'm not a rapist.  No problem... Shit.  I can't believe the board's going to act without even hearing my side of it.
Kelly.
Senior class fund-raising gig.  I told 'em they could hose down the Jeep.  Hey, come on.  It's for a good cause.
What about the blood?
And the child...
I understand.
He kept saying, "Let it happen, let it happen."  Then he just stopped.
She didn't cone home last night.  We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
Ray thinks she was murdered.
Back to the land of grownups.
Hunter's making it our job because Sandra Van Ryan's got a bug up his ass. You know that as well as I do.  We're gonna trash this guy's life and I keep asking myself if it's really necessary.
Yeah, well, Van Ryan got his.  I don't imagine he gives a shit now.
The skinny brunette.
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
What?  You wouldn't go after some guy you thought raped your daughter?  Cone on.  She bought the same story we did...
Ray.  We don't know anything yet.  She could be anywhere...
You have someplace to be?
Just check out the car.
Those are Suzie Toller's teeth.
We don't know that, Ray...
Where's Lombardo?
He dropped Jimmy off first?
So you were alone.
You know what that will mean for Lombardo.
The line I get on this guy, is that he's done half the women in Blue Bay.
I don't believe I'm hearing this.  A month ago you were pulling these two apart at the courthouse.  They were acting.  They were all acting, from the beginning.  And we bought it, hook, line and sinker... And now they're home free with six million of Sandra Van Ryan's money.
You didn't cuff her?
I'm sorry... you said it hurt?  Why?
I said he did.
No!
Yeah, but...
Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me.  You've got family and they've got clout.  With we it's different... with me...
What brain?
Hi, Mon.
Whichever one I want.
I miss Dad.
Where, the mall?
Mr. Lombardo.  We're running kind of late.  How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons?  You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
Why can't you come...
You think that's wise?
That's cop bullshit.
About what?
Is this supposed to mean something to me?  What triangle?
I don't have to listen to this.  And you can't shove me around.  I have friends now...
Shoulda, coulda, woulda...  Get him in the water.
But you can't tell us what she wanted to talk about.
It is and I don't.  Ordinarily...  But, I mean... there's this kid standing in front of you crying...
The bitch shot me, is what happened.
Yes, we call it a winch.  And these are shrouds, and these are stays.
Shut up.  Don't fall apart.  The only people who can blow this is us. Remember?
Good.  Just keep telling yourselves that, the only people who can fuck this up is us.
But then it is better this way, don't you think?  No loose ends.
Can't.  Got a passenger.
What?  Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
Goodbye, Sandra.
You need that real often?
All right, if it'll make you happy, I'll try that.
Is this leading somewhere?
Prepare what?
Whoa, Jim.  Maybe.  But we can't arrest this little pillar of society on maybe.
That?  Oh, it's a kind of Chinese fighting... I was sort of caught once with a lovely Chinese girl out in San Francisco.  Her big brothers were kind enough to teach it to me  I've got a book on it, if you're interested.
At least the thing's not that fast. We just follow it.  Whenever it stops, we're there, waiting.
No, I'm not all right.  They got away.  And we can't even follow them.  They can get off the tracks anywhere they want.
Nothing much to it really.  When I was younger I got into a pretty bad run-in with the Wyler Boys.  I saw them coming.  But I didn't act fast enough.  Second-guessed myself. And it cost me... cost me dearly.
Those kids, they took my wagon. Never got it back.
I thought all you needed were your fists and your gun.
I find most criminals slip up somewhere...
You'd think if Loveless is going to kill him he could at least be a prominent citizen.
Sounds like a train.  Looks like a train.
You said it popped out too easily. Nothing's ever good enough for you, is it?
Oh, no, we split him fifty-fifty.
What?  President Grant is...!
I don't have to tell you what that would do to our careers!
I'd love to stop him, but have you noticed the hundred armed men?
Well, hell, maybe we do have a chance.
Of course not.
What is this?  A whole new train?
Like hell!  I'll see it through! Ram the bastard!
I don't recollect ever being compared to a pistol before.
Well, I owe you one, don't I?
You tell me.
I've had some practice.
Fine, I'll stop.
Well, Captain, then the answer is your train is still here.
A mistake?  To assign this case to the man who blew up all the bridges on the Chattanooga River and single- handedly trapped Jackson's entire cavalry?  How is that a mistake?
That'll be all, boys.
On my way to Denver...
Talk?  About what...?  Oh!  About who you are and all that?
Dr. Loveless?
That would be... the Mexican War?
A glass eye?  That's who it was! One-Eyed Jack Garrison.  Otherwise known as General Garrison, Confederate Third Army.  I saw him at Dr. Loveless' party, but I couldn't place him.  He used to wear an eye-patch.
It's a smelting retort.
You don't know what he's built?! Surely you don't think he kidnapped all those geniuses to have them make something as rudimentary as this.
They're coming.
Right.
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth.
No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me?  I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn!
Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone.
No.  I mean yes.
Let me see it.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
I don't believe you.
Good.  How long will it take?
Are you okay?
These burns.  My arms.  Ouch...
I hate this.
I will.
Of course!  I promise!
Where the hell did you come from?
Because she's sick.
You're crazy.  I think you're in love.
Ahhh!
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter.  She is all that matters.  Are you going to abandon her?
Absolutely not.
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
I'm Willow Ufgood.  I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
Why?
Me neither!
Us??  We'll never catch them.  Any- way, we're all done, Teemo.  Let's go home.
Shut up.
No!  You let us handle this.  Come along, Rool!
How do these work I wonder?  I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen.  We'd better go.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Pretty much.
Pick up the hat.
No pistol. Ever.
You don't say.
...I want to say a thing.
I won't. Now run.  Fast as you can!
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight – street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy.  I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
Just us.
Don't try me, Johnny!
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
But you can't.
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure.  What's that?
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
But... You may not be well enough.
Aren't you? After today?
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
Where's my baggy pants?
I didn't even know about it.
Johnny, what the fuck?
Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch – I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
Say again?
I admit I don't know where he is.
What I know, Paul, is...  He's going to take you out...
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
I have committed no sin.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
My son is out there!
Fifty-seven, fifty-eight --
Oh, but he doesn't do it every day -- just once or twice a week.  And he can't catch her old cat, anyway. And now she says she's gonna get the sheriff, and --
You wicked old witch!  Uncle Henry, Auntie Em, don't let 'em take Toto!  Don't let her take him -- please!
Dorothy.  Dorothy, dear. It's Aunt Em, darling.
There, there, lie quiet now.  You just had a bad dream.
Oh, I hope we got them in time.
Now, we can't go against the law, Dorothy. I'm afraid poor Toto will have to go.
I saw you tinkering with that contraption, Hickory. Now, you and Hunk get back to that wagon!
Well, don't start posing for it now.  Here, here -- can't work on an empty stomach. Have some crullers.
But we've got to verify it legally To see...
If any!
Tap - tap - tap - tap - What was that - that - that? Our echo - echo - echo.
I don't believe you!
Oh ....
Ohhh!
This?
Hickory!
All in good time, my little pretty -- all in good time.
That's a good little girl.  I knew you'd see reason.
That was her sister -- the Wicked Witch of the East. This is the Wicked Witch of the West.  And she's worse than the other one was.
Oh, I'd give anything to get out of Oz altogether -- but which is the way back to Kansas?  I can't go the way I came.
The Wizard of Oz?  Is he good or is he wicked?
Whenever you wish.
There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.
Nobody cares about me at home. They wouldn't even miss me.
My mouth -- my mouth!
...Oh, did that hurt?
Well, you're perfect now.
I'm afraid I'm a little rusty yet.
Oh --
Don't you know the Wizard's going to give you some courage?
Lions and tigers and bears!
Yes.
And -- and I got a permanent just for the occasion.
Not nobody, not nohow!
Why, I'd thrash him from top to bottomamus!
Oh, well, then -- we'll ask him for you.
No, but it's wonderful for threatening with.
Did they hurtcha?
Stay with us, then, Dorothy.  We all love you.  We don't want you to go.
What's the matter -- gonna let a little old pig make a coward out of you?
Oh, well, here -- let me help you.
Ohhhh --
Oh!  Oh!  Ohhh!
No, No -- I -- I just thought you hurt yourself.
But I'd face a whole box full of them for the chance of getting some brains.  Look -- I won't be any trouble, because I don't eat a thing -- and I won't try to manage things, because I can't think.  Won't you take me with you?
Come along, Dorothy -- you don't want any of those apples.  Hmm!
I don't see how.  You weren't around when I was stuffed and sewn together, were you?
Ohh!  OHH!  OHH!
Leave her alone!
Do -- do you think it'll be polite -- dropping in like this?
Dorothy! You can't sleep here! You can't sleep in the middle of a field!
Imposserous!
Yeah --
I hope your tail holds out. Oh --
Not nohow!
Dorothy?  Well, what has Dorothy done?
We do.
A heart --
It's the Wicked Witch!  What'll we do? Help!  HELP!
I haven't got a heart But I got a palpitation.
Now, now, don't fret.
I don't know what we'd have done without you.
Go on!
Well, I --
Th.D.?
Help!
Couldn’t make it. Splitting headache.
So who are you?
I did kill us. She thinks we’re dead. And she thinks she got away with it.
Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor.  He’s not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub’s reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown.
We go down to the torpedo bay.
He’s going to insert the plutonium.
But what if...
I need you to pass me fit now, Molly.
The doctor who saved him couldn’t get it out, so Renard killed him. When Interpol found the x-rays, there was mild jubilation. Effectively, he’s a dead man.
He’s not through yet. Renard doesn’t blow up five million dollars unless he knows there’s more coming in. He’s working for someone. Someone who wants to stop the pipeline.  And they hired the perfect killer. One with a vendetta against King...and you.
The worm on the hook again.
Your last chance. Give me the name.
Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune.
You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn’t have done it without you.
Funerals aren’t exactly memorable.
It’s my father’s pin. He wore it everyday of his life.
It’s not the pin your father wore. It’s an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company.
You are wrong, Mr. Bond. In fact, I am the only person who can do it.
I know.
Two. Shaken not stirred.
Someone wants to kill me, I’d rather die looking him straight in the eye.  What are you doing here?  Looking for a woman a little more your type? How about that one?
You had your chance, James. Now I’m looking for a bigger thrill.
Not at that price. Time to surrender.
You turned Renard.
Oh James.
She’s no innocent.  This is my nuclear consultant.
A rope!
This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out!
The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea.
What class sub does your nephew run?
Someone will come.
Yes.  Au revoir...
And expensive.  Cost three million plus.
Anywhere in this circle.  Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Syria, Afghanistan...
Still no contact yet.
Laurie, I'll have to ask you to come with me.
The weather.  I see.  Keep me posted.  I want hourly forecasts and a full report on optimum strike conditions.
Small army, from the looks of it.  He put up one hell of a fight.
Don't call me that.
Why, doctor.  I did.  He was a bad dog.
Saw the world that night -- random, empty, hideous.  God didn't make it that way.  We did.  We make the world -- in our own image.  What else can I illuminate?
Jon!  Get back!  You don't understand.
Yes.  I heard this morning.  Washington's asked me to attend the funeral as a matter of protocol.
Space and time.  I finally understand, Laurie.  I see it all now.
Dan, are you really that paranoid?  Let's face it, Eddie Blake was no Mother Teresa.
Oh yeah.  The one that used to confess to everything?  Hoping we'd beat him up?
Oh, yeah.  They gave me a clean bill of health and then booted me the hell out.  No expense account.  No place to live.
No, screw that.  What you were saying before, it's absolutely right.  -- I'd love to have you stay.
The Comedian . . . Jon . . . now Rorschach.
One more down.  Someone tried to kill Adrian.  . . . First time I've ever heard him scared.
I know what you're thinking.  You'd be a lot safer if I weren't around.
-- I thought it was time for a routine maintenance check.
Would you want to sit out a war?  I mean -- what would be left.
What are you up to?
That Detroit shit?  I'm so worried.
The costumes.  Am I right?
That's because --
What now?  Fly south -- hook up with Adrian?
Did anybody follow you?  See you come here?
Blake investigating missing scientists for CTU.  Dr. Manhattan somehow involved . . . 
Come on, Rorschach.  Gimme a break --
Okay, let's just . . . thank you.
The guidance system's fried.  I had to switch to manual.  -- Some kind of massive electromagnetic shockwave.
Don't know.  Nothing I can think of --  -- outside of a nuclear blast.
He's the one.  He's been the one all along.  Stalking us.
Isn't it true that you --
That's it.  This is all a trick, isn't it?  Some kind of horrible joke to make me --
Am I free to go?
Jon??  You mean he's --
Worked both sides of the fence.  Ask your old buddies in the CTU.
No, no.  You got it all wrong.  I been on the case, Rorschach, I got something for you.
Looks like a diner.
Good for you. Now why don't you stop wasting my time and tell me what you want. You didn't go through all this for my benefit.
You know what I hate? Any scumbag with a clean shirt and a bad haircut can get one of those tin stars and suddenly they think they're God.
If you find out what I want to know, and if I'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. If not, you take a bath.
Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5.
If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X.
Yeah, I sent you pictures. Here's what I'm thinking. If they take out the cameras and sensors, they could probably put a bomb in this thing. You drop it in the water in the Red Sea and three weeks later it's swimming up the Potomac.
I'm pretty happy to see me too. So are you done with me yet?
You're a jerk-off, you know that?
Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life.
They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands.
Oh, I don't know. It was an accident.
You wanna check it out? Come here.
Oh. I bet by the end he gets something out of it.
Is she for real? Honey, maybe you should quiet down and let the grownups have a conversation.
The eyes don't lie. All this has gotten to you, hasn't it, Petra? You came in as Yorgi's girlfriend and you stayed because it was fun. Now you don't like it so much, but you're in so deep you can't get out anymore. Tell me if I'm wrong, Petra.
Let's just say I'm freelancing and leave it at that.
So there you have it. I guess you just have to ask yourself, how bad to you want out?
If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me.
I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal.
I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now.
It doesn't matter anymore, forget it.
Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them.
I thought that was in detail.
You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore.
You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that.
Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now.
I was gonna wait till the islands, but...
Here we go again.
Yeah, thanks a lot.
What's the deal?
Why you dogging me up?
A parachute. This does not argue well.
He's a pretty good actor, though.
It's like you said, every man for himself.
Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.
It'll work faster if I have an account number.
I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem...
Of course.
You wanna see my politics?
"...try walking into a deli and urinating on the cheese". 'Anarchy Burger' by the Vandals.
You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well?
That's alright, I'm kinda tired.
Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run.
You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind.  It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
We all do.
I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
For what purpose?
His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.
Well, I think that's perfectly understandable.
What's that?
Into the Hudson?
Some cigars.  Case of beer.
Were you now?
Control, Senator...  we teach them control.
This.  This whole God damn thing.  Making yourselves into some sort of "team" of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature.  For what?
No.  That's me talking.  And you know what?  It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
We were friends once...  But that was a long time ago.
They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
What?... miss me?  Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
The sun is setting, Logan.  You've been asleep for nineteen hours.
How?
Not at the cost of lives, Max.
What do you want with him?
Dr. Frederick Fronkonsteen.
Poppycock!
Yes, sir.  But I must have taken the wrong one when we came up.
Here!  This cauliflower is useless to me.
What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
Baack!
MMMmmmm.
MMmmm.
Yes, don't worry.
Very....very!
Goodbye, darling.
Yes.  I am a bit tired, after all.
You've done everything that's humanly possible, Frederick.  Oh, darling, I'm so worried about you -- you need rest.
Of course I am.  Now give me a kiss and say good night like my good boy.
This is the only library I know of.
I think you must be mistaken, sir.
Will there be anything else?
This wire came while you were gone. Your fiancee will be arriving any moment.
A week.  Ten days at most.
But aren't you the grandson of the famous Dr. Victor Frankenstein?... who performed such fascinating experiments in electricity and galvanism?
How old are you, young man?
I'm sure we will.
What?
What?
'How I Did It.'  Good title!
Tonight?
Don't fall for that one.
You can say that again.
You're just supposed to repeat what you said.
What did you find out?
Can you play it?
What d'ya mean "What monster?' You remember...the one we madein the basement.
I like your style, master.  How do we get him here?
Is everything ready?
MMMmmmm!  MMMmmmm!
Diff'rent types who wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat, perfect fits.........................
...Su-per du-per. Come let's mix where Rock- e-fellers walk with sticks or 'um-ber- el-las' in their mitts.........................
It's an honor for me, sir.  You play the violin?
That's quite all right.  What is it, dear?
Yes!  What could it be at this hour?
Well, this explains the music.
I think you've done it, master.
Stop -- singing!!!
Good night!
Why certainly.  Don't you, Frau Blucher?
Oh, Igor -- I'm so afraid!  I just hope this all ends well.
Sounds like visitors.  It's all right -- Frau Blucher will show them in.
Oh, no sir-ee.  If yo don't have a reservation you can skip to ma-loo.
Franz!  Help!  Lunatic!
Could be.  Across the river into Zululand. . They might just be waiting there for us to show up... .them stabbing assegais pointing right at our bellies!....
One Zulu is only one man.. ..and I'm afeared of no one man... but the Zulu, they come in the thousands.... like a black wave of death.... in the thousands.... and them assegais.... stabbing!
Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and the like but it don 't mean to say they got no brains. They'll watch us  and wait  and find our weaknesses.
Excuse me, My Lord.  Norris-Newman, of "The Standard", My Lord.
Sikali Horse, My Lord. Christians alL I know each one by name.
Thank you.
Well, my horses are feeding, as you may observe, Mr Coghill. It'll take a little while.
Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who can ride and shoot
