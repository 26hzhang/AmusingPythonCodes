Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Hi.
do you listen to this crap?
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
She okay?
Where did he go?  He was just here.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge.  And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Neat...
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Where've you been?
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
You the new guy?
How many people were in your old school?
That I'm used to.
He always have that shit-eating grin?
What makes you think he'll do it?
You got him involved?
This is it.  A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Assail your ears for one night.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
What'd you do to her?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns .  That's a direct quote
Where ya goin?
Hey.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you.  You know, just to see if you're interested.
Who's that?
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Have you seen him?
Pick you up Friday, then
Why 're you doing this?
Why?
So what ' s up with your dad?  He a pain in the ass?
So what did I have an effect on ?
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
Put your right foot there --
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
It's just something I had.  You know
Why can't we agree on this?
As a parent, that's my right
Bianca did what?
Katarina Stratford.  My, my.  You've been terrorizing Ms. Blaise again.
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Cool pictures.  You a fan?
So you got cozy with she who stings?
I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well?
Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid?
You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up?
What's a synonym for throbbing?
What do you wanna watch?  We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
What are you listening to, chicken ass?
Your Eminence, there is only one way to settle the matter.  And that is to make the journey.  I am ready to risk my life to prove it possible.
I haven't given you much of a life.
Are we going to argue?
Perhaps I was never meant to live with a woman...
God... you're so beautiful!  I can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...
Can't you stay with us a little?
What does he say?
I remind you, Senor Colon, that you are in no position to bargain with me.
You defend yourself admirably...
I am not afraid of you.  You are nothing but a dreamer.
Say not here!  Cuba!
You come!  You speak first!
We will work with his people.  We want peace.  Ask the Chief if he understands?
Why do you wish to sail west?
How can you be so certain?  The Ocean is said to be infinite.
You get so carried away when you are being contradicted!
If God intends you to go, then you will go.
I am listening, my son.
May God forgive you...!  You must tell them!  You must tell your men!
I believed in you...
New worlds create new people.
I should not even be listening to you, since my council said no.  But Santangel tells me you are a man of honor and sincerity... And Sanchez, that you are not a fool.
The ocean is uncrossable?
I cannot ignore the verdict of my council.
Do they have such thoughts?
We can't raise the wheel without it.
You were right, Don Sanchez... His demands could never be granted.
... Into a monk...
... But there is worse.  He ordered the execution of five members of the nobility...
Don't say anything.
Well, you didn't appreciate the severity of it until recently.  No question about that.
Don't worry about him.  Think about yourself.
I need to know about your background.  I need to know about your upbringing.  Why you're here.
Your father blamed you for your mother's blindness?
Are you married?
The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires.
You considered becoming a prostitute?
I'll make some for us.
Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own.
I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything.
Look, we can help you but right now we have to deal with what's happening here. Tell us the truth...is that the truth?
Oh.
Then why didn't you talk to the reporter?
The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King!
How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield.
Coffee for me, I gotta slow down.
Sorry...PD only.
Only one guys checked in?
Who's there?
Tall, short-haired, scary eyes.  Second guy with him was...shorter, with a wrestler's build.  And he wouldn't turn his videocamera off me.
Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do.
Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff.
The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here.
Hmmmm.
Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell.
Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's.
So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back.
Why not?
C'mon.  You intimidate her 'cause you're a celebrity.  She sees me differently.
Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her.
So...who's Nicky?
Your opinion.  You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books.
So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Eddie, are you okay?
Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh?
Okay.
Thank you.
So we're waitin' to hit this warrant - we got Emergency Service with the heavy weapons standin' by - ready to go.  I say, lemme get a cigar outta the car.  I go to get the cigar and BOOM!  All the sudden I turn around and a kid with a shotgun let one go.  Right where I was standin'.  That coulda been it.  I coulda had my head blown off and for what?  Some stupid kid got panicky, takes the safety off and it's over.  If I hadn't gone back for that cigar - for a bad habit - I would've had my head blown off.
I think you're getting a little moody there, Eddie.
Ready?
Are you married?
We'll talk about that.  Four o'clock gives you time to go to bank.  Three hundred thousand dollars.
If you don't want my film - I'll call another show.  And they will show it.
You can't kill me.  You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun.  I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States?
Please join us.  Come on forward.
In here, says he wants a million.
Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth.
Get in the bathroom!
Okay.  He has nothing to say.  Start the camera!
Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding.
Take your eyes off her, Oleg!  Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught.  It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!!
Viewer discretion advised!
Isn't he a little moody?
Yeah?
And you, you'll pay for what you did!
New York.
Yes.  No.  Both.  When I was a boy, I see movie at school called "It's a Wonderful Life" directed by Frank Capra. Ever since I want to come to America. Land of the free.  Home of the brave.  A land where anyone can be anything. As long as they are white.
Got any spare change?  How 'bout a spare twenty?
You okay?
Yeah?  What kind?
Room was registered to a Francis Capra.
SPACE STATTION 5 - LOUNGE
CONTINUED
Okay. 
I suppose it isn't logically impossible.
Well, that's something.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm wide awake. What's up?
The unit is still operational, Dave. but it will fail within seventy-two hours.
You probably also know that we found them okay.
Is your confidence in me fully restored?
Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous operation.
Look, Dave your've probably got a lot to do. I suggest you leave it to me.
I am prepared to do that anyway.

When are you coming home?
Where is Mrs. Brown?
Okay, sweetheart. Well, I have to go now. Tell Mommy that I called.
Okay, sweetheart. Have a lovely Birthday Party tomorrow.
Well, I've heard more and more people talk of an epidemic.
Well, Gregor and I will look forward to seeing you.
Well.. Did you have a pleaant flight?
Yes, I think so. Just about then.
Oh, I really don't have time for a drink. If it's all right I'll just sit for a minute and then I've got to be off.
Well, as it happens, I'm on my way up to the moon
Yes, well at first we thought that was the explanation, but it's been going on for the past ten days.
Yes, and I'm afaid there's going to be a bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention.
Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward question?
This epidemic could easily spread to our base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.
Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.
Has it been exposed to any sun before now?
What do you mean?
That's true
Name?
That we do. And we put air in the tires. I'll even sell you some gas if you need it.
I'm tellin' ya, I'm giving you all I know.
Pay money?
They always let me do anything. I don't want to pay for it.  I never paid for it in my life.
Hey, what about me?
I'm candy...
Hey, don't you think a hair stylists got any interest in gettin' it on?
Well, maybe I'll see you later ...
Hello, again.
You lying son of a bitch...
We're supposed to be after a killer, not a string of hookers...
I don't need to hear your jive. I already got that department taken care of...
Hey, no way.  Take off the bracelets or no deal.
I don't give a damn.  It happens to be my name.
Luther ain't the reliable type. I don't want you shot yet, Cates ... not before you been a help to me.
We're on the move. Let's go. As they walk toward a corridor.
Well?
You tell me what Ganz busted out for, he's after a lot more than just gettin' out of jail.  And whatever it is, you're part of it.
There.
You son of a bitch. You knew where the money was all along and all we had to do was come here and wait. I almost got my ass blown off twice tonight for nothing.
You took a big chance, leaving this here all this time.
Doesn't it get... Tiring?
No class...
Hey, Jack, how ya doin'? What took you so long to call, man? I been waitin' ... I'm at Vroman's up in the Fillmore. Yeah, Vroman's... 'Course you don't hang out here; it's for the brothers.
What about Luther?
We missed.
I don't know why, but I'm going to let you keep it. Maybe because you told me you had it, or maybe just because I'm too tired to argue...
Yeah, I see her.
Hey, how'd my car get here?
Hey, there she is...
Yeah, and I know Ganz sure ain't no sweetheart... I wouldn't like it if this partnership ended before it gets started.
No, you don't. If I ever get word of you steppin' over the line again, I'm gonna ventilate that suit of yours.
Yeah...
You really know how to send a guy out with a great attitude. He starts to go.
What the bell happened?
Don't duck the bullet Cates. Why didn't you call in for backup instead of makin' a grandstand play?
Where the Christ do you think you're going?
Somebody steals your gun, you're supposed to file a report.
Bullshit red tape.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
Hey, you're right.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Thanks for the coffee.
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop.  It's not a practical way to function...
Hey, I don't believe it.
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions.  I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
Three more hours...
We got a lot to talk about.
I want the money, asshole, what do you think?  The money that Reggie hid...
Let her go.
You want to go outside?
How about some ammo?
Don't mess with me. How much?
Five.  On credit.
What're you laughing about?
...We're saved!
Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it!  This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
They all like this in your family, father?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What are we going to do?
It's a miracle!!!
Father.  You sure she's the Supreme Being?
They really made her...
You're all safe. Thanks be to God!
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Hello?
Daya deo dono Dato.  Dalutan!
When EVIL returns so shall we.
...Hello?
Fuel level 6.03..Propulsion 2x4...
You have nine points left on your license..
I'm sorry..
Six to the left. One to the right.
Maybe we oughta be going, what do you think?
Major Dallas, if our calculations are correct you still have 57 hours owed to the Federal Army on your enlistment which is more than you will need for a mission of the utmost importance.
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
...Shit!
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
Which one?
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
You get that off the screen?
You noticed..
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
...Like love...
Tell me...
The cash man!
It's not?
This is all that survived?
Mr. President, let me introduce you to Professor Mactilburgh, who runs the center.
They just landed in the desert.
Is that better?
I have to address the Supreme Council in 10 minutes. Just the facts, General.
Wait or act.
Father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.
Drink!
How's that? Can you hear me better now?
Who gives a shit! I didn't come here to listen to music! Listen up instead of running off at the mouth! The batteries on my phone are almost gone.
Dispatch me another ZFX200 immediately. Someone stole mine.
How's our deal coming along?
The Stones will be here. I'll see to it personally!
What's this... have you been smoking... ?
I'm not accusing you...
Amy, just listen.  Take Cindy and get out of the house.  Do it now. Go to a hotel and stay there...
What happened to you?
Look where we are.  Look at yourself.  You son of a bitch, you don't have any idea what you're putting me through...
What was I supposed to think happened to you?!
Anything harder?
It's an honor to meet you.  Thank you for seeing us.
You said something about money.
Excellent.
I'll get it.  It's in a safe deposit box, in the city...
Alright, Tom.
I figured you share information.
They were pretty clear they didn't want this coming back on them.
Celebrity Films.
Yeah, who's this?
What?
What do you want to know?  You saw it, you saw the loop...
You can't go to the cops.  All you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...
You got absolute zero.
Do it.
You know how my tapes sell.  People eat this stuff up.
Except, you're willing commit murder with them.
Mary Anne Mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.
You almost went over your limit.
Give me the film.
Big date tonight?
Once you pick it up you can't put it down.
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.
How long you been working there?
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
Not quite.
Here's my number if you need it...  When can you start?
... Hello... ?
Where are your parents?
I don't mean any offense... but what are you doing mixed up in all this?
What about me?
Dino Velvet... yeah, he's like the John Luc Godard of S+M flicks, supposed to be a real weirdo.
You're learning.
Wha... ?
I know if I had to pick, it'd be "Choke," or "Devil."
Still don't want to tell me what you're doing?
Mister Welles. You're very prompt.
His passing has left me with... something of a dilemma.  A terrible, terrible dilemma.
Pittsburgh?
He succeeded.
Nothing remotely like this.
Totalled together, these five checks from five different accounts, they equal one million dollars.
Hello... ?
I'm sorry, let me explain, the R.C.M.P. is a support organization and archive, not unlike the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington.  I'm sure you've dealt with them before?
What was the name... ? I've got it here somewhere...
Right, Agent Cole told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.  He didn't call?
It's very important you don't let this raise your expectations.  It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.  All I'm saying is, please know, I'm not here to create any false hope.
September 4th, 1993.  About a year after Mary disappeared.
I've got what I need for my report. There is... there is one thing that bothers me though.
I think about it everyday.  But, every time the phone rings... every single time, I still think it's her.
Hello... ?
Do you know what happened to her?
No, sir, he is not.
Okay, I'll take it all.
Don't you think it kind of defeats the purpose?
We'll figure it out.
I know.  I hardly have any time to study.
Try what other kids did.  Keep each other awake.  We'll meet at Debbie's tonight. At least if we don't sleep he can't get us.
He's going after Debbie, I gotta stop him.
I think Sheila's more interested in dissecting bodies than just admiring them.
Asthma attack...what 17-year old has a fatal asthma attack?  She was gonna be a doctor.
So what's up?  What'd I miss?
Something the matter with the cuisine?
What is it?
We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
Is that who you're waiting for?
No you're not.  You don't even care about being a mom.  How come you don't think about me?
Where is he?
But how...?
Hi, beautiful.
The tickets.
Where are we going?
How was the meeting?
Alice!
No!  I won't have you running around in the middle of the night.  You're coming home.
Did everyone call everyone?
What's that got to do with it?
Look...we're all tired.  None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
Are you alright?
You think that's the place she's buried?
You do good work, Alice.
My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.
Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
They think I'm nuts.
No, it's our problem, Mark.  If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.  You said she committed suicide?
Dan.  And he's taking Alice with him -- pretty good dive Yvonne.  You've been practicing.
It's okay.
You, too?
I should have suspectcd, when I heard that 'Doctor.'  I thought it was your father.
What did you mean:  I'm 'out?'
Wearing a uniform doesn't bestow an automatic monopoly on courage, <u>Commander</u>!  It just so happens I'm <u>not</u> a coward - physical or mental - and before I'd risk my father's life...
Now, Dave Old Buddy, you know you're exaggerating -  What do you think of this husband of yours?  On most boats a certain loyalty exists between the Exec and his Navigation and Firing Officer.  But unfortunately, in the case of Lieutenant Dave Milburn of the Tiger Shark and myself -
I don't hear anything.  Maybe you've been down here too long.  Why don't you go back up and -
Skipper - could you take a look here...?
We're dead in the water.  But it indicates we're moving!
It's possible I could adapt one of the torpedo guidance systems to the ICBM - so it would 'home' on the saucer when he rises from the Pole.
We took for granted his source of energy was nuclear.  But suppose it isn't at all - what if it's <u>magnetic</u>?
All ready?
Suppose there's an atmosphere, of some kind, inside Cyclops?
It is a living thing.  When damaged - you would say 'wounded' - it immediately 'heals' itself.
Due north.  At five knots...no, six!
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. $364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
Chub says you're fired.
I plan to. Soon.
You see it?
Might as well take the rest of the day off. You look sort of fucked up. You've been paid for the day, anyhow, right?
Maybe I can buy him off. I gotta talk to Mel.
Done much shooting with that rifle yet?
Mmm.
I get it.  No sweat. You'll get yourself a deer and you'll get him dead. And you'll have him by coffee time.
Double A. New Britain.
This way.
No brag. Just fact.
No, I mean whereabouts.
Where'd you get the blood?
You musta seen him get shot. I know you did.
Yeah.
Those are the Hoyts.
Why do they do that?
Some party, huh? Sorry I lost sight of you. I had to step outside for a smoke. You find anybody you know here? There must be some kids you used to know from school. You want to go tomorrow? See your old teachers? Be more fun than hanging out with me all day.
No what?
You are home. There are lots of kids you still know here.
Jesus, why?
She's gone already!  Gone already! Couldn't wait.
That's all you got to say? "Yes".
Are we going in this?
How about a Big Mac?
What do you want, then?
You can't have nothing, Jill. We need lunch. Mr. Pizza?
Don't go playing policeman.
Fuck. Turn it off.  All you heard was there was some kinda accident?
On what you pay me?
Wade, you're done.  Let me have the shop keys.
Lillian!
Me and Jill, we just had a little spat. She felt kind of left out, I guess, from not knowing some of the new kids --
We should talk.
See. Get your boots.
Are you okay, Wade? What was wrong? Why were you holding everyone up?
You don't mean that.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
No, I just know Jack's lying about what happened. He just seemed -- I know that kid, what he's like inside. He's a lot like I was at his age.
Oh, Wade.
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
Going somewhere, Margie?
You're not using it today?
Whitehouse. Next time, phone ahead.
I said, 'Next time, phone ahead.'
What the hell are you talking about?
The sign. It looks like it's spelled wrong or something.
The other guy.
CB. Little while ago. One of the boys on the way in picked up Jack on the CB calling for state troopers. I figured you'd know what really happened. The fucking guy kill himself? This Twombley, who the fuck is he, anyhow?
Wade, I got a message for you.  Jack Hewitt, he's looking for you. Wants you to clear your stuff out of his office in Town Hall.
You remember Margie Fogg?
Listen, it's no big deal, Pop.
Yeah, brother, look, I was calling cause -- has there been anything on TV in Boston about a hunting accident with a guy named Twombley, Evan Twombley?
Lillian was here. In Lawford.
The night before the shooting.
Picked up Jill. She was supposed to visit for the weekend for Halloween. She wanted to go home.
Don't think about it. You're exhausted.
Get some sleep.
What about Margie?
Right's right, goddamnit! Don't you care what's right?
It may have happened, but not the way you said.
It wasn't me. I wasn't there, but I heard about it. When I heard about it, it was about Elbourne.
And Elbourne and Mom took you to the doctor and told him you fell from the hay loft.
Then you accidentally see your body, or your face, or whatever, and you don't know who the hell it belongs to. Strange. It's the business with the old man, I know, and how incredibly pissed I was at him, and also chasing Jack Hewitt like that, and the Goddamned truck going through the ice, not to mention Margie's being so upset -- one thing on top of another.
To help, Jack, of course -- and to nail those sonsofbitches, the Two Gordons. That's what Alma calls them. Jesus, Rolfe, whose side are you on?
Mom, just this once, give it a rest.
I know...  But lotsa times I feel like it's me versus the world.  Some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in Bangladesh.  I mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.
I don't drink coffee.
Yeah, I study world events. Five thousand Turkienistan Muslims were slaughtered in Stravanvitch's cleansings... along with 15 American school kids. You know hQw I studied that. I went to their funerals with my dad. I met their parents.
Pop it open. There should be a red switch, toggle it up.
It's cut.
Mr. President, it's an honor. Now with your permission can we lead you the fuck out of here.
Who's flying the fucking plane?
Uh, we got a problem here.
No. We're losing fuel and my rudder's not responding.
It was a good ad-lib, sir.
General Greely says it looks like the Middle East.
The Chief Justice? What on earth for?
Why?
The rest of the secret service?
How many others killed?
Who did this?
Tower, Air Force One has been boarded.
This is Romeo Tango Zulu changing call signs.  Tower, alert air traffic, Romeo Tango Zulu is now Air Force One.  This is Air Force One... The President is safe onboard.
Here's a press kit.  I'll let you guys get comfortable and once we're airborne I'll be able to schedule the interviews.
I'm responsible for Press Relations for the Flight Office.
Leave my daughter alone.
What do you know of my husband?
But they are not ny people. You look at me as if I am a monster, but answer me this -- when your planes bombed the oil fields of Iraq, did You cry for those dark skinned men whose names you do not know and who's faces You will never see? Did You cry for their wives and children. They were people too, yes... but they were not your people.
Shall I begin by executing the President's daughter? She's right here.
Nor will there be. My husband does not negotiate with terrorists.
Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
Stop.
The fax machines.
One.
Yeah, right.
Thank you for calling the white House...
*                     CBS said they'll give us four minutes.  They thought the Russian was a nice touch.
With all due respect, sir, maybe you should give them this one.  Your numbers are still pretty low and you called in a lot of chips to nail Stravanavitch.
You give me ulcers.
Mr. President, how the hell did you get on board?
Shepherd.
Shut down accelerators.
Dunn.
It's got to be stopped!
Ted, what's wrong?
Elaine.
His name's David Stockman.  He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
Ted, we're taking off!
Ted.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
I'd use the word insane.
Elaine, I'm going back there.  Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
So you see, our task isn't made any easier by Ted's refusal to admit that he's sick.
The brain is an amazingly complex organ, Elaine.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
I guess this is a first for you.
Elaine!  Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart.  I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
Can't we change course?
My career is shot.
That's not possible.
Come on up, Jimmy.  Say, that's some puppy.  What's his name?
A couple eggs and juice would be nice, Mary.  Over.
He's carrying a bomb.
Captain Oveur?
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
You folks need any help?
Say, isn't that Dr. Barrington, the world- renowned agronomist?
You're tired, Striker, overworked.  That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
Striker.
No.  I mean your relationship.
Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
...but after...awhile...you begin to...  ...get used to it.
Captain, how soon can we land?
What is it, Doctor? What's happening?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
And get that finger out of your ear. You don't know where that finger's been! Gunderson?
Did you decide on a runway yet?
He's all over the place! Nine hundred feet up to thirteen hundred feet! What an asshole!
I'm Lisa. Oh, you have a guitar!
There's a little girl on board who's ill and...
Fourteen-B. It's halfway down on your right.
Excuse me, sir. Would you like some coffee before we serve dinner?
Excuse me, sir. There's been a little problem in the cockpit and I was wondering...
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Oooh.  Hardball.  That sounds interesting.  Are you going to strike me?  You could tie me up and then do whatever you want with me... I've got my own ropes.
Look, I don't know where Mr. Strader might be.  He comes and he goes.
I like my horizons narrow.
So what've you got on Tuggle's killers?
Move a finger, Harcourt, and you're history...
That cop, the human, he was the one who killed Anderson and the driver.
The guys at the mini-mart last night made a half-assed stab at the money in the till -- but I don't think that's what they were there for.  I think we got us a couple'a executions on our hands, George...
A large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. My spouse's brother is one.
Who is he?
Your health...
I'm going home.
She's going to divorce me.
Well, let's roll, George.
How potent?
Jesus, this is major.  Why didn't you tell me sooner? Why'd you hold out on me?
But there's no more drug.
How do I look?
Yeah, right.  Don't push your luck. Anyway, according to the sheet, the guy you nailed outside by the car--
Oh, here's an extra headshot if you need one.  We're just about to start cutting in.  You're welcome to stick around if you want.  It's really fascinating stuff.
You guys finished the postmortem on Strader yet?
What?
Does that look at all suspicious to you?
Okay, let's do it.
First squad up, on line.  Hicks, get yours in a cordon.  Watch the rear.
Flame-units only.  I want rifles slung.
Could it be intelligent?
That's it.  See it?  Emergency venting.
I'll go.
Amy.
You read my deposition...it's complete and accurate.
What about you?  What's your interest in this?
You never said anything about an android being here!  Why not?
That the atmosphere processor?
You son of a bitch.
You've been doing your homework. Look, they can't impound it if they don't know about it.
These Colonial Marines are some tough hombres, and they're packing state-of-the-art firepower. Nothing they can't handle...right, Lieutenant?
Looks like you company can write off its share of this colony.
What's he scanning for?
Where are your parents?  You have to try...
At ease.  I'm sorry we didn't have time to brief before we left Gateway but...
Hah!  Stop your grinnin' and drop your linen!  Found 'em.
We're not making that out too well.  What is it?
The corner!  Ready?
Seventeen meters.
They're in the approach corridor.
Now many?
It's game time.
Hicks, don't let him leave.
Ellen.
Thanks.
We need the other drop-ship.  The on one the Sulaco.  We have to bring it down on remote, somehow.
Fifteen meters.
So what do I tell this guy?
And how are we today?
Bad dreams again?  Do you want something to help you sleep?
They'd be here if they could, honey.  I know they would.
Ripley...she doesn't have bad dreams because she's just a piece of plastic.
Burke!  Open the door!
I knew you'd come.
Can we dream?
A sweetheart or a pretty little wife is Papageno's wish. A willing, billing, lovey dovey Would be My most tasty little dish. Be my most tasty little dish! Be my most tasty little dish!
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
What's that?
What?
Oh - excuse me!
No, she's fine.
No! I won't have him back.
Why what, sir?
I've come to dinnnnnner!
In the pot, I have got a good dinner. Not a sausage or stew, but a singer. Not a sausage or stew but a singer. Is the treat that I'll eat for my meat!
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
No!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
I don't know.
What?
You're not going to do this?
Why not?
Frau Mozart?
These are originals?
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
Why you?
Look, you little clown, do you know how many people I've hired for you? Do you know how many people are waiting?
He's adorable!
Hey!
A-flat, Majesty.
My pleasure.
You already commissioned an opera from Mozart.
Majesty, I don't like to talk against a fellow musician.
Do you like this, Salieri?
And now he has returned the compliment. Herr Salieri composed that March of Welcome for you.
So then you like it? You really like it, Your Majesty?
What do you mean, Sire?
Mozart, are you aware I have declared the French play of Figaro unsuitable for our theatre?
It is not your place to ask questions. Is it true?
Guess! Guess, Majesty. Imagine the longest time such a thing could last, then double it.
Yes, sir.
Yes, what about him?
Do you always live like this?
I don't know. It's not important. I mean, I don't want pupils. They get in the way. I've got to have time for composition.
Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say!
Don't worry, I'm not staying here to be a burden.
Ah! Here she comes. Fraulein Lorl, good morning.
Thank you. Are you well today, Fraulein Lorl?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
That's right.
Yes.
Look, I asked you if we could start rehearsal next week and you said yes.
I'm sorry. No.
Dear Mozart, my sincere congratulations.
So you are. How is your pretty wife?
I have just come from the palace. The post has been filled.
My dear Mozart, there is no one in the world I would rather help, but now it is too late.
Do you have a daughter?
Well, could you lend me some money till you have one? Then I'll teach her for free. That's a promise. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm being silly. Papa's right - I should put a padlock on my mouth. Seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? Only for six months, eight at most. After that I'll be the richest man in Vienna. I'll pay you back double. Anything. Name your terms. I'm not joking. I'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over Europe!
Why bother with Orsini-Rosenberg? He's obviously no friend of yours.
You burned the score?
With all my heart, Mozart.
I know, I know. Perhaps you should give me some lessons in that.
How long will you give me?
Oh no. It is a sublime piece. The grandest operone. I tell you, you are the greatest composer known to me.
What?
Good. Now the tenors. Fourth beat of the first measure - C.  Con-fu-ta-tis.  Second measure, fourth beat on D.  Ma-le-dic-tis.  All right?
Do you have me?
Would you stay with me while I sleep a little?
I am so ashamed.
So?
Where?
I can't say I do. What is it?
Of course. The man you accuse yourself of killing.
No, you didn't!
I've just learned something that might be of interest to you, Herr Director.
Mozart is writing a new opera. An Italian opera.
He's setting that play to music?
Well, Mozart is already rehearsing.
Yes, absolutely. Is there a ballet in Figaro?
That lady is back, sir.
Can we come in?
But he's all right?
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Surely you're not suggesting...
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
Shall I send a car?
What do you dream about?
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
The bedroom.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
But, David.
I've left those pills for you.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
How are we feeling tonight?
He all right?
All right, you two, move along.
There's no call for that kind of language.
Who is this girl?
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
It's nearly eight. I'm off duty shortly, then I'm off to the films with Alex.
An American film about the Mafia called 'See You Next Wednesday', and I want to see it badly, so you give me no problems and go to sleep.
You're in a hospital in London.
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
There were witnesses?
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
You're not having a good time are you?
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
What about it?
What the hell was that all about?
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
You really scared me, you shithead.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
It's you, David.
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
You're not real.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Because this must be stopped.
What's that?
Oh.
I don't rightly know, sir.
No kidding?
Where's Matt?
Yeah. He'll have a tough time thinking up a wise-crack for this one . . .
About twenty-four thousand.
Yeah.
Let me have ten bucks?
Where you been?
And listen, wise guy - I'm setting friend time clock for exactly nine o'clock, so no squawks out of you guys in the morning.
When he comes in, tell him we're waiting for him in the board room.
What good will that do?
I hope you don't mind me asking you a few questions, Mr. Cluett.
That is simple, isn't it? I assume you can prove that if necessary.
Thanks.
I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . .  You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
You know what we do to welchers, Cluett, don't you?
That's your funeral. We've got fifty thousand dollars comin' to us.
What do you mean?
Dude - there's not any chance of my becoming involved in this, is there?
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Why are you so anxious?
And now fair woman, I have you in my power.
Well, I thought I'd like to have a little talk with you.
Oh, I did have a date with you tonight, didn't I?
Yes, of course.
Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
Longer.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
Come on in here, Helen. Bring your book. I want some numbers to try to get some action. Get Parker at the Union-Leeds - the Exchange . . . Winslow and old man Harris at the Home Mortgage. Snap into it, Helen. Just as quick as you can.
You haven't got a uniform?
We haven't got much time left, Mr. Dickson. We've got to do something quick or it'll be too late.
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
Yes, sir.
The fools! If they only knew it, they're making things worse for themselves. Somebody starts a silly rumor, and they lose their heads.
Yes, sir.
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
What did you do with it?
No.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
In Cluett's office?
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
What did you find out, Mike?
Dude Finlay?
Yes, I guess it was one, 'cause...
But I wasn't here, Mr. Dickson. Honest I wasn't . . .
Gatling! They've got a Gatling!
Never thought that pissant town would look so pretty.
That's what the newspapers say. Weren't for Jesse James, this gang wouldn't be able to find a goat's ass with a stick.
I ain't done --
"The outlaws calling themselves the James-Younger Gang shot their way out of town, wounding the Sherriff and three other townsfolk."
This is about the "Wanted!" Posters, isn't it.
Hands off your hip, Cole.
Thanks for the help.
This isn't a feud, this is war. They've got more men than we do. We kill detectives, they can replace 'em in a day.
The James-Younger Gang.
See, Frank's being smart about this.
Smells funny, it being mentioned in the paper.
A bad idea.
Bob, rip up some bandages.
WHAT?! We follow you for a year, and now that our blood's been spilled, you're gonna quit?!
You know, you gettin' caught, right after leaving us, some people thought --
Some Indian tracker you turned out to be, Tom.
What the --
I think one of 'em's glass.
Oh, Lord, the dance hall girl at Bunty's...
Hey! We decide something, that's it! We're in this for the long haul, and this idea of me and Jesse's will help give us more places to hide out without worrying about some farmer with a shotgun sneakin' up on us in our sleep. We've got to think --
Another dozen out back.
What?
Great Chief of St. Louis send me.
I know it ain't no durned bank holiday!
Fine. I'll just wait here.
Well, I hope the boy pulls through. We should know in the morning.
See, that's your problem, Frank. By the time you finish figuring out stuff, I'm already finished doing it.
Looks like Web Mimms wasn't the only casualty this town's got.
"Big and older"?
Didn't think you would.  I'm going to go make the coffin.
How'd it go in there?
Gents, we are in the middle of something here.
...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
That he was.
Ma! Please!
Teasing you is completely unfair.
So you're saying I should leave you alone and go spend time with Jimmy Younger?
Little ones.
I am so sorry, Jesse.
I don't understand.
That's... wonderful. It's just... I thought...
Don't turn around.
Oh. That's nice to know.  We're going to hang you, you know.
That's what I would have done.
The railroad has no business in Tennessee. Therefore I have no interest in the state of Tennessee.
Really?
Thank you, Miss -- ?
My professional opinion is that you have managed to piss off the wrong bunch of farm boys this time.
Really!
Leaving you in charge of operations until he recovers.
Just perfect.
Parker.
What is that?
That.
It's early in the game yet, Mr. Rains. Jesse James and I are just learning how each other moves, feeling out each other's patterns.
First of all: you, shut up.  Now, you've given me a thousand miles of railroad to cover. Every time the James Gang strikes, we shift a hundred detectives to that area. But there's just too much open land, too many riverbeds to ride, caves to hide in. This gang operates across four states, often riding a hundred miles between jobs.
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Yes?
You like it there, don't you?
Courtney, you're going to have the peanut butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called it a 'playful but mysterious little dish." You'll love it. And then...the red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that'll follow nicely.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Oh Jesus. I'm going home.
Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us.  Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!
What are you doing tonight?
That's nice.
Do you want to come to my apartment or not?
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Why? What's wrong?
But what about the past? Our past?
Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman.
Listen, what about dinner?
Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it?
It was a pretty long message, wasn't it?
By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You're still seeing her, right?
Excuse me. I really must he going.
It never was supposed to he! Why isn't it possible?
Patrick? Is that you?
This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We're going to Nell's. Gwendolyn's father's buying it.  Where did you get your overnight bag?
Call me please, Patrick.
What...is...it?
Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out?
I can't believe that Price prefers McDermott's card to mine.
Yes, Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs. He's at Tunnel.
I'm leaving. I'm getting out.
And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany about?
Late?
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
I'll do it.
You don't like this, I take it?
What is it?
Who?
Yes, Patrick?
Jean?
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Yes? You're dressed...okay.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
Interesting.
Jean? What?
Patrick Bateman's office.
Patrick? Is that you?
Just...say...no!
A model? An actor?
Oh really? DAISY He said...  He said you gave him bad vibes.
You think I'm dumb, don't you?
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
So, what's the topic of discussion?
Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes.
Coffee?
KIMBALL.
Oh no, I'm okay.
Where did you go to school?
Nice. Very nice.
Pardon me, but are you okay?
Would you rather I not smoke?
Yeah...Yale thing.
So...there's nothing you can tell me about Paul Owen?
What kind of man was he? Besides...  the information you've just given.
Do you feel that way?
Where did Paul hang out?
He had a yacht?
Don't you know this?
I mean no one's dealing with the homicide squad yet or anything, right?
The earth just opens up and swallows people. 
Uh, no. There's one...down here.
Listen, if anything occurs to you, any information at all...
Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information?
No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me.
According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam.
I've questioned him.
He does? You're sure?
Listen, what's your name?
And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.
Hey, Halberstam?
I just don't see how someone, anyone, can appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be so fucking, I don't know, cool about it?
You are a fanatic.
Alice? You gotta make him do the start-up with Teddy and me.
I'm just screwed.
It's important.
When I was a kid? And he was moving us all over the place? I spent all my time writing stuff on Outpost 1.0. I thought Gary Boyd was the greatest.
If my dad'd leveled with me like that even once... The weird thing is, my fantasy he could somehow be like the old Gary? It's his fantasy, too.
C'mon, I wouldn't have a destiny without you. My destiny would be dying at 20. From eating --
What!
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Go where? You can't get away from people like this.
It's the only one with dishes on the roof. The studio's a front. That's why they keep postponing its opening.  ...gotta get in there.
I know how to get in there. But you've gotta help me.
That was -- different.
Milo?
This is the biggest Beta demo in like the history of software. You'd be my partner.
What?
What?!
Is it your software?
That's gotta kill him, right?
Milo. Surprised he's not your guest.
We could move 'em up here.
The content filer has t'be written into the media files so bits coming off the satellite can be read by multiplatforms. Really, omniplatforms. Including whatever new hardware emerges.
You really wrote this just today?
Everything I do is under scrutiny. The questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.  I'm confused. Doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?
You've been coming in early.
You could've handwritten it.
Gary, I --
This is good. Who did it?
Hasn't affected his work, though.
Help me change the Skywire settings. Add five degrees to each satellite coordinate.
Ready for number three?
I know you lost all his work. Maybe I could come down here and --
...You wanna work -- here?
Could it be a glitch? Something the construction workers caused?
Every entry was authorized.
Delbert seems to enter #21 twice. Without leaving the first time.
Get the backslash, the colon, keys kids don't use but geeks do.  What would Milo want in here, anyway?
Come with me.
Now what are we doing? I don't get any of this shit!
I'm getting a teacher's pet rep.
Me too! Were you an Army brat or something?
What've you got there?
So, when you were talking about wishing people were more like computers. Was that then? Or now?
That's great. I -- didn't know.
...Milo?
Yeah, they dig stuff like this.  "CBS News has partnered with Outpost Information Systems in a cable news network due to launch Fall of 2001."
It's how on-line services push logos they wanna sell you. You don't ask for 'em, they just appear. 'Have to work on it somewhere besides my office or my house. And then the quality of the broadcast wouldn't exactly be digital, that's 12 months away.
Gary knows I'm close on Skywire. We have to do this fast.
Oh, man. I'd have to get into Gary's house. To get the satellite positions.
I don't know --
Hardly anybody does, that's the beauty part. No cameras, the DOJ doesn't bother with it, it's accessed by a tunnel they boast about. You know the best place to hide a leaf?
Oh.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
Please don't go.
Maybe it's the satellite.
...You got my E-mail?
Is that how Larry feels?
But these, like, White Supremacists trashed my office, last week.
A beautiful geek? I don't wanna sound paranoid, or like a pig, but what're the chances?
That kid's the great white hope.
How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham?
'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food.  It just popped up to say hello, and now it's gone back down below.'
'Milk, milk, lemonade.  Round the corner fudge is made.  Stick your finger in the hole, And out comes a tootsie roll!'
I'm going to paint this can of soup and become famous and not give you any credit for it.
Just where you'd never think to look for him. We'll be there.
Thank you.
Yes?
Russian Intelligence? Are you mad?
Carnies.
I'm sorry, Basil, I thought she was a man.
I'm leaving!  Oh, and Austin?
Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger.
Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin?
Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000. I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point. You might as well surrender. Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to...
Mr. Powers, my job is to acclimate you to the Nineties. You know, a lot's changed since 1967.
My mother's told me all about you.
Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh? How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense?
You know, a Chigro... part Chinese, part Negro...  Chigro.
Brrrr! She must be frigid. There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag!  They're shag-mad, man! Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest.
Hey, who put this in here? Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine.
Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with?
Good morning, Vanessa! I hope you have on clean underwear.
Not a good time to lose one's head.
It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.
It's not what it looks like, Vanessa.  At ease, boys.
OK, Austin Danger Powers: One blue crushed-velvet suit. One frilly lace cravat. One gold medallion with peace symbol. One pair of Italian shoes. One pair of tie-dyed socks, purple. One vinyl recording album: Tom Jones, Live at Las Vegas. One Swedish-made penis enlarger pump.
One warranty card for Swedish-made penis enlarger pump, filled out by Austin Powers.
Everything seems to be in order.
Oh my God, he's back.
Shut up.
Remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?
Breathtaking, Frau. These automated strumpets are the perfect bait for the degenerate Powers.
Release the sharks!  All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. I figure every creature deserves a warm meal.
Right.
Fine. Whatever. Mutated, ill-tempered sea bass it is.  Come, let's return to dinner. Close the tank.
No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.
Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber. Project Vulcan is about to begin. Scott, are you coming?
We also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand-painted theme plates for collectors.  Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.
You didn't...
We're not yet open for business, I'm afraid.
Normally, we'd be eager to oblige --
As real as you wish. Hot or cold. Humid or dry. Anything you like. Within reason.
I want you to say the first thing that comes into your head when I say these words. Do you understand ... ?  Blue ...
Knight ...
Nature ...
Hope...
Ah, beautiful. Just as he promised.
Mrs. Peel ... Come quickly. Brolly's been betrayed! I'll tell you everything ... The weather's getting worse and worse ... they're after me ... coming for me ... come quickly!
May I help you, madam ...
Your voice -- it's so familiar ...
Congratulations, Mrs. Peel. You have been a worthy opponent. You have tracked us down. You are within an ace of winning.
Close. We're so hush-hush, even we know nothing about it.  Now let's see, there's coconut cake, date and walnut; I recommend the rum baba ...
My number two. Special assignments. She's --
Who?
For starters. Of course I had to kill the Teddy Bears, as well ...
Doctor Peel, I presume?
Red herring would have been too obvious, don't you think?
Much better.
... Showers followed by sunny periods.
That place is so absurd, so out of date ...
According to Mother, Sir August owns half of the Highlands. A millionaire. Former head of Special Projects at the Ministry. Now ...
Not so much eccentric. More barking mad. He has a wife called June. And a daughter somewhere -- Julie.
So ... I distract him while you snoop around? How?
That's possible. Sir August was convinced he'd met me before. But I'd never met him. Another odd thing. When it rained, he said it was just as someone had promised.
Elementary, Mrs. Peel. Trubshaw isn't the only shoemaker still practicing his trade ...
Not quite. This is my field.
The Prospero Project was started by my husband. It was an early attempt to solve the problems of global warming. In theory, climate engineering is entirely feasible. We thought of injecting a chemical cocktail into the atmosphere by laser and satellite. A 'quick fix'...
Exactly. There'd been earlier attempts to pump carbon dioxide into deep sea. Propane gas mostly. In small quantities it captures chlorine. Protects the ozone layer. But it proved impractical. Too bulky ...
That's what we were working on.
Three agents killed by bad weather...
Steed ... !
Was I?
And do you trust me?
You're playing games.
I'm playing to win.
Please don't tell me it's how you play the game.
Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -'
Your mission is simple. Find out how and why these agents died.
Where's Mother?
Emma in Wonderland. Welcome, Mrs. Peel.  We've been expecting you. We hope you'll enjoy your stay with us. Decontamination is almost complete.
Talk to the pipe, Mrs. Peel. That usually helps. Don't worry about me being invisible. Other than that I'm perfectly normal.
Ah, here we are. Steed asked me to play a hunch:  Valentine Peel.
Privately owned by ...
You're not venturing alone, surely.
Still doesn't. Better safe than sorry.  She was in a dangerous game, Steed. High stakes. She may prove to be a risk.  If she is, there's only one solution.  Termination.
I was hoping you could tell me.
Cocky little bastard. I hope he was a baddy.
John Steed.
I think she really likes you ... Where's Mrs. Peel?
Look at that guy. What a hunk.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
And...
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
I don't want any trouble.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Great car.
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
Yes, son, did you find out where the bachelor party is?
I know you're as unhappy as I am about Debbie's marriage to Rick.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
So, he's playing hard ball. Well, two can play that game.  Go after him. Stop at nothing. You hear me?
Cole, my God, boy, what are you doing here? What happened?
Cole?
Cole, we've got to talk.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event.  Well, what do you think?
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
That feels so great.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow...  We're going to the chapel and we're...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
I don't believe you.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Of course you do. I trusted my ex, Mel, too. Cousin, I can only talk from experience. What do you think they do at these parties, have tea and play scrabble?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Great bathing suit.
Jumbo, where the hell are the women?
Screw you... Screw that... Don't jerk me around. You promised me 1500 seats for the Police Concert... 1500, not fifteen!... Screw that... Screw you -- Screw Sting.  Hi, guys.
Wait a minute. You been living with Debbie! Why do you want to get married?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
It's true.
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
What can I be doing for you?
Not one minute longer or Milt will come for you.
You want to share it?
She hates me. It's over. You'll see, as soon as you get married, everything changes. You sure you want to go through with it, man?
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
You're all under arrest. Open up!
I'd love that.
Where'd she go?
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
I'm not really hungry.
What the hell is that?
What's this?
You're late again, Rick.
How the hell are we supposed to get this donkey inside?
Oh these moments do try me...
That's Franny. She likes firemen.
-- What the hell's the matter with you? You always check the other side. I haven't got time for bullshit right now, okay? We got a job here.
I like what you've done with the place.
In the Field Museum once.
People actually used to pay you for this?
What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
Thanks.
Jesus, it's too damn bright in here... Like a goddamn spotlight... I'm goin' blind...
That's not what it's about, Brian. The point is there was a kid in there. And what if there'd been two? I went in because that's what I do. It's my way. It's dad's way. It isn't everybody's way.
When dad died, I saw another fire...
I hate him so much sometimes, Stephen. You don't know how hard it was for me to put that uniform on...
-- Stephen, wait a minute. I gotta talk to you. It's Adcox, he's --
Don't tell them about Adcox... Don't let 'em...
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
No, he's more of a dinosaur. Guy's not a dummy, though. He's juggling alot of balls on this one.
Well, our specimen here is your basic standard issue piece of primary suppression equipment. This area is the pumping panel, which controls the rate of liquid insertion into the hose.
Brian. What's wrong?
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman.  Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
I think your boss is going to need some spin control.
Brian McCaffrey...  Oh this is really a treat. Brian McCaffrey. Lost a dad to the animal, huh?
Okay, here's the deal. I'll tell you a story, you tell me one. Fair?
Famous story even. Straight burn. Just an engine and truck first on scene. What did you feel, Brian, when you first got there?
If it was a joke, sir, you'd be laughing.
-- Shhh.
Temperature in this room was about 2000 degrees, but copper wire in outlet is melted, which requires 5000 degrees. An accidental short in the plug could of created a spark of 7000 degrees, hot enough to melt the wire and start a fire.
Read.
But he could have killed everybody there. The firebreaks kept it from spreading in the wall. The backdraft blew out the flame. That's it. That's the reason.
This is the copy of Swayzak's manning report that was released. Everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. They're all airtight.
Did you pull me out?
Did I say thanks?
Four months?
That's Sean? Jeez, he's a giant.
Completely out of control.
And just this year, "Brian's Sound Spectrum". Your own company even. Big step.
Who's going to die?
Your brother's right. If you don't fasten these correctly they could open and you'd get burned.
Firehouse.
Dad!
We gotta roll, Stevie...
Uh, Helen, I wanted to talk to you a second about Sean...
You can't talk about my brother like that...
Stephen, what are you doing here?
Oh yeah? How's he doing?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
Yeah? When was the last time?
I'm sorry... I... couldn't sleep...
Anyway, down here, take a look...
See that patch of shirt? We wondered about the discoloration so he ran a spectro. On a lucky shot we picked up some traces of Trychticholorate. Nobody around here had ever heard of it.
Probably got in Cosgrove's clothes in a gas state from the fire.
Who's this?
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
The Church is a fucking racket. I know how they operate. I've been part of the racket since the first time some faggot priest spilt water on my head. My Aunt Lu says I was crying all the way through. Yeah, I know their game inside out. Now I'm free of it and I'm gonna stay that way.
People.
Can you believe the nerve of this fucking guy? He kills people for fun, and then, he puts up 100 G to bring in some guys who raped a nun. What a sick fuck. Man...
You brought it back to the Church. And then it made it's way back to me, again.
I forgive you.
OK asshole. You owe thirty grand. Now what are you gonna do?
Fuck Strawberry. You're gonna end up owing 60 G to a homicidal maniac!
You do know that he's gonna blow up your house, kill your wife and kids --
How's the case going?
The fucking rapists, man. The punks who raped that nun. The $50,000 reward from the Church! Remember?
BLAK OUT.  BLAK LISTED.  BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
C'mon.  It's easy.  It's the same thing y'all do out at the Yankee game, no different 'cept we changing one word.  Everybody go it?
You idiot.  You almost gave me a massive coronary.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street.  You must be crazy, Julius.
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
You don't have the demographics.
We're ready when you are.
Life is beginning to look up.  It's all good in da neighborhood.
It's that bad, huh?  It's all over my face.
Please, have a seat.
Why they gotta make my nose so big?
So that's what you been doing?
Sloan and I have been looking all over for you.
Gentlemen, the show, our show will be satirical.  You know what that is, don't you?  Trust me on this one.
Hurry up, I wanna watch HBO.
We ran out without my shoes and the floor.  I gotta get my stuff.  What about our savings?
If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food?
You're now Mantan.
I'm always gonna be that.  But I ain't doing no more buck dancing.
No matter how sexist or racist the material may be?
...exactly thirty-two minutes ago.
Four minutes ago.
The middle class black family moves into a white suburban enclave.  The middle class black family moves into a small Southern town that is run by the KKK.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black father raises his teenage daughter.  The middle class single black mother raises her teenage son.  And so on and so forth.  It's too clean, too antiseptic...
What is it you want from me?  Some plantation follies?  Some sitcom that takes place on a watermelon patch?  Some show that follows four nigger generations of junkies and crackheads?  You want me to go back to the ante bellum days?
I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.
Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance?
Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky.
Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire.
We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting?
That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout. That'swhatI'mtalkin''bout!  He's off the hiz-hook!
That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything?
I don't give a good goddamn about Finland, Norway, Sweden or wherever ya blond ass came from.
Hold on a sec, I got a call.
That's what I'm askin'.
Dem white boys giving you a hard time?
The truth is never let them seeya sweat.  You do that, that's half the battle.
Three nights Charleston, South Carolina.
So he drank himself into a stuper?
So what's up with you?
Sounds risky to me.
You okay?
Same here.
Who's side are you on?
Is that good or bad?
How so?
Why'd you do that?
Dunwitty and I feel you've been getting too close to him, getting his mind all messed up.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
Hi, Mona.
I'm happy for all of us.  It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
That's the way it came out.  Let me ask you one question.  Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
You feel good, not nervous?
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
You hear me talkin' to you.  The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
How's the food?
It was.  It is.  But this is a different kind of show.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Yes, I know.  Jukka, have you ever seen a Negro person before?  Even had a real conversation with a real Negro before?
A fiasco.  A disaster.  A boondoggle. An abomination.
Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy.
Yes you!
You sing and dance?
Why do you say that?  You've never seen me.
Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.
Money and nothing else?
Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton?
Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat.
Y'know my lady Lucindy?
Too bad.  How 'bout a dress?
Mantan, way too short, too tight. Get her one of dose...
...that was Vicki, her best friend. Dat dress will cast ya round...
I heard ya lady is wild.
Around...
...then what about...
...like macaroni and cheese...
I slept too near where I fell out.
Dat's yo Uncle Ben.  That reminds me, I've seen a lot of troubles lately.
Sleep 'N Eat, I was my wife's husband and grandchild at one and the same time.  And lo' and behold, as the husband of a person's grandmother is his grandfather, I Mantan, became my own grandfather.
I feel a song a comin' on.
What else?
Oh you do, huh?
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface.  You ever heard of Bert Williams?  He was a great artist.
Why all of a sudden are you flippin' on me?  This blackface thing was part of the deal from the git-go. Don't even try to play it like you ain't a part of all this.  You down with Delacroix.
I'll be down front.  You better start putting your face on.
What?
And?
Don't try to change to the subject.
Is your mother not afraid on account of the highwayman to let one so young as you travel?
Pooh!  Pooh!  Best, you are joking.
Where's the beauty you promised me?
Good morning, Private James.  Please come in.  I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins.  He gambles a great deal, and wins.  Do you know the cards well?
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
And now you risk the same fate.  If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
Mr. O'Higgins, I cannot say how grateful I am for your timely assistance to my wife.
Whom have I been harboring in my house?  Who are you, sirrah?
Chevalier, though I cannot say how, I believe you have cheated me.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Good gracious!  What is this?
It is shameful -- infamous!  I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Ten thousand?  But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
I have no luggage.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
For whom else have you worked?
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Never.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
I feel the ribbon.
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
What, with me on the pillion?  Would you kill poor me?
Monster!  Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop.  But I'll have my revenge, I will!  Roddy, will you see me insulted?
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
Have you done, Mr. Cosgrove?
Then this must be done tomorrow.
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies.  In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality.  To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
May I be quite frank with you?
Mister Bracegirdle said to me that he had heard her ladyship lives in some fear of her life, and meditated a separation, in which case, she might later repudiate any documents signed by herself while in durance, and subject them, at any rate, to a doubtful and expensive litigation. They were quite insistent on this point, and said they must have absolute assurance of her ladyship's perfect freewill in the transaction before they would advance a shilling of their capital.
But I will have it on my birthday, won't I?
One of the boys in the stable told Nelly that you've already bought my horse, and that it's at Doolan's farm, where Mick the groom is breaking it in.  Is that true, papa?
Yes, he's fine.
In truth, sir, yes, but, if you must marry, then marry a virtuous drudge.
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then?  I have no other intentions than you had yourself.  Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily?  Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition.  I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
Yes.  He brought me in his carriage, and he will call for me at midnight.
He will believe that it will please me if he asks about it, and I shall tell him everything except some circumstances which might humiliate him.
Can I at least have a drink?
Hurricane kept you up, too?
Fuck, what the fuck is going on --
Holy fuck... Holy fuck, what the fuck did you guys do?
Some.
Well, why didn't you say so? We'll just drop all your charges, then --
You shot Childs and Nunez.
I guess Nunez wasn't dead after all. He came after us with a vengeance.  You know the rest.
I promised them I'd ask you where West and the others are...
Back up.
Where's the cabin?
Cadet, what's your name!
He wouldn't kill anybody...
Shut up.  Let me see your grenades.
Roberto, what the fuck?
Right?
Mueller.
You hated West, Mueller loved him --
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
Full clip to the body --
I... I don't know...
My father is a powerful man. Over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.  I am a homosexual.
Levi, I don't know if you're familiar with investigative work, but we have this little thing called "motive" and you just gave yourself one.
He admitted it.
Why did he come back for you?
Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer.
Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.
Dunbar will testify that you were.
No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.
He's not done by a longshot, I can get more out of him --
We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing.
Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession.
They're taking your command, aren't they?
You're a good soldier, Bill.
What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it --
Ah, Christ
Is Dunbar cute?
You guys really got the shit kicked out of you here.
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
"Too neat." How long have you been an investigator?
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy -- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried.
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
Why do you care?
I didn't shoot West...
What?
That's a fantastic idea --
I pushed him too hard.
For what?
We were close to something with Kendall.
Hardy, what are you doing --
We need to talk --
This isn't the time --
Do I have a choice in this?
What are you doing out here?
Your phone number?
They found him. Poor fucker was practically blown in half --
We just want --
He said what?
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.
Tell him to shut up --
Sign here and here.  Hey, ain't you the folks workin' on that whole hulabaloo from last night?
So?
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
You want Kendall, don't you?
Great, great. That's fantastic.
See! The big guy likes it.
Jesus, kid.  Let me guess. Real pretty, blonde hair, blue hat?
You won't find a better place!
Well, she... uh...
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
Lord, I'm sorry I...
I'll...
He was buttering her rolls. Pumping her churn. Splashing milk in her box.
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
You're just trying to get me to leave, aren't you? That's why they sent you here.
You don't like it?
Okay.
What did she say?
Having a kid changes everything. I mean, there's the diapers and the burping and the midnight feedings...
No, but I hear it's terrible. Then you spend years trying to corrupt and mislead this child, fill its head with nonsense and still it turns out perfectly fine.
People needn't worry so much. It's not my time yet. This isn't how I go.
And every day I gave him a quarter. Every day. Then I got sick and was out for a couple of weeks. And when I went back there, you know what he said?
Your mother hasn't been keeping up the pool. If you wanted to you could...
Why not religion, Dad?
Josephine actually went to the Congo last year.
Dad!
The thing about icebergs is you only see 10 percent of them. The other 90 percent is below the water where you can't see it. And that's what it is with you Dad. I'm only seeing this little bit that sticks above the water.
Dad, I'm about to have a kid of my own here. It would kill me if he went through his whole life never understanding me.
The river.
Tell me how it happens.
Let's get out of here.
I don't believe it!
This is it? The whole vault.
Are you Jenny Hill?
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
I talked with your father last night.
You never told me how your parents met.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
Is that Dr. Bennett's car?
I don't know if you've seen it, but Josephine has some photos in the most recent Newsweek.
How is that possible? I mean, you try to ask him a question and suddenly it's another one of his stories.  You can't honestly say you know him.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Mom?
Mom, do you want some time with Dad?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Do you like it?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
Yes. I know.
And...
Right.
What was that?
You must have a visa or something...
She says she has a secret to tell.
When?
What was that?
Tell me.
Do you believe in love?
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
He wants a lot of money.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
They go.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
Give me some money.
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Fine.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
No.
We'll pretend it never happened.
I don't hate you.
Sometimes which?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
What? I... I wasn't saying...
I wasn't saying anything.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
Have you had any before?
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
You can probably buy them on the flight.
Whatever.
Why?
My name's Sophia.
What are you doing?
Lazarus?
I brung you a little basket of goodies. Fresh squash, tomatoes, some okra, butter beans.
Just wanted to say how much I appreciate you helping me the other day. My niece, she's cured up, and I got you to thank.
This was very sweet of you.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
Hey.
What do you need?
Naw. They got some blue dye, though. You think them boots you got on come from a black cow?
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
Still need a lift?
Sit down, man. Need a beer?
I don't know. She's gettin' crazy, like she gets. Begged me not to go. Got real down. I just think somethin's happened. Like she run off with someone. You'd tell me if you knew somethin', right?
Uh-uh. I's hitchin' up the interstate when I seen your truck outside.
Ronnie. You can't see cuz you're too close to it.  These nervous spells you get. You never had that shit back in school...
YOU SHUT UP!
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Way I see it, it's gonna take a while for you to get right.
These men you up under. How you let them do ya like that?
You know what I'm talkin' about.  All that mess with ya teachers and... boys in the backs of trucks.
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
No, ma'am. You stop that foolishness.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Now that's sharp. That's real sharp. Miss Ella Mae set you up, didn't she? You like it?
I don't want you to let go.
Do you call it a game when only one man win each time? I think you call it a damn shame.
That ain't my scene. If that's somethin' you into...
It got some miles on it, but my boys say she run good. Got fresh 22's on her. Ain't my doin'. That's just how it came to me. Don't worry. Nobody gonna come lookin' for it. I got the pinks... got no problem.  Ain't gonna have my girl ridin' no bus.
Was that Lincoln James I seen run off?
Got no place for preachin' here. Not now. So you do as I say...
A naked woman, chained in ya house?
And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.  Who gives this girl in marriage?
Keep the change on that.
What happened in there... that won't your fault. Ain't a young man alive could keep they britches on with that girl being in heat like she is.
You a preacher?
But that's so fuckin' stupid.  I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
What?
I feel better. Do you?
Alright. How much you need, ho?
What's this?
Nick, let's go hunting.  Bag Cavello.
What are they doing now?
What are you missing?  Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
What'd you say?
Nick, have I been a good partner?
Givin' you a book is like givin' a baby a gun.
What does Ichiro mean, anyway?
Where do we start looking for this guy?
Where're you going, Ichiro?
It's Ichiro.  Ich.
You know, Inspector, you take shit once, you take shit forever.
It may be too soon to talk about it. When someone we care for dies we...  ... keep something of their's.  A tie, a pen.
You must leave?
I've continued working on the case!
Know her?
You said you could keep up with her! 'No problem, Nick-san.'
Nick...
Work, lunch, groceries, laundry... Fabulous...
Ich, my name is Nick.  Not Nicklaus, not Nicklaus-san, not Nick-san. Nick.
I want to go talk to him.
It's very small.
Nick, you can't do this.
Just one, compadre... Kampai.
Don't be an ass.
You know where I can get a decent cup of coffee this time of night? I'm buying.
I don't remember saying yes.
Might be different in New York.
Sugai won't give it to me, you know that.
I want a gun.
Hey, inspector, I don't intend to take the rap for this.
You had my help, detective.
I'm sure glad you found us, Sebastian.  What do you think, Mary?
The name is Batty.  Roy Batty.
And what can he do for you?
Because by the second day of incubation any cells that have undergone reversion mutation give rise to revertant colonies -- like rats leaving a sinking ship.  The ship sinks.
But not to last.
Not only that, but we have smiliar problems.  Accelerated decrepitude. But we don't want to die quite yet.
You could help us.
He could?
I'd be happy to mention it to him.
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
Six, huh?
You got a machine on it yet?
Look, go home.  Get some rest. Take an aspirin.
It's gotta be right for my customer.
Well, when do you get paid?
Machines can be helpful sometimes, but they can also be a pain in the ass.  Ask for a trace on a forger and you might wind up at a steel- mill.  I don't mind a bum-steer once in a while -- it's their personalities that usually get me.  Somebody once said that man makes machines in his own image.  If that's true, whoever made Esper should have been shot.
You start.
How do I stop one?
Not if it works.
Next.
But I would like to buy you drink.
Vodka!
Prosit.
How long you had these guys?
Hey, it's okay.  I like to pee. So how are you doing?
Let's hear it.
I didn't say that.  Your motivity rate checked out a little slower than last time.
During the road test...
Your mind kept wandering.  That bothered me.
But you haven't put in for emigration.
I'd like  you to take a look at these pictures.
Nothing.  She wanted to know about suck night.
Yeah?
Are you for real?
It's a good job.
The best.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
I wouldn't accept it.  Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
In a magazine you come across a full-page photo of a nude girl.
Who is this?
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Uh-huh.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
You know what I think?
Where the hell you been?
Bad?
May I ask a personal question?
Like you said, Mr. Deckard, a machine can be a hazard.  The Voight-Kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?
How many questions does it usually take, Mr. Deckard?
I kinda get nervous when I take tests.
Maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself -- who knows.  So you look down and see a tortoise.  It's crawling towards you...
I'm hungry, J.F.
Methuselah Syndrome.
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Get out of here!
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
What's wrong with you?
Right.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
Wait!  Wait!
It's Perry!
That was...wonderful!  I've never felt anything like that in my life.
Wait, Eve, please!  Wait.
I think it's the eyes.
Watching television in color.
What's fair?
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Who are these people?
Thank you.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Then forget it.
Because I want to get married.
It does?
I didn't know that.
It didn't used to be that way.
Get out!
He has a computer?
The guy with the underpants!
Yep.  You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
No it's not!
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
No!  Not crazy!
I thought I was here to meet women.
Why?!  I think she's very attractive.
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that!  Or why Cliff would say that about you.
What?
No.  I admire you.  I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you.  I did. I think that you are the most--
I'm leaving, too.
Eve?!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
I've got to go, now.
These are wonderful.
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Helen-Thomas-Webber!  Maybe we have been down here a little too long!  Please excuse her French.
But, I don't understand.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Uh-huh.
You have very nice ceilings.
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Oh, yes.  It would probably kill him.
Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.
How old are you?
The sky?  Where?
Help you?
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Dad!
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down.  But we've got to hurry.
No.
Oh, my God!
According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.
Unless we get a postcard or somethin', that's my guess.
Good god.
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
Yes, yes, the song.  So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Days??
Thirty -five years!
To go up.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
Hi, honey!
Get the presents and do the lights.
Yes, yes it is!
We stay down here.
Yes.
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
How long will you set it for this time?
What are you bitching about now?
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
Stop it, you two!
Eve!  This guy is un-be-liev-able!
I don't know.
You're serious, aren't you?
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
That water's freezing!
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
Go to the bathroom.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
Or have perfect table manners.
And if we can't find him?
What's wrong?
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock!  The clothes! The toothpaste!  The guy was on the level!  And you blew it!  A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
I'm going to need two more banana- splits and a cherry coke!
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Shit Ben! How the shit are ya?
To your health, Frank.
Frank, I have something for you. Excuse us everyone.
Detective Williams here. Yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. Yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day, when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though, I can't.
Jeffrey?
Why do you do it?
What color is it?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. Here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
Well now Jeffrey, how did you come to get so involved?
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. Hurry. I'm in the apartment. Hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Because of your information I alerted internal affairs to check out Detective Gordon. I had to keep on with him as if nothing was different. He slipped off on his own when he found out we were going to raid Frank's place.
Oh God, that stuff stinks.
NO, you come on. Take off your pants. I want to see you.
What do you want from me?
Do you like the way I feel?
Yes.
It used to make me laugh, but.
Yes. Frank--
I'm not crazy.  I know the difference between right and wrong.
What do you want to do?
That wouldn't be too good, would it?
Look, snap out of it, will ya?
Do you love me?
Dorothy. No!
Yes.
They hurt his head.
Frank gone?
Yeah, maybe so. Frank's got me, and you and really it's all thanks to Don, isn't it. Remember that. Your husband was the one who started fucking my mind with drugs.
We're looking for him. In your opinion, why did Frank kidnap Dorothy's son and husband?
Hey? You like to walk.
Jeffrey, breakfast is ready.
Thanks a lot, Mom.
No, I'm just gonna walk around.
God, you scared me.
Hello, uh, my name is Jeffrey Beaumont. Is Detective Williams in?
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
I was sorry to hear about your father. I know your mother from church. It's such a shame.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. Real good.
He comes over to study.
Please excuse me a moment, Jeffrey, and I'll get to the dishes.
Well.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
Oh yeah?
That's the building. She lives on the Seventh Floor. Don't stop to look long, the police are watching.
Did they find out anything when they questioned her?
You said it was a strange world. And you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy? She is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
It wouldn't hurt to hear the plan, I guess.
Now, we'll walk over so there's no license plates and you give me at least three minutes. I can stall if it's more, but I need time to find a good window, alright?
Are you alright?
Yes. I do.
You want a Dairy Queen?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You saw a lot in one night.
No, silly - I'm still in school you know. But I'll meet you after school and you can tell me what you've learned. You better be careful, Jeffrey.
Okay, be careful.
Oh yeah?
I can't believe what you are finding out. Are you going to continue with this. Are you going back to her apartment?
You worry about me really?
Everything okay?
Okay.
What was that all about?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
Jeffrey? What's going on?
Sandy?
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone, the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Come on out a minute, okay?
Just for him?
Up where?
Listen kid, I think you better understand who you're dealing with here.
Ah, Agent Smecker, we have a problem.
Oh, God! Don't kill me! We're on the same side! The boss musta sent you in as back up, huh? Oh, shit, please! I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man.  They call me the funny fuckin' man!
Poppa Joe said there was only two. In and out.  Boy, you guys sure did a good job. You're good, huh? Cool masks. Where'd you get them?
Climb the corporate ladder, boy. Don Rocco.
You think they sold me out? No way.
Anybody see ya?
They got nothing.
Let him go or I will deliver you, right now. 
Hello.
Mother, is that you?
How's Uncle Sibeal?
Still bickerin' over that, huh?
You guys are not under oath, here. I am assuming you knew these two guys from before, huh?
How many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb?
No fuckin' hot water man. That...
All right, love ya ma. Listen, before ya go just give us the goods, eh?
Destroy all that which is evil...
Know what we need, man?... some rope.
I don't know they just always need it.
Is that right, Rambo?
Oh, we're good man.
Where are you goin'?  Did you tell him?
Who did you kill?
So what do you think?
There he goes.  Okay, gentlemen. Are we ready to bring this man into the light? Are we ready to truly do the work of the Lord?
Now, you will receive us.
It is your evil, who will be sought by us.
I knew you two pricks would give me problems. Give me shit cause I'm a woman. I'm not gonna take your male dominance bullshit!
And it's the same story over here. Why the crossover?  Theories.
So Duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.
Jesus. I just can't think anymore. That scene over at the coffee shop today tapped me out.
These two fucking scenes are related. Too many coincidences. Same day? Five hours apart? Dead mobsters on both scenes. Now, why did he kill the bartender?
Who the...
While Greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?
What are you serious?
Hello?
Vincenzo, that fat motherfucker, Yakavetta's right hand. He's the one who set me up. Then he went around shooting his mouth off, telling everyone I was as good as dead. He goes in there every Wednesday night around 10:00, he jerks off in the same booth to the same titty dancer. Never misses.
You bet your ass he will.
Hey! We gotta talk about this early morning church shit.
We'll keep going, Roc.
Has he now?
You gonna do what I say, got it?
Don't do this my son.
I'm Rocco. I'm the funny man. Heee Hee. I'm so fuckin' funny. Hee Hee.
Tell me a joke funny man. Hee Hee.
What color hair does he have?
Making Hutch David Soul?
What does Starsky say?
Did you see what I meant about the window?
Now. One thing we need to discuss is timing. Timing is absolutely crucial. What are you doing? Anthony!
Dignan, calm down.
Is that the manager?
What about what that guy said?
You owe me fifty bucks.
Dignan, I can't get my hair cut. That's just not possible, all right?
This is Inez. Carmen. Anita.
What the fuck is going on here?
She's from Cuba.
He needs to hire an attorney.
See, now we've got a plan.
See, one day we were playing hot box over at my next door neighbor Mr. Langston's house and Anthony fell in the pool and got knocked unconscious. I had to dive in and save him.
Mr. Langston performed cardiopulmonary recitation. CPR. I've never said this before, but frankly I thought Anthony was dead. The veins in his face were all sticking out. His skin was blue. He truly did look dead.
He's gone. He stole the car.
That coward. Son of a bitch.
He went back for his brother.
So when you were saying Bob's at the store and acting real surprised, that was just an act. You were just --
Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
I have an idea for that.
Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she?  Doesn't she?
She doesn't need to know.
Our money situation is not good.
Sixteen dollars.
He doesn't want to fight.
No fighting. It wasn't Bob's fault.
I don't want to be too much of a liability.
He was a nice guy.
I've got a great view up here. I can see all the --
What's happening? What's going on?
Where's Kumar?
Come on.
Dignan, it's too late.
How big is it?
Where?
So how is it in there? 
This is my business manager, Rowboat.
That's a sharp jacket.
Look at that woman. She's what? Fifty? Fifty-five? But she hasn't let herself go. I appreciate an older woman who has a commitment to her body.
I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
But you're thieves. It's what you are.
See you.
You think he got my license plates?
Anthony, I --
You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
At first they were going to charge me with manslaughter. That's partly why I was in custody so long. Sixty days.
Yeah. One minute you're studying Great Expectations and the next minute you're drawing the Holy Mary for some kid who tried to stab his girlfriend.
Was Future Man adopted?
No, I know. I'm just saying. I feel fine. You want a piece of cake?
Let me see it.  Did you drop it?
Yeah.
It's in the driveway.
We might have to take that chance. Cause I feel pretty strongly about this.
You don't celebrate til it's over.
Dignan and Anthony, this is Little Richard. He's crazy. Totally nuts.
I'm not allowed to drive those.
How much could you grow? Realistically.
If it's that easy why doesn't everybody grow them?
Don't you guys tell anybody about my plants.
The guy is fucking insane.
I know that now. He's a fucking psycho.
I paid for it.
How much is there?
You really think he'll remember you?
I mean, Jesus Christ, Bob. You didn't have some vicious lunatic screaming, "I'm going to remember you!"
Way to go, Bob!
I'm sure he did. We'll have to get new plates.
Bob. Are you coming?
I don't think they can make it stick, Bob. I mean, what do they actually have on Future Man?
That could be anybody's.
So tell them the truth. What do you use it for?
What do you mean get back?
Dignan. You're going to give me those keys or you're going to get hurt.
You've got a beautiful walk, Bob.
It wasn't your fault, Bob. You had your brother.
Come on, Bob.
I know, Bob. You were on a secret mission.
Dignan. Good to see you. Good to see you Applejack.  Who are you?
What's the story?
I'll say. You killed his goddam girlfriend instead. Now they're onto Neski. They're at the Brecker Hotel even as we speak.
No. The files are spotless. Whatever they find, it's just going to make Conklin look worse.
Treadstone.
Let's talk about Conklin.
...Ivan Mevedev -- senior financial manager -- worked for one of the new Russian petroleum companies, Pecos Oil. He claimed to know where the money landed. We believe this could have only happened with help from someone inside the Agency... This...
Sorry to wake you.
Sir...
I would want to know.  I would want to know that my mother didn't kill my father. I would want to know that she didn't kill herself.
That's not what happened to your parents.
It doesn't matter. Your life is hard enough.
You know I'm not.
Front. Use your teeth.
You still should've moved.
Try again.
You're sure?  We should still -- we should write it down.
-- it hasn't been two years --
We write them down because sooner or later you're going to remember something good.
It's just a nightmare.
No... How?
But we were so careful.
Where --
Switch! You drive!
I'm going to bail on the other side and wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.
If he crosses the bridge, it is.
I love you, too.
You hear me? I believed you.
Why is she trying to kill me?
A Russian?
So when was I here?
That's a lie!
We need to get in there.
-- so there were two of these explosive charges placed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerprint...  That's from the one that didn't go off.
There's only a Consulate, they sent a field officer out half an hour ago --
-- go -- take the van! --
Maybe he just needed a place to spend the night?
Alright... take it down.
-- who? -- who else is here? --
I'm here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We understand you're using the full allocation for this buy?
Still...
Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you selling?
Amnesia?
Are you an expert in amnesia?
Believed what?
You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?
Some women like Dobermans --
I don't think we need to keep looking for him anyway.
Black coat, possibly leather. Dark slacks. Dark t-shirt.  He says they're gonna try and corral the guests on the street over there, and then check them out, but...
We're looking at all Berlin outbound. Good news is, every train station in Berlin has thirty to forty fixed, digital security cameras. Common feed.
What it means in England -- and in Scotland too -- is that rebels have forfeited their lands. We were ambushed last night. But the Scots dragged their dead away.
Did the priest say anything about the Resurrection? Or was it all about Judgment?
Sir William. We come to seek a meeting.
An oath to a liar is no oath at all. An oath to a patriot is a vow indeed. Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.
I will meet you, but only one way -- if Robert the Bruce is there, and puts his hand on my Bible, and swears his loyalty to Scotland.
Longshanks promised!
Scottish rebels have routed Lord Bottoms!
While I am in France fighting to expand your future kingdom I learn that Stirling castle is lost, our entire northern army wiped out! And you have done nothing?!
Now, my flower, do you understand?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
The Bruce is not coming, William.
Thanks for the food and drink. And for bringing 'em yourselves.
Keep these. We're going too.
Wanna stay with me tonight?
Excellent! Stephen is my name. I'm the most wanted man on the Emerald Isle. Except I'm not on the Emerald Isle of course, more's the pity.
We must run in different directions!
-- while many who serve him have taken and broken his oath many times. I cannot commit treason, if I have never been his subject!
When the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. Scotland is in chaos. Your husband is secretly sending an army north.
Last night I slept with a member of the War Council.
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
No. But from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. Its nobles share allegiance with England and its clans war with each other. If you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.
I thought I was dead when ya pulled that dagger!
Plenty. Who knows? Maybe he's got severe coping problems about not having a father. Did you say the last blackout occurred when he was with his friend's dad.
It's worth a shot. I can arrange a controlled meeting. A careful dose of sedatives for Jason, some security, you and I monitoring. Evan comes in for a quick visit and with any luck, no more missing father complex.
All the dads are gonna be there.
I don't like this place, Mom. It's creepy. Please can we go? I promise I won't make any more bad pictures!
These'll bring you luck, Crockett.
I don't know... I don't remember.
I... I blacked out.
Did Da -- Jason --- get good grades?
Why do you ask?
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
I don't know. These things take time.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Best not bitch up. Wind up someone's luggage that way.
You're religious Carlos, you believe that bit about "the Lord works in mysterious ways?"
Because I think he sent me to your cell on purpose. For you to help me.
Are you hurting her?
You remind me of your father. He always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.
Get out. Both of you.
I can't believe Tommy's still pissed at me. He knows I'm moving away, right?
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
What's happened to you?
Because you're... different.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
I just thought you should know.
Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us?
I don't get it.
Let's just say you're being closely watched, George. Your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat Kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. Sound okay to you, Papa?
That's dangerous! You could blow your hands off!
You can't play God, son. It must end with me. Just by being here, you may be killing your mother.
Thanks. Wow. Hey, I want to do something really special for Kayleigh tomorrow. If I said I needed some help from you and the brothers...
Just don't drop the ball, okay?
Most guys tuck their porn under here, but all you have are... comp books.
Freeze! No "worm-boy". No "Mr. Worm," and no "Worm-Master-General!" Once you get a nickname like that you can't shake it. And I don't want everyone thinking I've got tapeworms coming out of my ass or something, okay?
Can... can... Can I have this?
I couldn't cut the rope.
Uh, we should be getting to class now.
Hey, what'd you do that for?
What the hell are you doing?
No one thinks you're a piece of shit, Tommy.
Lung cancer?
Mom. Don't cry. I can change this.
Just get out, didja?
What did I say about mentioning that bitch?
Shut up, Tommy!
Maybe it went out. Should someone check it?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
Does he know that?
Nobody ever loved me that much.
You want my advice?
You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
Goodnight.
But Sacha always puts out that light --
I'd better be going.
You haven't heard my offer.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
Rick?
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
I didn't count the days.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
Put them on the table.
But Richard, no, I, I --
Where is Rick?
This time they really mean to stop me.
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
Yes?
Ask me?
Ilsa, I --
No, Victor, there isn't.
Good evening.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
I beg your pardon?
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
But we made a deal.
No, Captain, please.
My bill.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
For the time being.
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
I was misinformed.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
Oh, no, Rick never --
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I have the letters right here.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
Uh huh.
Will I see you tonight?
Rick, I'm sick and tired of having you --
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
Are my eyes really brown?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
He'll double what I pay you.
No. Not me, boss.
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
It's bad.
No more water, you said.
Get water!
You fucking bleeding heart, you kill or you die.
Look, just slip off the raft.  The ocean would feel so good, the water's so soft and warm.  Take a little swim.  Sleep.
Use the sail for a sea anchor and you won't move.
You know, Wilson, every now and then we should say thank you.  Thank you God.
It's real.
Well, I have to say, I'm impressed.  You never gave up.
Want to come in?  Get dry for a minute.
No.  that was the last one.
Your eyes are puffy.  Did you take Valium again?
Got to follow the paper path here.
Hey, look at you.
I have to go.  I'm on call for overflow down at the Hub.
That's your dog.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
When's the next Jumbo?
Sorry...sorry... Why do my joints still ache?
Need some help?
You're Chuck Noland.
Bless us O Lord, and these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thou bounty, through Christ the Lord.  Amen.
Really?
It seemed like she had such a good time last time.
Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
When'd you start working here?
Talk is cheap.  Are we on or not?
You're fucking dead!
When I first showed up, I thought you'd lost your fucking marbles.
You've been over the line and you came back.  You've been saved, hallelujah!
As it happens, I'm headed for Frisco myself.
He *sniffs* that ether! I've seen him do it!
What'd she die of?
What are you going to tell the little ones?
It's time somebody ate *them*.
It's gettin' late. I think I'll pack it in.
How many months are you?
Oh...
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
A movie *outside*?
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
But you looked as if you liked it.
What's the *medical* explanation?
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
I know.  Is *that* nothing.
Stop it! Just cut it out!
I *helped* you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly *need* you...
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
Is *your* father dead?
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
Did you bite it?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
What kind of plane are you flying?
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Where are you going?
No, I'm not. I need a job.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering...  Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
I'm stayin', Homer.
First pregnancy?
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
I am not a doctor.
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
Rose Rose?
Shit. We don't know what he is.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
Then it's malaria?
*What* view?
I told him that you all is sick.
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
My name's Grant. Grant Ashby.
Here's where a little research comes in handy. Corporate banks give out VP titles like calendars. It's a small lie, but now we're sure he's playing.
That's right. And tech firms... They 'tend to scare people off.
Banks need to know how they're going to get their money back.
Then there it is. Ashby gets the itch.
Hey, Jake... When am I gonna get to play the Inside?
So how'd you get caught?
He's just as crooked as the next guy. You'd think he'd have more important things to do with tax payer dollars.
What are you? New? Let me tell you how good this guy is. Last night, Al calls this bookie to settle up. Apparently he's been ducking him for like a month. So the guy asks him where he's got all this money all of a sudden, right? What does Al do? Does he tell him that he cashed in a fucking Bar Mitzvah bond? Does he tell him he's been giving head out back for twenty bucks a pop? No... He starts going on about this job he just pulled and how he fleeced some Wall Street asshole-type... How HE fleeced.
Poor bastard never knew what hit him. Jesus, I almost felt sorry for the guy.
You know what we're doing with the money.
We only owe the King a hundred and fifty.
She got one leg out from under him. Now we had to lean.
We're going to make it back, Grant. Three or four times over.
You'll be there?
Then he had to bang it out across the street at the Bank of the Caymens...
Grifter huh? Where have you been on the grift? Couldn't been here long 'cause I would have heard of you, Skippy.
Minus one.
I guess it lacks a certain style.
That tip not work-out for you fellas?
I don't know what you're into with the King Pin, but whatever it is we get a piece, understand? We get a big piece. If we find out you're keeping us out, I may suddenly develop a conscious and give you up to Moonan myself. Say something stupid if we got a deal, Jake.
Sorry, I --
I lost my head. I'm... Sorry. I don't know what happened.
That's not --
Sorry about your wallet, but if you think I'm going to suck dick over thirty seven dollars, a maxed out Visa and a bad fake I.D., you're fucking crazy.  Jake.
Says who?
Alright! Hold up. You win. You got the job.
We had to see what your deal was. I'm just a little superstitious.
Mr. King, I think --
You need to get a haircut.
We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
I don't trust anyone.
Uh... Everything okay?
I think you'd do it for free. You're almost drooling. You like the rush.
I'm your basic underachiever. Can't stand working and porn doesn't seem like a good option.
He was looking out for you.
No. You trusted him... You were just getting square.
Everyone's working an angle, right?
What about...
Stop waving that thing around.
It's bad luck.
Meet me at my place later.
What you're looking for in a mark is someone who's weakness you can exploit.
What do we do? We change the scam?
Feeling lucky today, Miles. Found a penny -- Heads up. There was an empty cab right outside my building. We hit every green light.
King ain't gonna like this.
Exactly. 'Cept this Gillette guy. He gets to walk around in three piece suits, hob knob with the Mayor, own a bank, that kinda shit. Meanwhile, the King sits holed up in the steam, afraid to even take a leak without me or Harlin watching the door.
So that's it, huh? You get the cops to give you a safe ride.
He's wheeling around two million dollars in cash and he wants to stop to use the bathroom. You believe this?
What happened?
Hey, I been on the ramp all my life, so I got no problem with the way you help yourself, Jake.
So what do you want?
Coupla things. They got this Fed looking around and the girl just split.
Like we told you before, we think he's into something with the King Pin --
You help me catch him. Whatever he's into next, I want you to be into. And what you're into, I'm into. If it all goes well, those two guys from IAD will never have to hear this tape. I'll clear you guys of anything you've ever done with Vig under the guise of some cross- departmental investigation. This prick's been on the wish list for so long, you'll probably get gold shields out of it.
You sell it.
I hate cheats.
What kind of deal you looking to?
Is that your idea of arithmetic?
I get it.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
You really are a beautiful woman.
Are you trying to read my palm?
I loved it blond.
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Without hope there's no point to anything.
What?
Nothing about you.
Yes, I know that.
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.  I must go. Let me pay for this.
Toss you for it.
Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.
Which side do you like?
I'm in trouble.
I owe a lot of money.
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
I want you to forget what I said.
Would you like a drink?
Hello...
Jani! Where are you?
Ross.
Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
Where do you live, Jack?
So how do you feel, your first night? I'll bet you're on a high.
Coming up to two years now.  But I was away for six months.
I'll lay you five to one you won't sleep. In this job you have to unwind. Otherwise it'll kill you. I mean that.
That Greek guy who won at the end. You paid him out in 25s not 20s.
Does Bella come here?
What happened to Bella?
You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
Why four? And not three or five?
Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
How many aces are left?
I make it six.
You want me to check?
Next point. Friendships between croupiers inside or outside the casino are discouraged. Relationships with females working here are expressly forbidden.
This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
Thanks for the information.
Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected to mass critical.
I'm getting this flickering light on one of my panels.
The key!
It didn't go off.
Pinback, I have a computer reading of nine five seven seven.
Well... now what? What do, you have for us now. Boiler?
Find me something, I don't care where it is.
Remember what we found? Fourteen light years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?
One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb, have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?
You won't consider another course of action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm you?
Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm yourself. This is an order.
Well of course I exist.
Exactly.
Well then, you've already admitted that you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.
So you have no absolute proof that Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.
That's all beside the point. The concepts are valid, wherever they originate.
So if you detonate in...
Pinback...
Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.
Yes.
Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red dwarf.
What are you gonna name it?
The new star. What are you gonna name it?
Hey, Doolittle, think we'll ever find real intelligent life out there?
TALBY!
Must get lonely being up here so much.
Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of 'em.
What happened, Doolittle?
I'm going into them, I'm going to hit them. Doolittle...
What's that, sir?
Yes sir. Negative effect.
Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a minute.
Commander? Are you still there?
But see tonight wives and girlfriends aren't invited.
Mr. Sonrisa saw you on the cameras.  He wants you to come see him.
Look, that thing about the pliers, I was just doing what the man pays me to do. Ya know?  Comin' off hard.
This is what your life's worth, Bruno.
Some of us are trying to sleep.
Move it.
But I'm afraid of--
What're you lookin' at me for?  I'm not his next of kin.  Anyway, I don't got that kind of cash lyin' around.
Which means I gotta fence it for two. Who's got that kinda scrilla lying around, these being the worst of the times.
What's with you?  Every week this scumbag puts the squeeze on us and every week you roll out the welcome wagon like he's family.
Damn... Are you alright?
What else can we do?
Look, we gotta keep the momentum up here, not give her a chance to think.  If she hears her kid's voice...
Goodnight Bears.  Goodnight chairs. Goodnight kittens.  Goodnight mittens. Goodnight clocks.  And goodnight socks. Goodnight little house.  And goodnight--
Because we can't.  There's nothing here for us anymore.
Don't worry, I'm coming to get you.
So, what, you liked it because it was shiny?
Am I s'posed to be flattered by all the attention?
So now you tracked me down.  What d'ya think?
So what are you gonna do about it?
I haven't been able to get you off my mind.
We got separated right away.  I never knew how many made it.
Yeah, I catch your hacks.  He's Satan's lap dog, or something.
See you're back and still rocking the boat.
It turned up on the black market.  One of my sources thought I might be interested.
But she does work here?
And so should you.  Sketchy told me I could expect a visit from you.  I know all about how you threatened him.  That if he didn't break it off with me, you'd save him the trouble.
Well, it's over between you and him. We're getting married next month.
Big part of loving someone's being able to forgive them.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
Say the words, "I understand."
What about the other kids?  You get anything on them?
At least he didn't swing with your ride.
Only one I can think of.
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Yeah, I can see to it your winning streak continues.
Right after you change your wardrobe, your personality and drop about thirty pounds.
So, how do you get the woman to come to me?
Make the call.
Playing hooky again?
Don't believe everything you hear on TV.
You left out condescending.
Here it comes.  The part where the guy turns everything around.
Fight fire with fire.  Threaten to go to her husband.
But you explain that you're a compassionate and understanding person who can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Max, what did I do to deserve a friend like you?
You rock, Max.  You... Rock...
No, I'm serious.  That psycho got exactly what she deserved... Yes.
She was the one--
True, but--
That was extreme!  Did you see that one guy--
This is a hot run.  Beat it.  You're late.
And Theo can't pick up his own check because?...
For a change.
You tell Theo he's not in tomorrow he can start looking for another job.
Hot run to 842 Beulah, corner of Haight... And you can tell your pal Theo he just got his worthless ass fired. Not that he cares but the wife and kid might.
Thanks, miss.
No, I mean... you love your son?
Whoa... she is a killer.
Oh, Dicky, I c-c-can't...
No problem.
We've got to take this slow...
What was that D.J.'s name again?
Whoa... she just farted.
But... but, St. Bernard's is way the hell over in the next county!
Now, how are we gonna do this?
We got you a change of duds when we picked up the car.
Jeezis, Hawk, can you at least keep it within twenty miles of the speed limit?
Do you realize the sheer, goddamn, unadulterated, undiluted, no holds barred, one hundred percent pure as Ivory Snow, absolutely friggin' STUPIDITY of what you just did?
Dude, this is all I got.
Don't you think we should at least pull over and offer to clean it off?
Oh, I'm sorry, Trip. What you made was a big, brainless, pile of horse shit. No offense.
Jeremiah, what are you doing?
But, mom!
Someday you'll have a son just like you, Jeremiah. A boy who lies through his teeth, buys demonic records, and smokes the dope just like you.
Well? Continue! Continue!
Tell you what. You keep guessing and I'll say something when you get it.
Poor, Jam, man. Imagine having to stash your KISS records inside Carly Simon album covers. No question, Mrs. Bruce is a psycho-bitch from hell.
I knew it! I knew this was gonna happen! I had a bad feeling since last night. Remember? We are so totally fucked!
Oh, everything's hunky-dory now that the shit hit the fan just like you said it would, you snug sonofabitch! You fuckin' jinxed us!
Simplicity, Hawk.
About fuckin' time if you ask me. I'm just going through the motions till I drop out anyway.
Really, Trip, can we bore holes in your head and use it as a bong so it actually does us some good for a change?
Look, you can have my wallet...
Gimme your gun, boy!
Don't tempt me, I'll shoot!
I did?
Yeeeehaaawww!! This is totally fuckin' curly, man! Thank you God!
So... according to Hawking... wormholes might be able to provide a short cut for jumping between two distant regions of space-time.
A wormhole with an Einstein-Rosen bridge, which is, theoretically... a wormhole in space controlled by man.
When can I squeeze one out?
What happens if you tell Mom and Dad about this, Samantha?
Why did you make me flood the school?
Who is... we?
Where did you come from?
Why are you wearing that stupid man suit?
What happened to your eye?
Why do they call you Frank?
My dad said he found you on the golf course. Are you sleepwalking again?
Wanna walk me home?
Wow. Did he go to jail?
The best thing about soap is that it's the only thing on earth that can never get dirty. No matter what crap you throw on it... it always rubs off. And there it is again... perfect.
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
What happened to your neck?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
That's alright... I understand.
They suspended me for two days.
Yeah. So the idea is that... you buy these glasses for your infant, and they wear them at night when they sleep.
What? How long was I asleep?
My mom is gone.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
What?
Is that a cellar door?
I'm sorry, Ms. Farmer, I just don't get this.
People aren't that simple.
I have to take the girls to Los Angeles tomorrow.
If I'm lucky.  So... I won't be back until the first. Your dad will be back on Sunday, so I've put Elizabeth in charge until then. She has the car... so she can drive you to your therapy tomorrow.
No... apparently they can't tell us what happened yet. Something about a matching serial number that got burned.  But I had to sign a form saying I wouldn't talk to anyone about it.
Frank... instructed you... to get out of bed... just before this happened.
What else do you think about during school?
What about your family, Donnie?
Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
Yeah... you know...  Fucking.
So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
Regret.
I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
Where are we going, Donald?
No I don't.  She worries about you.
It's not that. I mean mouthing off to your teachers. I'll admit... when Dad told me what you said to Ms. Farmer, I laughed my ass off.
Gerald.
Has your son ever told you about Frank?
If that's what you think is necessary.
Our son just called me a bitch.
I haven't been accepted yet, mother.
No. I took a year off to be with you.  Of course I care. Don't get angry.  What?
I didn't realise it was such a big deal.
How did this happen?
Rose... I have to appear at his arraignment tomorrow morning. And as you know, the girls also leave for Los Angeles tomorrow morning. Now, as their coach... I was the obvious choice to chaperone them on the trip.
And how do they do this? They FLOOD the house... by breaking through the water main!
Wicked.
Where is she?!
You're what?!
So, what do I say?
Oh my God. I'm so dead...
I'll be stayin' overnight at... The Airport Howard Johnsons!
I just, I just can't believe it. I'm Minnesota's American Teen Princess!
I'm lucky I have an after-school job where I can practice my talent.
Go on! Get out!
Uh, Amber? We're not puttin' on our Talent costumes. You need to put on your "Physical Fitness" outfit. And let's shake a leg, ladies.
What're you doin' here?
If you want seconds, then I'll make sure it's hot enough for ya.
Here, I didn't get any.
And the bite marks on my ears?
Well, uh, I'm cuttin' out early today to do a little duck huntin'... but, uh, maybe I could call you tonight.
What do you mean, they take out her butt?
It's just the guys that are... you know, makin' the movie about the pageant. I told you about 'em.
We was robbed.
Annette, just use your hand.
C'mon, Rebecca, you wanted it. Now get up there. Ride it side-saddle if you have to -- like a horse. C'mon, now.
Okay?
And the year before that?
Can you remember the theme of your favorite pageant?
Yah -- yah. Everyone says this is a big accident? She got iced because she wins everything, and this time someone didn't want her to win.
Yah -- she's damn near as good as that little black fella -- with the glass eye.
Hey! Turn that float around. You think a swan's gonna swim ass first up Main Street?
...that filth is better left in the "Sin Cities."
...Today's "To Do" list includes a trip to the Mall of America. We need outfits for the "Physical Fitness" number --
Oh, there's a parking space over there. Oh, no, that's just a compact. Sorry.
What!
Close up shop. Close up shop, Hank.
Excuse me, Father, Mother, when are we moving back to Tokyo? I can't stand this place anymore. They put butter on everything.
Oh, I almost forgot...  I got my acceptance to Tokyo University.
Now we're on the right track... Put back "dear"... How does it read?
You haven't been still a moment since you've been here.  You act as if you had neurosis --
Hey you!!
Oh, no -- nothing doing.  I had a brother who was a vice-president once and that's the last we ever heard of him.
I don't wanna stick out my tongue.
Look, I'm a very nervous man.  I gotta have a job where I come to work at eleven -- go to lunch at twelve -- and quit at one.  And twice a year I gotta have a six month vacation.
You know, I'd be lost without a telephone.  Now - where were we? Oh, yes - I just made you Secretary of War.  The first thing you do is buy ammunition -- you buy it from me and I get 10% commission.
Wait a minute.  What kind of an army do you think we oughtta have?
You no gotta no gun.
That's not fair -- we've only got fifty thousand.
So! -- He's on your side, too.
How'm I doing, boss?
Chicolini, you've come just in time. We need a man who's fearless, brave. A man who's willing to die, if necessary.
We're not allowed to tell a dirty joke HAIL, HAIL, FREEDONIA
Are you sure you're not tired?
That's what you think.
Then it's war?
What I called you...  Why, what did I call you?
Oh, won't you reconsider...
Well -- they might come better but they don't come any bigger... and the bigger the better.  The bigger the betta you've got on a horse, the more you lose, and speaking about horses, why don't you marry me. Come, come -- say yes and you'll never see me again.  I'll go 'way if it means your happiness...
Gloria -- may I call you Gloria?
I -- I may be wrong, but I suspect the Secretary of War.
I said - I suspect the Secretary of War.
Oh.  Then there his somebody else?
Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!
I shall report this indignity the my President.  Mrs. Teasdale,  I feel this regrettable occurrence will plunge our countries into war.
Uncle, you can't do this!
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
He's doing it to spite me, I tell you, and it's got to stop!
He was fine when he left here, and now look at him.
Now I think we really do understand one another.
A hospital is no place for secrecy, Mr. Treves. Doctors spiriting hooded figures about are liable to cause comment. Why wasn't this patient properly admitted, and why is he in isolation? Is he contagious?
...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
Excellent. We shall present them, along with the other particulars of the case to the committee. I want them to see, exactly, how horribly his body has been affected. You and I shall vouch for his inner qualities.
...I... everyone has been very kind to me.
What is it, Treves?
I say Freddie, what are you about?
Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
You never mentioned his mental state.
What say you, fair one? That the tongues of men are full of deceits?
Good day...!
Alas, no.
Well it is a miracle he ever got back. And, I'm sure, Mr. Treves, under your expert care, he'll have many happy years ahead.
Is he... dying then?
Feeling better now, Mr. Merrick?
Good morning, Mr. Merrick.
What? Oh! I see! It's St. Phillips. Oh, of course. Why... why that's very good, I mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.
The... oh, the spire! How silly of me, it's as plain as day... Mr. Merrick, where did you learn to do this?
Yyess.
Yes!
Yes.
My... name is...
Merrick...
Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?
Righteousness for his namesake.
Good evening. How are you feeling?
How long will I stay here?
Ohhh...
The children! May I see?
Would you... would you like to see my mother?
Good morning, John.
...my... home?
Yes John?
The workhouse.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Very smart indeed.
Well...
YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
Pardon me?
It's your fantasy...
It's sinking! Hy-Brasil is sinking!
Those things in your hands.
Have you ever felt like this about anyone else?
The Cloak Invisible. It was my mother's parting gift.
No!
But you don't realize....
I don't want to live WITHOUT you.
Have you ever seen the sun, Erik?
Really.
I'll tell you what...
It's all part of our safety regulations. You see if someone were to get hurt they might get angry and then... well...
Because that's how he makes his money, by war and plunder!
Is there something the matter with it?
I'll kill you if you say anything about this to anyone.
About NOT raping you...
You told them I raped you -- why?
Why should you care?
It's Halfdan the Black!
Erik! Row! What are you doing?
I... I... KILLED her...
I want to die...  No, I don't!
SHUT UP!
It's magic.
You must help us.
Erik the Viking! The things you seek are not in our power. We don't make men love each other or hate each other.
You mean we'd be dead?
It's SO nice to feel wanted.
Row!
I think we should go...
Bjorn's not. He could have Bjorn's place.
So Halfdan the Black's using magic, is he? Well, I have a magic to match his! 
What are you talking about, Erik?
We must blow the first note... he note that will take us to Asgaard...
Bye, Leif.
How did he do that?
Quite... MY lord... said: "The Prayer of Faith shall have the sick."
Are you all right?
You don't need to feel bad about being sea-sick, you know.
Is it sort of... like a sinking feeling in your stomach?
For your own sake... For the others... I...
Well! Come on!
Who's that?
What?
Get away, Snorri.
You must only let the red rage take hold of you in the thick of battle.
There! THAT'S a true Berserk.
And something to sharpen them with?
And keep your sword greased.
I don't know, honey. It's horrible.
Yeah.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
Yeah, you told me that later.
I'm sorry.
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
I don't have one.
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
You like that?
Well, I should probably get going.
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Tomorrow?
Let me drive you home.
Oh shit. I remember this.  Want to go?
What?!
Oh, thank God. It's going.
More?
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
What if you hide me?
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Probably.
You know what I did.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
You mean, like...  Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
What if you stay this time?
Bye, Joel.
When?
Listen, did you want to make love?
Have sex. Y'know --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
What took you so long?
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
I should maybe talk to you.
Clementine.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
What? What do you mean?
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
How was it?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Oh, hey, Patrick.
Boo.
Stan... c'mon...
I know what it is.
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Mary...
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
What, Howard?
Stan? What's going on?
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
This book -- It's essential that people read it because --  -- It's the truth. And only I know it.
It's an apartment.
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
What's your bartlett's?
Hold on. Let me ask my friend.  Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
What was that?
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe....  ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
What do you believe in then?
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
Where do you live, Miss Hankshaw?
No, I guess not.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
But I don't want you to leave. Please stay. We can go to dinner. I owe you a dinner. And tonight... we can... really make love.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
I can see why they sent you along.
...do you copy?
Holy shit...
We have a man down...
We'll have to re-route through the port conduit to the APU.
I don't know what happened to Justin.
Carbon dioxide poisoning produces hallucinations, impaired judgement...
They thought it said, "Liberatis me," "Save me," but it's not "me." It's "tutemet:" "Save yourself."
Do you hear it? Right there.
Please... kill...
What's happening...?
Intubate, pure oxygen feed, get the nitrogen out of his blood...
You wanted to see me, Admiral?
It's not that simple.  Lyle, play the recording for Dr. Weir.
He doesn't belong on this mission. Responsible or not, he blames himself. He's too close to it.  And then there's his wife.
What does?
...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.  It's called a gravity drive.
This is Weir.
That means they didn't abandon ship.
Can anybody hear me...
I can run the image through a series of filters, try to clean it up.
That's a negative, Starck.
Dr. Weir, I need you on the bridge.
I can see that, what're they for?
Any survivors?
Hold on, what's this "gravitational distortion?"
If it worked.
What about it?
We don't get the power back, our air's gonna go bad.
"...to rescue the crew and salvage the ship." The crew is dead, Dr. Weir. This ship killed them. And now it's killing us.
I'm not asking you to believe me. You'll see for yourself... and so will your crew. You're all coming with me.
We're all on edge, Smith. We're a long way out...
Put it through TACS. Smith, you up for a flyby?
Captain Miller...
Sir.
Thank you.
Now what?
Ion drive will engage in... T-minus ten minutes.
Starck, why aren't you on the bridge?
The Event Horizon sensors show the same thing: "Bio-readings of indeterminate origin." Right before that wave hit the Clark, there was some kind of surge, right off the scale, but now it's back to its previous levels.
What's the point? I'll just get the same thing...
Who?
Go ahead.
Miller, come in...
What?
I'm on my way, Starck.
Tuck yourself into a crouched position, shut your eyes as tight as you can!
Weir can't be alive.
BLOW THE FUCKER UP.
First time in a grav couch?
Don't worry about it. He's hard, but he's fair. You're lucky to be shipping out with him. He's one of the few Captains in the service with experience in the Outer Reach.
About an hour ago. In medical. I saw my son. He was lying on one of the examination tables and his legs were... 
There's no one in the corridor but us.
We have to do something, oh God...
Jesus, that is one big ugly fat fucker...
What?
Range 500 meters and holding. Turbulence is dropping off...
What happened to his eyes?
Why Dr. Weir, I think you're in love.
What are you doing?
In our current environment, Dr. Weir, self-control is an asset.
We're going to have to work on your touch.
We can monitor the cloud's approach and observe the tests from here.
He didn't.
He didn't mean it. You know Johnny. He's always been a hothead --
Where is Reed?
Ben?
Oh my G-g-g. What did you... do to Ben?
Good thing it ain't workin... Reed, what are we doing here? This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science --
Can't do it. I cannot do it.
The shields on the station should protect us.
How long was I out?
You go through something like this, makes you appreciate having the right woman in your life.
Glad "nothing" could take you away from your work.
Reed?... Sue?
They said that's not such a good idea, the shock alone could --
I mean, you feel a little feverish.
Me like-y.
Oh, you dawg you. Better not be my nurse!
You need to control yourself and think before you --
Wait. You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
You're really cramping my style here.
You two need a time-out.
I'm sorry, sis, for leaving you guys --
They're ready for you, sir.
Reed's disaster. You know, I half- think he did this to me on purpose.
Get me on the AM shows, Larry King, cover of the Journal...  I've got to do something about this scar. Make sure they only shoot my right side.
Sir, I've always wondered... Why Sue? You could have any woman in the world but --
You're, you've, I mean, how have you bee--
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Feeling better?
Uh, Sue...? I can't.
What?
Okay. Is there any way to duplicate that feeling? Some memory or...
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that... You must think that was some kind of latent hostility or --
But we're the focus, right Reed? Reed...?
And you sure you can control this thing? Last time didn't work out so well.
Reed. How close are we to a cure?
The power... I need... more power... to control... the storm --
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
Ben did this?
But I'm not done with the machine --
Victor, your scar --
If you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job --
Reed's gonna fix me up --
Oh, man, if you could swing something there, I'd do anything for you. I want to work with you guys.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Something happened to them, mon.
On the ledge?
I take out the garbage.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Are you still a virgin?
Does Mom know you have company?
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
Any problems?
Did you throw away those fries, Hamilton?
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
Do you have any ice tea?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Oh. Hi.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
Knock it off, Damone. I need real help.
Yo.
I hear you brought a film clip with you. Do you want to set it up for us?
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
We just missed the turnoff to the party.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
Was it great?
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Sometime?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
You just ripped my card in two!
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
You look like you could still be in high school.
Thanks for picking me up.
Where do you feel like going?
It's very warm out tonight.
Do you know what you want?
Do you mind if I excuse myself for a moment?
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
Where's Mike today?
John Bonham?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying...
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Naw! That's science fiction stuff!
What do you mean by that?
I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip. He's a foreigner. I think he's probably Samoan. But it doesn't matter, does it? Are you prejudiced?
Or just think it? Was I talking? Did they hear me?
What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police! We need help!
You better be careful. Plenty of vultures out here. They'll pick your bones clean before morning.
That's good...
Why?
This is the place. They'll never fuck with us here.
Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on? Then you hear yourself mumbling.
What limes?
Have you made a deal with him? Did you put him on to her?
Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off?
Jesus.
You bastard! You'd do that, wouldn't you?
Lucy.
NO! I felt sorry for the girl, I wanted to help her!
I gave the cabbie an extra ten bucks to make sure she gets there safe. Also, I told him I'd be there myself in an hour, and if she wasn't, I'd come back out here and rip his lungs out.
Like big lizards.
Yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.
No, she's looking for you.
OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her. I'll get her off our backs. You're right. She's my problem.
There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard...
Don't take any guff from those swine. Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People.
Okay. Here's how it is. What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear?
Not my jurisdiction. The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area. Can you make it that far?
Bullshit! You're just as much a part of it as they are!
Come on, baby don't try to tell us you never heard of the Grange Gorman.
Stop!
YOU'RE KILLING HIM!
You can't keep me here. This is bullshit. Fuckin' bullshit. This is fucking BULLSHIT!
We should go! We should go right now!
Are you two all right? Did you see that!? They left! We made it! I think we made it!
We'll meet in three hours?
Where are you two going?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you.
I think I know where a CB is.
Okay, now. Easy steps. Easy breaths. Easy steps.
That's the oldest of the bunch, looked like the Grandpapa. We caught the little one, Junior, in the cooler there. As we've seen, what he lacks in size he more than makes up for in speed.
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna have a stroke.
What tunnel? Where?
HEY! No, I'm not trusting him either, that's why you and I will both be going with him.
You seem mighty collected about this.
Scared?
I'd love to be macho, but this is a pants wetter from all angles.
So, what now? Did those things leave?
What now, Geronimo?
My truck can't be more than ten feet away. We load into the back, I can get in the front and we roll out of here.
How are you holding up?
Oh, no.
Wait, before you do that, help me to the kitchen, I need to lay down. There's a cot back there.
What? Really?
He's dead.
Open?
This one will just stun ya, but this one will put ya to sleep.
I wouldn't do that, son.
Clever fuckers.
Blow the goddamn hatch!
You are taking a chance that is not worth the risk.
Where the hell are we going to go then, Billy Jack!?
Nothin' will happen to you. You get on my back, hold on tight and we truck out of here together.
Well, maybe they migrate?
Hey!
Let's move.
DON'T!
Let's wait it out.
If you are face to face with her, dive left.
There's a rifle and a shotgun here.
Shut up! Shut your mouth. You have no idea what is running through me right now. No idea.  I'm ready.
Did we make it?
I like your looks. You have the classical bone structure of the very great beauties... Garbo, Dietrich --
No, I'm concerned with everything.
Hi Frances, got a minute?
Yes, but... Really, I hate to sound... it's just that the public expects something different from its stars. People won't take you seriously.
You're afraid!
Madam...?
Okay, but come here first.
Hey, where's the fire, sister?
Cool off, beautiful. Didn't you see the sign says "Dimout Zone?"  There's a war on, you know?
Get your clothes on.
Without me.
You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
Oh, God! Let's get her out of here tonight, right now! Let's take her with us!
Were you a drug addict?
I'm... I'm really proud of you, Frances.
Well, Harry York is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. Why do you ask?
I know that, Dad, but --
Are you... are you hungry?
It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.
You're poisoning that child's mind.
Lillian... I'm more than willing to meet you halfway.
Kurt!
Age?
Only if you were in it. Are you?
Why?
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
Sure don't talk like you're sixteen.
I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.
Yeah, it's a gift. You gotta do something with it.
How ya doin', Farmer?
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Well, she's back to earth now. They're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back, kid.
Frances, you're a movie star now. If you give them what they want, you can get anything.
Tell you what. Let's ditch the limo. Let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
Oh my God, I look awful.
Evening, gorgeous.
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
To quarter-horses.
There's just one more thing.
You give up on her?
Anyway... if you need me...
Frances! Frances!
Where to?
This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you got a chance, you better take it.
You don't need to screw around anymore. You don't need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.
Sure I did, that's why I'm here.
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Pretty morning.
Shit!
...Is that not true?
Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here... I am forced to order you to begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
That's me, Clifford.
I'm not!
'But how do I know you love me?'
You think I got it?
Mama...
What?
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Don't... talk crazy.
You're not going anywhere!
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it!  That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am --  Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to!  But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
Yes...?
I don't believe so.
I'm glad to see you haven't lost your sense of humor.
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
This whole thing is a joke!
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail.  I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
I don't know why they even bother. She's had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.
And he drove me to mine.
I'm glad you finally came to the door. A man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.
It can't be as bad as that.
Friends? Do they live around here?
Come warm yourself if you like.
Yes, I speak. And read. And think... and know the ways of Man.  I've been waiting for you. Two months now.
Evil?  Do you believe in evil?
Why, Victor? Why? What were you thinking?
And if I consent?
This was not taken from a grave.
She's beautiful.
Something's wrong. I know it.  I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
I should go. I should leave today.
Are you all right?
What does it say?
Claude rode over there to see if held lost track of time. They say he never arrived.
Smell the air. Wonderful.
You will.  What do you want, Victor?
You make me weak.
Captain, I implore you. The men are frightened and angry. They want your assurance.
I'm convinced. Not by treating symptoms, but by diving nature's most jealously-guarded secrets.
Professor?
Now you've got him started.
...yes, and thanks to him, smallpox has been virtually eliminated. I've heard this speech before.
Quite a place.
Yes. I took refuge in the barn. Wouldn't you? Lost in the storm? Freezing and wet? I was exhausted and could search no longer.
I have always loved him.
Krempe has a way of provoking my temper.
To say the least. I came here to expand my mind, but honest inquiry seems strangled at every turn. All we do is cling to the old knowledge instead of seeking the new.
Why? God alone knows what it means. Until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. Hardly fit for the classroom.
Victor. He was trying to be gracious.
Frostbite. Gangrene. A simple diagnosis.
Ah. An explorer.
Creature? A... human like creature?
So young, so pretty. What monster could have done such a thing?
Cabin B is ready.
That's got her. Thanks. I'm Steve Christy. Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake. You got some grubby clothes? Climb into 'em. Alice, see if Bill has cleaned out the boathouse. I want him to start with the canoes. What happened to Brenda?
You draw very well.
Next Friday.
Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched.
Help you clean up?
I don't hear it anymore.
What's the matter with it?
I wouldn't know.
Somebody's there, Barry.
Let's go back, Barry...
What the hell?
This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine.
I'll be okay. Holy shit...
Floor probably leaks. This area is full of springs.
You ever fire one of those bows again, and I'll tack you up on the wall to dry.
No wonder they lost America. How could you sneak around in the bushes wearing that? What's to eat?
What hath God wrought?
Like waves. It's never been likes waves before.
Cowboy.
Last line of Gone With the Wind?
Yeah. I got it on before this --  -- all started.
What was that?
No, but I passed by it a couple of times. It's out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there wouldn't be a lot of police. And it's open from dusk till dawn. You said meet you in the morning.
What about Kate?
Son, I have this situation under control. I know exactly what I'm doing. You're going to have to trust me on this.
Why did they block the door again?
What's the story with you two? You a couple of fags?
How does that happen? You don't look Japanese.
Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.
My children are not going with you, and that's that.
Yes.
How'd she die?
Come on, gimme some more details. How'd it happen? Some fuckin' drunk kill her?
Died instantly?
Then?
Out of the stew pot and into the fire.
Why not, against your religion?
What are you going to do?
I don't know about that. In order for it to have any power, I think it's gotta be an official crucifix.
Did he...?
I promise.
Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my pussy?
What?
Mexico.
What did I say?
You got three minutes. One second longer, I shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?
Watch my back!
See ya.
-- see this, television!
For the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours. The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.
They'll probably make a run for the border, which would bring 'em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit asses, we're talking payback time. We'll get 'em all right. I gotta piss. I'm gonna use your commode.
What dya mean?
What the fuck was that about?
Start the car.
Richie? You okay?
Do they have an X-rated channel?
Is it me? Is it my fault?
Yes, Seth, I understand.
Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you're okay?
I'm lookin' scared?
You know what you look like?
He's right, Kate. Daddy's dead! He was too far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those bat-things would save him, I'd fling it. The only thing it'll do is turn us into one of them.
Can I ask you somethin', lieutenant? How come you're doing this?  I mean, we're kinda curious.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m.  From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President.  This my shade?  "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
No, sir, WHAT?
Then good night.
I don't know of any delicate way to say this, lieutenant, so I won't try.  Claims have been made that you have engaged in fraternization -- of the same-sex variety.  Specifically, that you were...  "... seen leaving the apartment of another female officer at such a time and in such a manner as to suggest conduct unbecoming."
Sir.  If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Shit.  Think we're had.
Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it!
Yes?
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens.  You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
Captain Dwyer.  Technically.
Uh, question, ma'am.
Jordan.  I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
So?  Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
What are you saying?  That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable.
Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things.
Six o'clock!  Marking, marking!
She's an officer.  There's a higher standard.
Of course it is.  And I'm gonna stay on her until everyone realizes this is not some bullshit equal-rights thing, that real lives are gonna be lost.  Maybe mine, maybe yours.
Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses.  Where you been the last few years?
Just a coincidence?
Chances of recovery?
That was good headwork, lieutenant.
So why're you even considering it? Are you?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
"John James Urgayle."  The Chief.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments.  This guy's in and out in one year -- your year.  That sound right?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane"... Second run at Coronado... and correct, they had him stashed in the "Appropriation Liaison Office," whatever that is.
I'd sure like to know who.
It was made clear.  Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half.
Hey.  Way to gut it out.
Wick.  They got your crew, too?
Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted.
Do you, uh, know...
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special.
Say again, sir?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for?
You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now.
That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you?
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
WOULD YOU JUST GET OUTTA HERE?
I just wonder how that happened.
You don't suppose this is just part of...
This ain't workin' right!
Audrey's going to stay with us tonight.
Where's Audrey?
My God. He's going after the nest.
Animal, I can't.
What are you doing?
Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway.
Audrey?! Is that you? Hi, hello. You look, wow, uh, how've you been?
So you made it.
That was eight years ago. Some people change, you know.
Blood sample? How close did you get to that thing?
Is this cause of me? Because of the story?
Circuits are overloaded.
Who was that French guy, anyway.
And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s.
I can't believe he put the moves on me. After everything I've done for him.
Did Romeo have a name?
Your old sweetheart?
The warm feeling of helping your fellow man.
I can't.
You don't understand, I can get us information...
Hi. Nick Tatopoulos...
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over three million people. Has that ever been done before?
They didn't make it.
And how should we do that, Sir?
Who are they? Lieutenant, get those people away from there.
You didn't answer my question. In fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.
Somebody must have seen it.
Do you have any idea what's going on out there? The phones are ringing off the hook with people screaming to be let back into the city.
Are you looking for this?
We know.
So why all the secrecy? Why aren't you guys working with the US military?
It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about.
What's with the chewing gum?
Who the hell are you?
Dr. Lazarus... I hope that I'm not breaching protocol but.. I am so very humbled to stand in your presence... I have studied your missions extensively... Though I am Thermian, I have lived my life by your philosophy, by the code of the Mak'tar.
Just as on your home planet, sir. If I may say, it took me three years to master the spikes, but now I sleep with a peace I never thought possible...
God, what an ass.
About this much.
Go ahead!
Jason, before we entered the black hole, my instruments detected strange energy surge from Sarris' shiD~ similar to...
He's a twit!
He wants to THINK!?
This is ludicrous.  Why are you listening to this man?  Must I remind you that he is wearing a costume, not a uniform?...  He's no more equipped to lead us than THIS fellow.  No offense.
Oh Alex, get away from that thing...
May I get the check?
Those blue things ate everybody here?
Back there. You said "the Commander is down there with a bunch of cannibals."
Hi Brandon.
Oh.  Okay.
... Yes?
How did you come to that conclusion?
What?  Up?
The ship is sustaining structural damage.
The enemy is matching velocity.
Negative, no reserve Beryllium sphere exists onboard.
We've got to get that valve turned off. Their oxygen Is almost gone...
It doesn't have to be a hologram... Just a diversion.
"Assault on Voltareck III."  Episode... 31 I think.
~e're alive!
A few fans built a little set in their garage.  .  I come in for an hour at most. It's a nothing.
It's Jason...
Let me try.  Computer?  Computer?...
We're leaving, Jason. We're leaving NOW.
Are they behind us?
So... We get to shut down the neutron reactor?
We shouldn't have to DO this!  It makes NO LOGICAL SENSE! Why is it HERE?
Tommy, look!  Those lights...
Right.  Well... Listen, I'm  I'm sorry about that whole... thing.. before. It was kind of a misunderstanding.  I'm sure we can work this out like reasonable people... How's the uh...  ... that going to heal up? God, I hope so, I feel just awful about that.
Listen, I'd like to, but frankly.. I'm not even sure where it is, or even...
Is it a bomb?  A booby trap?  Tell me!
Wait. What did you say?
My name is Jason Nesmith. I'm an actor. We're all actors.
We.. We lie.
Accelerate to Mark 4, Tommy.
Commander, I must speak to you. It is a matter of supreme importance... We are Thermians from the Klatu Nebula, and we require your help. I beseech you to come with us, back to our ship. A great many lives hang in the balance...
Commander?... Where are you... going?
Theramin.
But what if Sarris survives?
He has a very powerful ship. Perhaps you would like to wait to see the results of-
An interstellar vox.
How can we thank you, Commander. You- You have saved our people.
"Deception..." "Lies."
... to make sure craft service keeps those little butter cookies, and plenty of them-
What's going on?
Excuse me?
Well, it's... This was a device we...  discovered on an alien planet.  We don't know what it does either.
Faster Tommy. Get us out of here!
Oh, right, sorry.
Sorry Guys... It just went off.
The throat, the mouth... Its vulnerable spots.
All right guys... Uh... Gwen and I are going to have to get to the core and shut it down manually. Fred, you and Guy need to get that air valve back on.  Alex, see if you can get the prison doors open downstairs in case Fred and Guy can't get the oxygen back in time.
Pedal to the metal Tommy...
Find them.
Well, now there's something worth dying for.  What do you think?
Go on... I want to hear everything.
After visiting Congress I know what it's like being violated by come disproportionate asses!  Ah, if she only knew that the most important men in the country -- possibly the world -- are sitting at this table...
There was this anonymous pamphlet circulated at Congress which says I am personally responsible for all our hardships.  And... that I have encouraged the people of America to make me into a God!  Benedict, it says that I have gone mad!
These men were taken from their homes at night, tried by Reed's courts -- which Congress recognizes -- and, well, you can see.
Colonel, sir, Mrs. Washington inquires if you are going to join her for dinner?
You, you just need a new flint, General.
What?  What are you talking about?
Negroes?  Washington has black men in his army?  Are they good fighters?  What's that red ribbon on his arm, Colonel?
What the goddamned hell do you think you are doing!?
Who is that!?
I was a clerk's apprentice on Saint Croix.  But, then I went to King's College.
General Greene is here.  There are two other divisions here.
Yessir.
What's your advice, Alexander?
Have you decided if you are going to join the Virginia Delegation to the Constitutional Convention?
With your support, Horatio.  As one of our own who has seen combat with the British, your opinion counts.
They are... friends of Congress.
Let's not over do it...
Partially...
A grand scheme?
No.  As a matter of fact I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.
Arnold is indispensable, do you understand?  I need Arnold to help me win this war!
Gentlemen, my I introduce a French gentleman, recently appointed major general by Congress...  Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette. General Lafayette has brought us the greetings and goodwill of his countrymen, and... how many cases of muskets, Mon petite Marquis?
You must be very rich.
These supplies...?
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
When I was a young man we used to recite Cato... We would come together recite it like they were words from heaven.  Devotion to country, duty, purity of heart... Purity of heart.  I was drunk on something then...
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
We can't take them.  Are you all right?
Sir, if you don't mind my saying, I don't understand your history at all.  I mean, why would you want to win the war?  You're not after glory, like Benedict...  You're a slave owner, and yet you invite blacks to fight in your army.
At one time I could have chosen not to be.
We can grow three primary crops in a season and, if we have some luck, we get a forth.  The temperature is generally mild.
Cranes?  Who needs to walk like a crane?
I don't laugh at you, George.  I like you.  I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
I say!
What is this?
I reserved a Cadillac.
Doesn't matter what it's called, Harry's got Martin Weir and it's gonna be big.
You see the paper?
Whoa... This is the man used to jump offa high buildings?
And if we don't happen to find it under Palmer's mattress or inside Karen Flores' undie drawer? What then?
You get the money?
You gave him the money?
Now why would you do that? Put the money in a locker?
What's this movie you're doing first?
Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
There's Ilona.
You know how to write one of these?
The three hundred grand you got from a little dry cleaner named Leo.
I'm at 8150 Wonderland Avenue. It's right off Laurel.
Where's Karen?
Harry, you think we go to see your movies? I've seen better film on teeth. Makes no difference to me which one our money's in. So how 'bout you take our twenty points out of "Freaks" and put 'em in this other one, "Mr. Loverboy".
I'm working on a few things.
I don't know.
Yeah? Well, trust me. I'm very for real.
Harry Zimm. The man happens to be a major Hollywood player.
What?
Who the fuck are you?
What're you doing in Los Angeles?
I'm looking at you.
That's what I'm doing.
I want you to.
Come on, Harry -– Mesas? The worst they might do is get a judgment against you, uttering a bad check. I can't imagine you want that to happen, man in your position.
I imagine in your line of work, there were times you had to get rough, you know, say one of your customers stopped paying.
Murray Saffrin, guy who wrote it, did all my Grotesque pictures, had it in a drawer for twenty years. He shows it to me one day, tells me he's got a star interested, would I produce it.
You don't even know these guys.
No leave 'em up, we want the light in their eyes. I'll be at the desk... but don't introduce me, let it go, just start talking. You're gonna be here, behind 'em when they sit down.
You don't say any more'n you have to. You say, 'Well, I'm glad you assholes stopped by, so I can set you straight.'
What?
That's the difference between you and me, Harry. I say what I mean. I want something from someone, I ask 'em straight out. I want Martin Weir, I go get Martin Weir. I don't fuck around with his trainer's shrink.
Really.
So how 'bout it, Mr. Selznick, do I make my deal with Bo? Or you gonna finally help me out, have a word with your dry cleaner when you find him.
Harry, if I gave you Leo's money you'd have Ray Bones all over your ass and then you'd be in a whole new kinda trouble.
Bullshit. E.g. is short for 'ergo'.
I'm thinking of a movie.
One we're producing.
I turn it on when I confront the guy.
So when do I meet up with the husband and give him the look?
You take all my money, but you're borrowing part of it?
Mr. Barboni is a good customer.  Works for Jimmy Capp.
Well, basically, this guy owes a shylock fifteen thousand, plus he's a few weeks behind on the vig, the interest you have to pay.
Ripped nylons work. Makes the shot more real.
How come you stopped making movies with Harry?
You read Harry's new one? He says it's the best thing he's ever read.
Tell you what, I'll stop by Harry's office and pick up a copy for you.
So what about your story. You thought of a title yet?
Yeah?
You don't mean a movie star? More like a character actor?
Harry... My God...
I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
Yeah, but whose point of view?
I miss Murray, Harry.
So this means you've reconsidered our deal on Mr. Lovejoy?
Anyone skim the pool? It needs it.
How did you get in the house?
That Miami flight that went down, it was on the news every day for about a week. Harry must've been busy.
With your experience, you could always become an agent. Right, Harry?
Well. I got an audition tomorrow.
The three hundred large. What other money is there?  I should keep quiet, I know, till I've read the script, but I've got a feeling about this one. I'm that shylock.
Karen. Wow. Look at you...
Lufkin. His... agent.
North Island, please repeat? Over.
Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Your radio check is affirmative. Over.
Fucker!
Damn mind of it's own.
Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure.
The turbine blew.
Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy.  Any questions?
Maybe that is his boat.
What say, Epps? You up for some roasted albatross?
With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop.
How long, then?
So what're we gonna do. That's the big question, right?
Then we're rich. We're damn, filthy stinking rich.
You better get down here quick, skipper. I'm on "C" deck. Cabin 400.
There's no way we're gonna hide a few thousand pounds of gold from the Coastguard here. Besides, it'll be safer where it is.
Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?!
What the fuck -- ?
I didn't touch the fucking radio!  Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper?
We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first.
Morning everybody.
Looks like one hell of a stick up his ass.
Stay away. Or else.
What?
The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try.
Maybe they didn't want it back. Maybe the whole fat deal was insured.
Who?
What? What the hell're you talking about.
They're dead in the water that morning. Four hours later the captain's relieved of his command. And that evening they issue a general SOS.
Smashed it up pretty bad.
The page's missing. Then their SOS was real.
Maybe the other ship took the worst of it.
It's a good bet they'll be asking a lot of questions when they get here too.
Hey.
The what?
What happened.
No. I think they are, were, just passengers. Innocent victims.
Murphy to Epps.
Nope.
Epps? You there?
Over the gold.
They went crazy.
Greer to Murphy.
Yeah.
All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it.
Greek citizen. Merchant navy.  Obviously we aren't the first to come across this ship. They probably stumbled across it just like we did.
It's a Noaa buoy.
He took the shotgun and a light.
What about the gold?
Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it.  You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
What seems to be the trouble, ladies?
No, no. You got leak.
That cost me twenty grand at least.
Have you seen my blue spatula?
Will you get off my back for once?
Guess.
Someone from the past.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
I'm so excited to see this film - Dustoffvarnya is such a brilliant director! Did you see his last film, The Flower That Drank The Moon? It was simply glorious!
I-I honestly never intended for this to happen...
Enid and I were just friends. You know... we feel comfortable around each other... she really likes my old records and...
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
What are you doing? You don't ever criticize the feature!
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Hi... what's up?
What do you mean "why"?
Nothing.
Oh, hi...
God, what a bunch of retards...
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
Why?
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want.  It's such a weird feeling.
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
Look, maybe that's him!
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
What's going on now? What's he doing?
What's he doing now?
He's insane!
Ew, look at this...
Not really...
"Funky"?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
Where are we going?
What was that all about?
I didn't get it either.
How about this one?
Ew ... when did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
You're gross.  See that guy?
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment...  Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
Don't you want nice stuff?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
When was this?
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
My acting workshop is across the street from here. I'm just on my break.
I want to know what you think you're doing, staying out all night and worrying your father to death!
Perhaps the "Jam-in-ator" appeals to you.  Absolutely no practice necessary.  You shread like a giant. Just press a button.
Do you have any other old records besides these?
You still interested in that?
Punk rock is over!
Oh, how "punk."
...are you waiting for a bus?
Well, if it isn't Enid and Rebecca, the little Jewish girl and her Aryan friend.
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
That's five hundred dollars.
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
There's some good stuff in here... do you like old music?
Is this one any good?
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
Yeah, sure, I guess...
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
Really? Can I see it?
God, look at this poster!  I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Uh, I don't have much money with me right now.
Relax, Seymour, relax...
It's not hopeless...
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
I'm not sure I have anything to drink... there might be some --
Wow, this is so cool...
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
Actually, I was a whole lot more interested in the Cook's phenomenon when I was about your age. I've kind of lost interest since I've been working for them...
Nothing so glamorous... actually, I'm an assistant manager at their corporate headquarters.
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then  even though there was stuff like this?
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
Well when can we do something?
I don't know... I'm sorry, but Dana's a very jealous person. I just don't want to screw that up right now... I'm sure she'll dump me soon and we can go back to being friends...
What's up?
Uh... sure... come in.
That's Dana's - I'm supposed to be saving it for our two-month anniversary. You better not --
If you expect the worst, you're never disappointed.
You're a beautiful young girl... I can't imagine you would ever have had any interest in me, except as an amusingly cranky eccentric curiosity.
I was just thinking out loud...  I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Please Josh?
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
I agree.
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
He sees this chaos, he'll replace you all.
Morning, friend, glorious day.
You've never built in Africa.
Lovely sound- they seem happy.
Awhile back he ordered some bibles-  -I've brought them.  Is he here?
And it worked?
Let me explain about time- you've been here three months and already two months behind. And the Germans and the French are gearing up. And I don't care about you and I don't care about the thirty dead- I care about my knighthood and if this railroad finishes on schedule, I'll get my knighthood and I want it.  Professional hunters may be the answer.
I know it's your first day and of course you must be tired from the journey-  -but what are you going to do about it?
-then he feasted on him, starting with his feet-
Silliest thing I ever heard of- why in the world should we go through all that?
I tried to be late, John- it would have been easier if you'd gone.
-oh please- if I'd been against your taking this, you would have abandoned me. You've been desperate to see Africa your whole life.
Don't much like them.
Anything special about them?
We all have our reasons. Mine is simply to make them understand happiness, accept salvation, know the serenity that comes-  -best I stop. One of the by-products of my belief is that I can become amazingly boring. But I know God smiles on me.
Finish your tour?
You said "of course" you'd need the donkey. Why "of course"?
What a good week.
Got me out of trouble.
Have you got it?
...misfire... it jammed...
Where could it have gone? How could it get across the water?  They're only lions, yes?
How many do you think they've killed?
The workers don't get on?
For you.
Why do you laugh?- you don't believe she taught me?
How many cattle?
We'll be very sorry to lose you.  Perhaps I could take you to lunch today?
Janosz?
Time is running out, Dana.  Soon it will be midnight and the city will be mine -- and Vigo's.  Well, mainly Vigo's.  But we have a spectacular opportunity to make the best of our relationship.
Venkman?  I think he was borderline for a while there.  Then he crossed the border.
That's where the buggy stopped.
I wish I could stay.  I feel personally responsible for you being here.
You're really good, you know.
I'm sure you didn't come here just to talk about art.
He was also a lunatic and a genocidal madman. I hate this painting.  I've felt very uncomfortable since they brought it up from storage.
Who could blame him?  Were you wearing this nightgown?
Be careful on that sofa -- it's a butt-biter. But the bed's good and I just changed the sheets so if you get tired, feel free.  In fact, I think you should definitely plan on spending the night here.
Did you happen to see some shirts on the floor in here?
So -- are you making any New Year's resolutions?
I'm not even good for me.
I received this information from an alien.  I was at the Paramus Holiday Inn, I was having a drink in the bar when he approached me and started talking.  Then he must have used some sort of ray or a mind control device because he made me follow him to his room and that's where he told me about the end of the world.
Before you go running to the newspapers with this, would you consider telling this slime thing to some people downtown?
Pleasure to meet you.  I've seen you on television.
We don't go around altering valuable paintings, Dr. Venkman.
Dr. Venkman?  Dana is not here.
I, Vigo, the scourge of Carpathia --
-- the sorrow of Moldavia --
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
This is my cousin Sherman.  Sherm, say hello to the Ghostbusters.  I promised him a ride in the car if he got you out.
Hi, welcome back to the 'World of the Psychic,' I'm Peter Venkman and I'm chatting with my guest, author, lecturer and of course, psychic, Milton Anglund.  Milt, your new book is called The End of the World.  Isn't that kind of like writing about gum disease.  Yes, it could happen, but do you think anybody wants to read a book about it?
So what are you saying?  That the world of the supernatural is your special province?
I'd like to have a stool specimen
It's working.  The positive GeV's are climbing.
So far so good.
Nothing.  Not a trace.
Hey, I didn't imagine it.  There must have been ten thousand gallons of it down there.
I'm Egon --
Six feet -- seven -- eight --
We've found it at every event site we've been to lately.
Rivers of the stuff!
Late Renaissance, I think.  Caravaggio or Brunelleschi.
Great.  So what are you guys working on?
Who?
Who?  Who?  Who?
Geez, I forgot how heavy these things are.
I'm Ray --
Beautiful, beautiful.  Work with me, baby. Just have fun with it.  Okay, he's playing it cool.  Let's finish up and get out of here.
What happened?
I don't think they make Nikes in her size.
Are you telling me how to drive?
Are you all right?
What are we doing?  Ray, I was ready to kill you.
It better not start yet.  I'm trying to finish my potholder before lunch.
Aren't you glad we waited?
Oh, no, I feel great.  I just ordered some more vitamins.  I see you were exercising. So was I.  I taped "20 Minute Workout" and played it back at high speed so it only took ten minutes and I got a really good workout. You wanna have a mineral water with me?
You know you shouldn't leave your TV on so loud when you go out.  That creep down the hall phoned the manager.
Are you the Gatekeeper?
Like a used car salesman.
That's too bad.
Uh-huh.
I don't have to take abuse from you.  I have other people dying to give it to me.
Who's the stiff?
Can't you tell me now?
All right.  Since you put it that way.
Hey, Dana.  What is it?  What happened?
He is the Destructor.
Do you want this body?
I don't know.  You've got two people in there already.  It could get a little crowded.  I want you to close your eyes and relax.  Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
But why?  The students love us!
Hello, I'm Roger Delacorte - the Head Librarian.  Are you the men from the University?
Egon, there's something very strange about that man.  I'm very psychic usually and right now I have this terrible feeling that something awful is going to happen to you.  I'm afraid you're going to die.
In the physical sense.
Why don't you step into the office and we'll talk about it.  Hold all my calls, Janine.
Here's the paper on the Brooklyn job.  She paid with a Visa card.
And someone from the EPA is here to see you.
I see.  And now you catch ghosts?
All right.  What is it?
Hey!  I'm getting a little tired of this.
Yes?
Spengler, are you serious about actually catching a ghost?
Generally, you don't see that kind of behavior in a major appliance.  What do you think, Egon?
Did you see anything?
He wants to shut down the storage grid.
Yes.  After the First World War Shandor decided that society was too sick to survive.  And he wasn't alone.  He had close to a thousand followers when he died.  They conducted rituals, bizarre rituals, intended to bring about the end of the world.
Look at the structure of the roof cap.  It looks exactly like the kind of telemetry tracker NASA uses to identify dead pulsars in other galaxies.
Excuse me for a minute.  Ray, I'm right in the middle of something here.  Can you come back in about an hour?
Sure.  That's great, Ray.  I think you should get down there right away and check it out.  Let me know what happens.
I told you it's real.
Anything!  Just make contact.
Do you know what a patent clerk makes?  I liked the University.  They gave us money, they gave us the facilities and we didn't have to produce anything!  I've worked in the private sector.  They expect results. You've never been out of college.  You don't know what it's like out there.
You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
But most people are afraid to even report these things.
How was your date?
I'm getting high readings near the air vents.  It must be using the duct system to get around.  See, I told you we'd get something.
Agile bastard, isn't he?
AND YOU CAME UP WITH THAT?
Hey man.  What is it you're so involved with there?
Ray, do you remember something in the Bible about a day when the dead would rise up from their graves?
I should at least have you, don't you think?
Did Narcissus die today?  Wasn't this his day to die?
For the gods, spit it out!
Where have you been?
You must start clearing everything with me -- especially your lovers.
Then you'd be out of a job.
I'm ordering a general stand-down in preparation for withdrawal back across the Danube.
AGH!  Please!  He's having a secret device constructed for the circus. The brass craftsmen are working overtime.
So tell me, what happened between you and the emperor?  What really happened on the German front?  You know the Senate's arguing your case...
The Emperor and I are bound by the threads of The Fates.  He was born on August thirty-first, you know.
Would you support the Senate if they would give you a trial?  You'd have to give me your word.
You're a citizen and a soldier.  Not a gladiator.
No future-telling, please, I've been terrified enough for one day.
How do you know I am playing?  Well, the clown is always harmless.  Isn't that right?  And how did you ever get to know me so well?  The last we spent any time together I was fourteen.  I think you know me better than my father.  He's going to die, isn't he?
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
To think I brought my daughters up on all things Roman.  Read to sleep on Catullus, Lucretius... Virgil... every night.  My beautiful daughters.
Commodus, it's we who are going on the offensive.
I want you to start your work for the last phase of the campaign.
It's not because he's young, it's because he's ignorant and arrogant. His sister is a better man.  That's why I have undertaken to begin sweeping changes in the relationship between the emperor and the Senate.
The Senators admire you.
They fear change.  The new Caesar must be honest enough to know when the emperorship is no longer feasible.  You could be the one, the Emperor, the man who oversees the rebirth of the Republic.
Why don't we try to keep politics out of the conversation.
On his death bed I promised Marcus I would complete our work here.  The Senate may be vacillating, but I have the army behind me.  I'm taking half a cohort and restocking that fort.
Then give the empire back to the people... the children who will grow up to become senators...
He's very realistic.
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
You need to come home!
Very fancy.  Did you design the bottle?
I'm a soldier -- we're at war.  I can't stay home tending the damned olive groves?
When you get to Ostia, use this -- bribe passage to Africa or Spain. Save my family.  You should be able to find a merchant ship that will take you to Egypt then to Numidia.
Thank you.  What is going to happen tomorrow?  Exactly?
Take your hands off me animal!
General, do you realize what happened out there today?
You put this inside your shirt -- when Tiger stabs your stomach -- it's full of pig's blood.  Gushes out everywhere!  It's really impressive.  Fantastic!  Better than the real thing!
You get to come alive again in the country!
Tell me honestly, since this may be our last earthly meeting:  if this were a fair fight where would you put your money?
They want to dump Tiger and have me endorse their damned chariot, right? They don't waste time...
I want another interview with Cos. Tell him to bring plenty of ink.
Commodus must hate you.  Free your gladiators and come with us.
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Will you take me home now?
I think I'd better go home now please.
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Where we going?
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Benjamin --
What's the matter?
Don't cry. 
Where are you meeting this person?
Yes.
I don't understand --
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
What are you looking for?
What are you going to do now?
Are you going home?
You won't?
Is that so? You might marry me?
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Oh no. He said that.
Benjamin?
Well -- you see -- the doctor is at his son's wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now. He should be checking in any moment --
Ben.
Ben -- I just want to say one word to you -- just one word --
You a student?
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Give me an hour.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
What do you think of me?
No.
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Her portrait?
No.
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
But they would! Don't you see?
Yes, I do.
May I sit down?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Did you get us a room?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Why don't you get it.
Well -- goodbye then --
Well.
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
You can admit that, can't you?
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
Anything. Anything at all.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
How do you get out of the house?
We're talking.
Right.
Why did you do that?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Well how did it happen?
Really. I want to know.
No.
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Do you understand that?
What are you doing?
But it's not.
Oh no.  Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
Well --
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Thank you very much, sir.
Thank you.
Sir?
I know.
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
You miss the point.
Can you see me now?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
What's happening?
I don't believe it.
It's a short life and a gay one...
And what are you going to do?
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
Like dancing?
Oh!
Reducing?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...  ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
I'd given you up.
Chasing around.
Yes -- I'd love to.
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
You live here?
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
I want to be alone.
I want to be alone --
Why do you smile?
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I'll not denounce you.
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
You do believe that I really love you?
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
I'm worried about you.
Thank you, sir.
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
The Baron is tired?
If I could get into a game I might win some.
Is that too much, Baron?
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Good evening -- my key -- one sixty- eight.
Grusinskaya -- well, to tell the truth, Baron -- tonight we are a little bit nervous. Were you at the theatre last night?
Well -- last night was not so good.
The war.
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
Anyone asked for me?
Oh -- but -- I --
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
I'm engaged for the evening.
Dance then? 
Really?
Please -- please!
Yes, of course, -- money!
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know --  I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
No.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel? 
I must go to England -- at once.
Insolent young cub!
Oh, no.
Oh -- ho -- you want legal aid against us? -- The whole thing seems to me to be very simple.
What?
I mean with the Manchester people?
No water -- What a place!
I know you did -- I said you did --
Evil days -- I've shown you here --  -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Sorry, Preysing. 
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
How clear is Manchester?
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
I can't dance tonight --
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?  ...Or is that the time?
Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
Take them back, Suzette.
Yes, the police must be called.
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
If you will wait one moment, sir.
Just one moment, sir.
What's the use of asking, Gru -- he is at the train -- He will be there.
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
I know -- I know.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Next week.
What the fuck are you doin with a son?
He's a good kid. A salesman.
You're a thousand percent right!
Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people been telling me the same thing.
The kids beat him up, because his home life is, uh, different.
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.
Well, I'll have to take your word for it, Mary Beth. Here's your money.
Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...
Here you are! Two rich people!
Yes, yes, but that's --
Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.
Take two, three days. Call when you get there.
This is some of the finest filigreed platinum I've ever seen. But the stones, no. They're not diamonds, Mrs. Langtry.
You'll give us an opportunity to serve you again, I hope. If there's anything you think we might be interested in...
What? Me?
See you in a week, Roy. I can call you Roy?
And I'm Perk. Short for Percy, I'm afraid.
Oh, come on, Roy.
I like those.
Sure.
Why?
Roy, I don't want money from you.
Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a minute, tell me about it.
Why should they? The cops are satisfied.
I wouldn't go in on a deal with her. She blamed you for it.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
For God's sake, Lilly!
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
That isn't granite. If that fell on me, it wouldn't hurt at all.
Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me off my game?
Great to get away, take it easy. Next week, I'll get back to work.
Nobody does that single-o.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
I just bet you are, too. And now you're trying to rope me.
Running your broker scam, you mean.
Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we're partners?
Don't I get any say in this?
What I say is, no. We don't do partners.
Roy Dillon?
I realize this is a shock.
Sure. Let's get it over.
Well, thank you. And thank them.
One set of muddy shoe prints.
Where, judging by the looks of the finger and palm prints, she struggles to open the window before banging on it like hell.
The killer knocks the knife out of her hand with the wrought-iron poker.
Carter.
Mind if we sit down?
Funny, we just drove right in.
Do you know who did this?
Besides, it's historically inaccurate.
Michael Meyers never used a meat cleaver.  It was a butcher knife.
Hey, Mis Whittington, what's up?
Nothing to fear.  The coast is clear.
Totally.  I checked all the rooms and closets...
What the --
Oh, so now it's my fault?
I'm sorry, alright?  It was just a stupid joke.
What?  Where is she?
What are you doing here?!
Better?
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
Linda!  He killed Linda!
Hey, you alright?
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
Ooooh, busted.
You're so easy...
He do that to you?
What are you doing there?  Where's my mother?
Seven-thirty is the costume pageant ... Carving jack-o'-lanterns at eight ... Photos for the school paper at nine ... Then Harry lights the tree at nine- thirty ... I just know I'm forgetting something!
Shh.  Mommy's here.  What is it?
They did, did they?  Since when did we start listening to the kids at school?
Mom, I want to go to the fair ...
Mommy!!!
What should I do?
God ... this can't be true.
Come on, sweetheart -- what is this? Who's coming?
So they're trying to kill you and your baby. Don't tell me.  Your name also happens to be Rosemary.
She wasn't here when I brought Danny home from --
Do you know how insane this is?  Who am I supposed to be looking for?
Kyle's mother might be dead for all I know. Now I'm afraid he could be next.
It was there when I found him this morning.  It looks like some kind of letter or number or --
Halloween.
Danny!  Danny, where are you?!
Christ, what a night!  Not even so much as a sign for five miles on that road!
We need you, Dr. Loomis.
It was her voice.  On the radio.  It was Jamie.  Calling for me.
Your madness is another man's greatness.  This is the way things have always been.  You've just been too blinded by your own reality to see.  But having you on the outside has been convenient for us in many ways.  You always did come through -- our loyal watch dog. Finding him. Bringing him back to us once he'd finished his work.  Although after you had that nasty stroke the last time, I had to go after him myself.  And what a terrible time we had getting him out of that jail cell.
Yes?
No -- there had to be someone else. Who knew?!
A bitch.
It appears that we're going to have to wait awhile for any more action here, Colonel.  Why don't you run on home while the evening's young.
No.
I wish you'd tell Alice that.  And that Goddamn Mrs. Wheeler.
Otherwise, how are things?
Fourteen times you told me.  I counted.
You'd get this funny look in your eyes, and I'd say to myself, "Oh, Jesus--he's going to tell me what a retiarius is again."
Go to the funeral?
All the more reason to go to Africa.
I don't think so.  It could have been.
Who's going to fly our helicopter now?
Gee whiz--
I wouldn't drop my gun.
I'm smarter than Looseleaf.
No matter what you say to me, I still think you're the greatest guy I ever knew.
Oh hell.
Behind a desk for a little while.  A desk!  They had him planning air raids.  A city can't flee like a coward or fight like a man, and the choice between fleeing and fighting was at the core of the life of Harold Ryan.  There was only one thing he enjoyed more than watching someone make that choice, and that was making the choice himself.  Ask about Spain, where he was the youngest soldier in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade.  He was a famous sniper.  They called him "La Picadura"--"the sting."
Ask about the time he and I were parachuted into Yugoslavia to join a guerrilla band--in the war against the Nazis.
You're supposed to get hurt!
He seems to think they are.  He told me that were.
Yes, wife, it is.  Come here, boy.  Your father is home.
Alive and hale.  He's throwing a little surprise party for his own family.  Is your mother often this unstable?  Penelope!
Tomorrow's Saturday.  Anyway, she's dead.
Dad's got jungle fever, Mom. What'll I do?  Mom!
Play?
What's this?
Can I help you, sir?
Eighteen--  and a half.
Sir?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married.  My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
I'm engaged.
This is crazy.
What's the matter?
What sort of time period do you have in mind?  Half an hour?  An hour?
This reunion isn't what I imagined it would be.
Bluh.
Your old beau?
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
I'm going to touch your shoulders very gently now.  You mustn't scream.  So tense, so tense.
You're thinking with your brain instead of your body.  That's why you're so tense!  Forget Norbert. Relax.  It's body time.
She's up in Heaven now.  She didn't hear.  She is experiencing nothing but pure happiness.  There's nothing nicer than that.  Chow!  Harold Ryan wants chow!
That's what you're supposed to say.
It couldn't!
Fish can't feel.
Such as?...
And he keeps it in his apartment?
He did his best to destroy my most precious possession, which is the high opinion women have of me.  I'm now going to even that score.  I'm going to break in his door and I'm going to smash his violin.
I came for Paul as well.
Did you like it, dear?
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
And you, a supposedly healthy woman, do not detest him for his cowardice?
An Indian narcotic we were forced to drink.  It put us in a haze--a honey-colored haze which was lavender around the edge.  We laughed, we sang, we snoozed.  When a bird called, we answered back. Every living thing was our brother or our sister, we thought. Looseleaf stepped on a cockroach six inches long, and we cried.  We had a funeral that went on for five days--for the cockroach!  I sang "Oh Promise Me." Can you imagine? Where the hell did I ever learn the words to "Oh Promise Me"?  Looseleaf delivered a lecture on maintenance procedures for the hydraulic system of a B-36.  All the time we were drinking more blue soup, more blue soup!  Never stopped drinking blue soup.  Blue soup all the time. We'd go out after food in that honey-colored haze, and everything that was edible had a penumbra of lavender.
Beautiful, you say?  It wasn't life, it wasn't death--it wasn't anything!  Beautiful?  Seven years gone--  like that, like that!  Seven years of silliness and random dreams! Seven years of nothingness, when there could have been so much!
I mean it!
Help your mother find the bullet.
Hello?  Oh--hello, Mother.
...Who?... Did she say how far apart the pains were?... When was that?... Oh dear.
Will you please go?  An emergency!
Yes!  Yes!  The boy!  One boy!
Safe and sound, I see.  Oh--you came back.
None.
Congratulations.  By crossing twenty-eight feet of cockroach- infested carpet, you've become the third white man ever to hear of it.
This is man to man.
You're old--so old.
You're a son of a bitch.
Hands and knees, you say?
You hope.
You can never take yourself seriously again!  Look at all the creatures you've protected us from! Did you shoot them on the elevator, as they were on their way up here to eat us alive?
Something seems to have happened to my self-respect.
Was I ever of use?
Like the saber-toothed tiger.
Can't do it.
Thank you--for my life.
Dead!
What happened?
How horrible.
Won't you please join our club? Please?
Is it?  I have this theory about why men kill each other and break things.
She's my date tonight.  What do you want her to do--bring the poor old jaguars back to life with a bicycle pump?  Bugger off!  Ask Paul what he thinks.  Your mother looks beautiful--right?  Kid?  Doesn't your mother look nice?  Paul?
I had not the slightest inkling.  Why didn't you say so?
No.
I know.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
That's an interesting piece of news.
Not true.
In a railroad accident many years ago.
I hate that thing.
Is Norbert still here?
Mom?
What are his symptoms?
My father!
Don't worry about it.
He isn't?
Yes?
I'm touched.
Did you see him?
Is he coming home?
The park!
Did you talk to Paul?
What was it?
Thank you, Herb.  You're a wonderful man.  You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
You were wonderful.
Oh no!  Wear a coat of cotton--wear a coat of wool.
This is very good for us.
Every night, Penelope, for the past two years, I've made it a point to walk through the park at midnight.
He can make the sound of human footsteps--which is a terrifying sound.
You fool, you fool.
Everything's going to be beautiful.
Is that a fact?
Albert Einstein plays shuffleboard.
Lewis Carroll, who wrote Alice in Wonderland, plays shuffleboard.
We aren't gonna arrest him for that...
Okay. I'll take a half hour.
No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do.  I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
What do you mean?
Just one.
Yeah. He's a nice guy. Don't lose him. Maybe we could tone down this stripe a bit. It's a little...
Are you sure it's all right?
I work with Ramada. We're doing some pictures together.
Are you Niki?
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
And your wife? Where's she?
You really shouldn't eat like that. All that sugar. It's not good for you.
You know what I'm talking about.
Say what?
No.
Out of gratitude for being chosen. That's where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace, to choose Him of your own free will.
It's not quite the same thing.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Grand Rapids? Of course.
Why do you say that?
Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them what three and two are they'll tell you five, but if you ask them what five is, they go blank. That's spec-u-lative reasoning, and that's where I come in.
Dogshit. Worse yet, they don't care.
Andy.
I don't know.
Where is she?
Yeah. Probably.
I ain't cheated you, Pilgrim. This is research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.
I'm only human, you know.
Do the police want to arrest me?
You know, it's possible to buy anything on this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped, killed...  One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named Ratan. He usually isn't in this country.  How'd you hear about him?
Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe money...
Wes, do me a favor.
What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of no Ratan.
Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes there.
Fifty cents admission.
I'm just trying to find...  Who owns this store?
No. I walked up. Don't ride elevators.
Yes.  I'm interested in financing an adult feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.
I've got fifty thousand dollars to invest.
Not exactly...
I thought you were a businessman.
I got a picture here. I want you to tell me where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows anything.
I don't suppose you've ever seen this girl before either? Her name's Kristen, but I suppose you've never seen her?
What's that?
You can fuck off, too.
I want you to take a look at this girl here. She's been in some porn stuff.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
He seems very nice. Is Harold interested in, eh, what's going on? I think it's such a super thing to study. And then, of course, I can always fall back on home ec.
Could I see your registration?
But there is a family resemblance.
What do you see?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Do you sing and dance?
Yearse!
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Harold?
How about some ginger pie?
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
It goes on and on.
What do you think?
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
You don't look eighty.
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
What is it?
Oh, my. We're too late.
No.
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
I <u>think</u> I see it.
Well, I really don't smoke.
Did Confucius say that?
Yes. I haven't lived.  I've died a few times.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming.  Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Look at that sky.  It's so big.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
But they'll put me in jail.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Oh, you weren't scared.
How about some candy floss?
Look at the stars.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Farewell?
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
Oh... That's wonderful... I get an eighty-year-old pallbearer for a daughter-in-law! Be reasonable, Harold! You're dealing with your life! What will people say?!
How do you do?
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
I put a lot of effort into these things.
And a lot of time.
No.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging.  Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for <u>fun</u>? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
Your classmates?
Your studies?
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
How about to slit his throat?
Stay where you are, Harold .
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
He... he loved me.
Well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
Get out of the way.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
O.K. Let's go.
But it's true, he is his own Hell. Just as you are in yours.
Nonsense, I...
He talked about Demons, huh?
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue. One sheet of glass between them and us.
I break it, they see us, Happy Halloween. No more hiding.  Outside. I could be outside --
Hey. Stinky. Kitchen's closed.  Whatcha havin'? Six library guards, raw? Plus belts and boots? Man, you're gonna need some heavy fiber to move that out --
Red. How long was it latched onto you?
This is an important mission, Sgt. Whitman. I hope you realize that.
Sgt. Whitman!! Sgt. Whitman!! May I have a word??
You're wasting our time: There's nothing on this island but sheep and rocks.
If he's here, this is worse than I thought.
Cordon off the area. Something came through.
C'mon -- Rasputin??
These freaks, Trevor, they give me the creeps. And I'm not the only one. You're up for review. You and your petting zoo.
Son. About Rasputin --
"In absentia luci, tenebrae vinciunt..."
I'm in way over my head, I know that much.
Got tired of me?
Sir, may I go first??
You will never fulfill your destiny. You will never understand the power inside you.
-- should go back. Now!
Helping you -- I just --
Myers?
Hey, your chili's getting cold --
Um... Liz -- I -- there's something I'd like you to -- something I need you to hear.
Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this --  But I can't.  I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
It's freezing, isn't it?
That you feel that way about me.
Hit me.
Yes, I --
Christ!
It's my lucky day.
What's happening?
The box... you opened it. We came.
Many times.
Just in time.
Please. Get back into bed.
Well the police are going to want to speak to you. You know that.
Julia!
You bastard --
Bastard.
Well can I come in or not?
What about Larry --
Back from where?
You can't let me stay like this. Please. You can't.
My nerves... are beginning to work again.
-- to heal me completely. Then we can be away from here, before they come looking.
Later.
To experience beyond anything ever known. At least that's what I was promised when I bought it. Pleasure from Heaven or Hell. I didn't much care which.
So where's the harm?
Maybe we should just leave --
What's the problem?
How long since you were here?
You know we have to let Kirsty see this place, before we do anything to it. She'll love it.
You're still blaming me.
All right.
No argument.
Well?
What have you done?
You're NOT going to faint.
Take it slowly.
You're done worse.
I'll be O.K. Just leave me be a while.
Is this upsetting you?
Are you all right?
Oh baby.
Well, isn't it?
Is this your place ?
No personal details?
This isn't the bedroom.
I suppose not.
Oh Christ.
Well, if you change your mind. What's this friend's name?
What did you say?
Well I want you to see the house.
Maybe later in the week. First I've got to find myself a job.
What are you drinking, love?
I guess.
Would you... maybe call round sometime? Try to make friends.
Get the fuck out of here.
All right.  No. That's nice.
Meaning what?
Oh no?
Really?  Married Kevin?  Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that?  None, no chance.  That's just fate.
Play it.
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
Nice, Barry.
Not the point.
Barry, I'm fucking broke!  I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
I wanna date a musician...
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all!  All three of us.
What?
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Don't be sad, Barry.  You'll find true love someday.
Thanks for your support, Rob.  Really appreciate it.
I didn't make up the name.  It's the Steely Dan song.  And it was in The Commitments.
Fuck off, Barry.
Because it's in The Big Chill.
What is she doing?  Okay, 20%.
You couldn't be.  Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums.  How are you going to cope with them?
I'm looking for a record for my daughter.  For her birthday.  "I Just Called To Say I Love You." Do you have it?
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD.  Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables.  But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
What?
No, not nothing.  What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
That's what I said.
A couple blocks!  About six!
Anna Moss.
What are you talking about?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Who?  Oh.  My friend.  My friend is Laura.  A girl.  A friend who's a girl.
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
'Morning, Dick.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
What's this?
Are you all right?
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
Rob.
Rob --!
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
What needs sorting out?
So you weren't interested in music at all?
But Laura... that's me.  That's all there is to me.  There isn't anything else.  If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
I suppose so.
No problem.  If I can ask one question.
You won't like it.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
So, how are you?
Will you call me?
I figured it was.  Where are you?
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
Hello.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store?  Ian.  In Starbuck's.  Neat, huh?
You're soaking.
What do you mean?
Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
What?
I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
Mission accomplished.
Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
Where?
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I know.
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
No.  Probably not.
So?
About what?
I'm an idiot.  I should have played the record first.  This place is about to get burned down.
Rob here.
What's happenin'.
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
You're kidding.  A crematorium? Jesus.
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing.  A relief, actually.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers?  Nobody's heard the Crumblers.  Except me.
So you'll stay?
Would you like me to turn the lights out?  Or would you like them on?
How would I know?  Gone.  Girlfriend. Leave.  Not say where gone.  Laura move out.
I knew this would happen.  What are you going to do Rob?
I knew this was going to happen.
What did Laura say?  Do you know why she left?
So you say.  I'd like to hear her side of it.
What do you think?
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred?  They're worth five times that.
We saw this ad in the personals for two swingers lookin' for a Renaissance fair.
Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
No.
Poor little tyke didn't have a chance.  Hopelessly premature.  He died a few days after he was born.
-Okay okay.
Jesus Christ.
I left a man dead in Felton.  But you don't really care, do you?
I'd rather hear yours.
What's all that?
You make it all sound so simple.
I don't know any of these.  I'll make a fool of myself.
Then you must be at least 70 years old.
It's frightening sometimes the way you talk about other people's lives.
I've been telling myself it's the award winning journal article I'm going to write.  But it's not.  It's you.
Who are you?
He is older than I.
Not the same.
What is it like?  Being you?
The emptyness.  The years and years of void.  Nothingness.  Bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. Who would have guessed?
Forget it.
Aren't you getting a little old for this?  You flunked out of law school.
A murder.
I have witnesses that can put the two of you together.
Someone should check him out. Maybe a collection somewhere got knocked over.  He has one, he might have two.
Requiem acer'nam donaei-
Stop.
Aye.
Your marks would suggest great injury.
Do you ever feel a flow, as if some- thing were pushing against you?
Conor, you and I, we cannot be killed.
Listen to me.  Hear the words.
It is the truth.
You are not dead, boy.  Accept it.
There's rumor in the village. Some call it magic.
That's wonderful.  Where did you ever learn it?
Not so scared.
Finish your prayers?
I understand you joined up in Bremen.
Equals?
You see Major?  You are not so different...
I want people in here to check over every piece of this stuff.
Round up who you can and put them on standby.
Smith.  Carl Smith.
_Answer_ me.
Spare a chair?
Are you going to offer me a chair or leave me standing here all night?
How are you?
Old habits die hard.  Waitress!  A round of Nitzhic!  Peasant drool, I know.  But it's the closest thing they stock to my side of the fence.
And have you something to settle with me?
Tasting and enjoying life is the only thing of value we have.  All else is just marking time.  You're marking time.
The pressure only comes when you let the taste slip into your mouth.
We have some unfinished business.
Yes laddie, I have her.
This your present address?
Did you know the victim?
What were _you_ looking for?
Do you know what this is?
A claymore to be exact.  You wouldn't know anything about it would you?
Home.
The resemblance is amazing.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Who is it?
Ain't you got any more sense than to -- ?  Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here.
Remember the ending?  " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..."
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
All right.  One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Did you finish the interview?
Hildy!
Did you give her the money?
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
Anything the matter?
I'm beginning to realize that.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
Call Duffy!
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
What do you want?
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
Sure you can. Come on.
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Then what does he want with you?
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
You said it.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
Now you're talking!
What tricks would I pull?
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies!  By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over.  Give me Duffy!
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Railroad tickets.
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
Who?  Hello, Butch! Where are you?
Oh, for --  H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Then why are you doing it?
Where'd you wire him?
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
You know me. The shirt off my back.
Here's that certified check, Walter.  I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man!
Hello, Hildy! What are you doing around here?
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization.
I don't know --
You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that?
Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams?
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him.  Gimme the desk.
Hold the phone!
We know what you're up to.
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
What went off?
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Shoot to kill, I said.
And so do I!
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Any news?
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone.
Look out, you --
Have you got my dough?
Here!
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Hiding him where?
Mother!
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Earl, you must never do that again.
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you. 
Where are they gone? You know where they are?
They'll get him! They'll get him!
What's the idea?
Hey --
What's from the Governor?
Who? Me?
But how do I know...?
You forgot to tell me what a City Sealer has to do.
They wouldn't take it.
Here's the picture of my wife.
She's good enough for me! And if I was to go home and tell my wife --
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
What's your hurry?
Baldwin -- his name is.
The door was locked.
Never let a rat creep up on you.
Give him the you-know-what.
It's true.
Pauline's mum got killed.
That word is special. That word is only for something really important. Now, repeat after me... Bugger off.
They pulled them up from all the crossroads, so when the Germans land they'll lose their way.
You wouldn't.
Go and ask her if she wants to play.
Bruce, look! Dad got some German jam.
You're the biggest fibber.
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
You said that last year, Dad.
Who pays for them?
Take it away. I know your husband's been away a long time, but....
Boy, that was some air-raid.
I don't understand. Is there any point to it?
So you're going to be a grandfather.
Has Sue got it right?
You know it? It must be an old one.
He always knows.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
...such nice boys with straw boaters and blazers. All the punts lit up with Chinese lanterns. Like fireflies. And the gramophone going on one of the boats. Always the Charleston, the Charleston, the Charleston. Oh, you girls.
It was the best time of his life.
I can't do it. What's the point?
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
I wish it could all have been different.
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
I didn't mean it like that, Grace. Why does it always come out wrong?
Molly!
Yeah, it's a tree. I used to play there all the time. But, you can't find it without me. Outsider can't find no deadwood.
Cone.
The lions were totally covered in this guy's blood... I think they ate his face off, tore open his rib cage, pulled his legs off... it was a wild scene.
I agree.
I'll cut your fucking tits off and shove 'em down your throat.
Drink up, it's party time.
Who's your Daddy!
OK, whatever. Let's go get your brother's truck. Faster we get the truck, faster we get out of here.
How much further?
Christ, you scared the shit out of me.
Is your brother ready to go?
So, you live here alone... I mean with just your brother?
Hey, um...  ...what kind of animal is that?
That's not something to joke about.
What?
Do you believe this fucking girl?
You all having a Halloween party tonight?
Yeah, yeah...  ...I like to fuck shit up.
Actually it's G. Ober... Gerry Ober, but the guys drew in the other O, fucking assholes.
Keep the change and get yourself a new name.
But suppose for a second you did.
As far a hot... goes I gotta go with... Ruth Ann Moorehouse.
I'll let it slide, she was only seventeen.
Perfect.
Really fucking awesome.
Tire's fucking gone crap on us, man. There's no saving it now.
Almost there.
Yeah, I'd say at this point all we can do is just wait it out. There's nothing else.
Don't look back, just get in the car.
Sounds like a magical trip through the heartland.
Why are we stopping?
How much is a person supposed to stand?
Come on, get with the facts.
Shit, this ain't worth nothing now that my name gotten all over it. I was a fixin' on trading it to Jackie Cobb.
I'm sure that ain't the only place he's sticking those pencils.
Yeah, now there's the perfect woman.
Fuck your grandmother.
How long is that gonna take?
Yeah, my poor baby. It's his Daddy's fault. I mean Earl was a good man... I mean he never hit me or nothing, but one day he just got up and went pure devil on us all.
Great, you're back. Let's go. We already paid for the tickets.
Hey, maybe she knows where this is?
Yeah, so how does that fit with the story of four morons with a flat tire looking for a dead tree?
You know what Jerry, who really cares at this point?
Hey, nice outfit Billy Bob.
I can't... I can't move my arms. I hurt so much.
That was good babe, just keep doing that.
Oh yeah, yeah I've driven by that place before. I seem to remember a crabby old bastard in a crummy clown suit running the place.
Come on sleeping beauty, time to go to work.
Too late. You're in for life, let's move it out Private Shutterbug.
I swear I've aged five years since this trip started.
I don't hear anything.
A couple hours!
Shit, I wonder what these kids did to bring this much hell down on 'em.
Oh, really...  ...well, I'm a pretty good dancer if you know what I mean... I bet I got a few moves you ain't never seen.
Bye sweety, we could of been great together.
I'll go. It's my fault.
Hold on, hold on! Everybody calm down! It's the tow truck guy.
OK lassies, I think it's time you get to gripping reality.
I'm with Denise, can't we just walk to someplace, this is getting fucking stupid.
Why? Why are you doing this?
Where's Bill?
Behold... The Fish-Boy!
Aw, you ain't disturbing me, but it kind of looks like rain, don't ya think?
Otis! Otis! Come quick, there's cops outside.
I don't know. I only saw one.
Get in... now!
Christ, four kids couldn't just disappear.
Fuck, go to the car... call for backup. Tell 'em officer down.
Well, we were on our way out to run a check on a couple farmhouses out on the edge of town... closest thing we got to a lead at this point.
You know, your hyper sensitive Spidey senses... like Spider-man...  ...you know, like in the comics.
And furthermore... Tell him, Harold.
And?
You remind me so much of Nathan.
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
Let's go eat, I'm starved.
Shall we close up, then?
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
What is wrong, my darling?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please.  Lila.
Yeah. Okay. Be home around seven. Bye.  What? I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do?
Gabby, what is it?
What is it?
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
Lila?
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
Nice night.
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
That's what I'm counting on.
Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt.
Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you.
Oh?
Be still my crotch.
And I'm going to miss the lifestyle having you as a client has afforded me.
I like you so much, with or without hair.  But don't spread that around. Bad for business.
Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read.
Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond.
Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course.
The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
It's just that I have some peculiarities, and...
I don't know. Something.
You'll catch cold. It's cold.  What do you suppose he is, a survivalist?
Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject.
What are you doing in there?
Who is it?
So, how's it going today?
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Such as my man and how to please him!  Such as making wonderful dinners for my man!  Such as looking pretty for my man!  And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
So he's doing okay?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
Shut up!  I gave you... life. I created you in my image, Puff. I took you from this primordial ooze and brought you into the world of culture and art and manners. And this is how you repay me? By heading back to the ooze first chance you get? I should leave you here with Lila the ape woman. It would serve you right, you ungrateful piece of crap. But I'm not going to. You're too valuable to me. Totally selfish of me. You serve my purpose. But if you had any smarts you would realize that I serve your purpose as well. Life is so much more delightful when lived in a silk suit.
Good-eve-n-ing-lay-dees-and-gent- elmen.
This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem.
Extra dessert?
Thanks to you, Nate.
And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support.
I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis?
Comin' in or goin' out?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
Do you really think you can beat him?
Only when I work.
Pool.
He drank as much whisky as you did.
That's your problem.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
For me.
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
I'll beat him the next game.
Please don't get off me now.
Half.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
He's my partner.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award.  No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Why?
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
Whaddya mean?
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
It's quiet.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
How much we got?
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
Is this all we got left?
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
Who's he?
Gimme ten bucks.
You quittin' too?
You better not miss, friend.
How long have you been waiting?
Just a cup of black coffee, please...  Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute!  Would you, uh, like another cup?
You don't look like a college girl.
So why go to college?
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
Why did you do that?
Why?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
You got it all in your head?
You going out?
What are you writing?
No. You?
He knows. A lot.
He's a gambler.
You glad?
What do you want to tell me?
No, I want to walk.
Oh, grow up.
Fifty-seven.
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
Where do you come from?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Very good shot.
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
I came to play pool, Fats.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
Yes.
You want to find them.
What choice did I have -- ?!
I only protect myself -- !
Do you still want me to stay?
You have to go.  He'll never stop. Leave this place.  Find another.
Tell me about the interesting people you met, won't you?
You and that damned garden.
Only got one kind.
So, what do you do?
Wow.  Look at the mountains.
A meteorite, Dad, look!
There are more this year than last.
Are you sure you saw that?  In the rain -- it may have <u>looked</u> like it changed shape --
Are you all right, Dad?
I have to go over to the town this morning and do a lot of shopping. This house needs just <u>everything</u>. I'll probably be gone all day. Jimmy, hurry up and eat or you'll be late.
What happened to you?  Who was that?
I'm home now.
Yes, I do, Mr. Gardner.
This is a new town for you.  Do you like it here?
Where, Jimmy?
I swear it was here.
They'll get us.
Does it look to you like anything landed here?
No one comes here after dark.
What do you think he saw?  Could it have been something from the air base?
George, where have you been?
Hi.  Sorry I'm late.
When?
I have school.
Jimmy's father is on the phone.  I wonder if you'd take the call.
Penicillin. At least it will help keep his fever down.
In case you haven't noticed, we're in a little bit of a crisis here.
What?
And when is the countdown supposed to expire?
You can't be seriously considering firing nuclear weapons?
David thought I was having an affair, which I wasn't.
You saved a lot of lives.
A countdown to what?
It's the White House, for crying out loud. You can't just drive up and ring the bell.
And you're going to educate them? Tell me something, you're so smart how come you spent eight years at M.I.T. to become a cable repairman?
Sure he'll listen. Why wouldn't he?
You punched the President in the face?
Pops, you're a genius!
We're loose!
Is my wife in the air?
Organize every plane you can find and get some Goddamned pilots to fly them.
We have confirmed divisions of troops from different armies all around the world. Most of Europe, the Middle East and Asia are battle ready.
Get on the horn with Atlantic Command. Let's upgrade the situation to DEFCON 3.
Organize a military escort to Crystal Mountain.
More ships keep arriving, fifteen in total so far.
You can't go. Call them back.
Really? You don't mind?
You're late.
Was his father stationed here?
So, what do you do for a living?
Dylan, come here. I want you to meet the First Lady.
I don't need it.
But I gave you some this morning.
They let you out?
We're leaving, don't try and stop us.
Troy's still my son no matter how you feel about me.
How' he doing?
Mr. President?
Call them back.
What do you want us to do?
Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you... have you arranged our supplies?
You know how long I've been looking for that?!
Your treat.
Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus -- you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."  But where exactly?
Marcus!
The Word of God...
Are you expected?
My name is Donovan. Walter Donovan.
"Where the cup that holds the blood of Jesus Christ resides forever."
An old man's dream.
We've hit a snag. Our project leader has vanished. Along with all his research. Uh, we received a cable from his colleague, Doctor Schneider, who has no idea of his whereabouts or what's become of him.  I want you to pick up the trail where he left off. Find the man and you will find the Grail.
Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
I'm through!
Fraulein -- will you permit me?
I usually don't either.
It would make me very happy.
Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
At least I let you tag along.
No. You like the way I do things.
This book contained a map -- a map with no names -- precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
It's important!
I'll never forgive myself --
Dad, they come in through the doors.
Found it.
Well, what was left of him.
Alexandretta.  It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
...you did it.
They want my diary.
Dad!
Come on, Dad. Come on!
My Diary's in Berlin.
Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
Three devices of such lethal cunning.
Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
Marcus would agree with me.
Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self-reliance.
What does that mean?
I didn't know you could fly a plane.
Dad, are we hit?!
Those people are trying to kill us!
"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I".
Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
Uh-huh.
Get that camel out of the way!
Sallah, I said no camels! That's five camels. Can't you Count?
You're hanging on better here than you did in America.
I'm sure it's nothing. Just rumors.  What was it they claimed was stolen?
Rather bizarre menu, wouldn't you say?
I've spent by life crawling around in caves and tunnels -- I shouldn't have let somebody like Willie go in there with me.
Then she must have run out of the room and you found her.
I believe we're being called to dinner.
Jones isn't in his room. Miss Scott -- my troops are leaving at dawn if you want us to escort you to Delhi --
What?
Who?
Listen, Mr. Lal, what do you call the Maharajah's wife?
I was dubious myself at first. Then something connected -- the village's rock and the old legend of the Sankara Stones...
You understand what he tells us?
So, it is true, Dr. Jones? You found Nurhachi?
What's that?
Indy, look!
This is Nainsukh -- from the village. They bring him here to dig in the mines.
Come one, what's wrong?
No, the stones are mine!
On the way to Delhi, you will stop at Pankot.
It is why Krishna brought you here.
I'll take the extra ticket.  Where's this plane going anyway?
So, what're you supposed to be, a lion tamer?
Listen, Willie. Do exactly what I tell you now.
Yes, stroke it right along the maxillary and precaudal vertebrae.
By the way, how'd you end up in Shanghai?
I think you should sleep closer.  I meant for safety.
Yeah -- and nothing else.  That shock you?
We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open.
There's a hole! I found a square hole!
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
So now they believe me.
I guess Mola Ram got what he wanted.
Give me your hat...
I don't appreciate being cooked like a french fry!
My name is AL.
Who?
Al.
You're in my head...
Your name is Al...
No...no...it's nothing.. Rehearsing a play...  What light through yonder window breaks...It is Al... and he's in my head.
You're in my head? You don't know my name?
What??? You lose your lease on a condo?
Yeah...Who?
You've heard of U.S.T.?
Why he's argumentative?
You'll be alive.
Anyone there?
Behind us?
A lab and equipment.
I was thirsty. He told me to get a drink.
Oh my God...What did he look like, the man?
You need ID in there?
Wait a minute. The fight. Where did he get you?
I'm back.
What is it?
What do we do?
I don't have any.
It's illegal.
What's wrong with how I carry myself.
The beach?
It's sand.
Beautiful!
She doesn't seem to understand.
Help me out, will you?
What do I do?
What?
.
Without your pants.
You stumbled around. Remember, you've got my ID, you've got to be me, not some stumblebum.
Get close to them.
Follow that busboy.
Just don't show fear.
Voice stress analyzer.
Even Rene?
What is it, your charm?
What Happened?
Ahhh...works...Ryuji... travel...just business...She's.. Fine Arts, University of Tokyo..
Some agent you are.
Don't you think I stand out like this.
What do I do?
Beer. And cakes...cookies ..anything bad.
What are you doing? Wait a minute. Lets think this through.
What?
Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
It's in the watch. He lead us on that chase while Dieter brought the chip into Hong Kong.
What happened?
Be quiet.
Dieter asked where I was. He expected me here. Maybe someone was assigned to bring me here.
JOE What abilities...?
No!
I didn't do anything.
I knew you were trouble.
How about a deal?
Bit expensive, sir.
What are you doing here, where've you been?
Well, I'm glad to see you. Sorry things broke up like that.
...Foreign service.
It may have been affected.
When you remember...
Don't you want to get out?
Al?
Ahhh...nothing.
Was quite excited, when he came in...
Don't do it!
Yes...What is it?
Oh...and who is it!?
The poet...something he said...
What's so funny?
What way?
Wait. What's your name?
I guess it's a combination you don't often see. Apparent attraction..
Can I help?
I promise you that. I am not crazy. Course, if I was, I'd be the last to know. Why do you ask?
But I don't listen...then I'd be crazy.
Why?
Your friends, did they ask about me?
He didn't.
Who did?
I'm not worried, I'm not going to eat it.
This business is over.
You know where he went?
He stole something. From a friend of mine.
The most important one. Can you help me find him?
Where we going?
This boat doesn't go anywhere. Just toots around the Inland Sea.
What?
That must be him. Water taxi.
That's not this direction. It's back the other way.
I know the territory.
Why not?
What happened?
Are you alright?
How?
You son of a bitch! You conned me!
It wasn't me. It was him.
Joe Doakes? It's quarter to 10...
Is there anything else?
You can't take that.
It will be fine. You have another.
Right there.
The other working.
I'll take some.
He's into kind of little cars, that...
Three hours.
Well, are you or are you not, Charlie?
Are you suggesting that she and Eric are influenced by money?
So, what are you going to do?
I'm staying right here. Doing my job. Fighting to get my show on the air. You don't like it? Hey, I'll tell you what... fire my ass...
No, not that. I'm talking about the Associated Press. They got this story that we pulled this interview and they talked to Mike and I. Did you tell them that we were lying?
That's happening. And, hopefully we won't have to use the alternate, but we should have it in the can.
So, now, if you'll excuse me, gentlemen, Mr. Rather's been complaining about his chair again.  As they start to leave...
Do you have a history of emotional problems, Mr. Wigand?
I'm gonna do a follow-up.
Mike... Mike... Mike...
Is CBS corporate telling CBS News do not go to air with this story?
Here's how it works. You ask me questions. I tell you if you're wrong.
Why?
You ready...?
I can take her.
Is there any more rice...?
What do you need at the store?
There's a severance agreement... It includes cash payouts over time and continuing medical coverage...  Sure you don't need anything?
Use the bathroom.
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Will independent sources corroborate that?
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
What are you and Mike going to do?
Yes, I'm right here. Could you call me back on a hard line?
Area code 212-555-0199.
It would be better if he called us.
Yeah, I'm here.
...come in earlier on Mike's Marine barracks line when he's talking to Sheikh Mussawi...
Well, it isn't "cigarettes are bad for you"...
So, is everything okay?
It went great in Mississippi, Mike.
Lowell.
I've been banished. In lieu of being fired.
Yeah.
I disappeared on you?
How many shows have we done? Huh? C'mon, how many?
That Canada story? Still interest you?
Tell him I will see him day after tomorrow.
...protect your sources...! You screwed me! You sold me out!
C'mere. I want to talk to you.
I've always thought of myself... as a man of science. That's what's wrong with it.
No, you said you were going to call me tomorrow. So, what about?
Next to your father?
Why?
I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials...
Excuse me. Yeah...
You attract a crowd.
B & W may have threatened litigation... CBS is on the block...  But you, I mean, I know how...
No? No, what?
I've got to teach class. I've got to go. I've got to teach class.
You manipulated me into this...!
Did he hear you?
Jeffrey, how are you? How's the family, okay?
What do you mean there is no family?
Mike's our Attorney General down here.  I was just explaining to Jeff, they got a Kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.
And that's what cigarettes are for...?
The straw that broke the camel's back for me and really put me in trouble with Sandefur was a compound called "coumarin." When I came on board at B&W, they had tried to transition from coumarin to a similar flavor that would give the same taste, and had been unsuccessful. I wanted it out immediately. I was told that it would affect sales, so I should mind my own business. I constructed a memo to Mr. Sandefur indicating I could not in conscience continue with coumarin in a product that we now knew, we had documentation, was similar to coumadin, a lung-specific carcinogen...
Poor communication skills.
Dr. Wigand. I am instructing you...  ...not to answer that question in accordance to the terms of the contractual obligations undertaken by you not to disclose any information about your work at the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. And in accordance with the force and effect of the temporary restraining order that has been entered against you to by the court in the State of Kentucky! That means you don't talk!  Mr. Motley, we have rights, here...
Baby. You are so HOT!
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
I don't need it.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
You're in check.
What?
Is she Asian?
I have it.
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
Is Tong older than Ming?
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
I assume this is on Rex?
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
What is it you're after, Miles?
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Getting married.
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Yes? Marylin?
Marylin? When did I say...?
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
Is that you?
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
Apparently she was very disappointed.
And here I thought my mother was...
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
You do?
No.
But?
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
I have a surprise for you.
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
STUFF.  Got a light?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Murder!
Rex. Get away from the door.
I was devastated. Of course.
Miles Massey.
Do you know him?
Lilly's up.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
You're not...
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
What?
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
Mr. Rexroth.
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
In anticipation of making you sick.
And she has...?
Wrigley!
What do you think?
She owes me a meal.
Yes.  It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Three is not Farrow.
How is she?
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
South America!
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
What've you got against King Westley?
You only met him once .
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
might have been able to help if it weren't for you. I've been watched so closely, I—
It's my daughter! Go after her.
Ellie? Oh, she's no responsibility.
What would you like to have me do?
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me—and maybe we'll be friends—  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
We've done that already.
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston.  "Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
No.
Whadda you want!
Okay! Okay! Keep your shirt on, young feller. 
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
That storm sure made a mess outa these roads.
I beg your pardon!
Tell that man not to drive so fast. 
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Of course I do. What do you mean—
Hey, Brat—!  The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
This?  Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments. 
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first—then the tie—then the shirt—now, according to Hoyle,[5] the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different.  go for the shoes first. After that I—
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
Like what?
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough—we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."[8]
After that "The Three Musketeers."  I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
It takes money to buy food.
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
Aren't you afraid of me?
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation—a warm heart—and a loving nature.
Not a one.
Peter—
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
Sure.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
Carrots.
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
Number two is a wider movement—a smile goes with that one—like this.  That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.[12]
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
You! Don't make me laugh.
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13]
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Any luck?
I hope you got your money.
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited—
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you?
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
No harm in your coming to see us.
You bet we did.
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
Sorry—I didn't mean to—
Up yonder. See the lights?
Did you know he reversed the charges on that call?
Okay, Joe. Listen—you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn—anytime I ran into a story that looked good—I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
If it's on the level.
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute.  I'm in love with her, Joe.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
What?
Funny couple, ain't they?
A trumpet?
Mush. Mush.
There you go—trustin' people again. How many times did I tell you—
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you?  Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
Sh-sh-sh—! Soft pedal, you mug!—before I— What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it!  Now listen, you're in this thing—and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
Susie, watch the language, would you please.
Gentlemen, I will not hear this.  I value Bill as much as anyone here.  We all need to make room for someone else's ideas, Lou, especially me. Maybe Oswald is what everyone says he is and I'm just plain dumb wrong.
Why you keep dancing on my head for, my man?  We been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.
There you go.  Grain of salt.  Two sides to every coin.
Yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, Deano.  You shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.
And Oswald?
Of course there weren't. 'Cause they disappeared.  And yet the Commission found you, Dean.
All this blubbering over that sonofabitch!  They're grieving like they knew the man.  It makes me want to puke.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan.  Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia.  That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it.  As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed.  I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that.  It gets weirder.
Bill.
It's you I want to talk to, Bill.
Who do you think fed him that information?  Garrison's going down. We're talking your career here, Bill, your life.  You're a young guy... we know you're working that Castro thing.
It's addressed to no one and no signature.  "To leave this life is, for me, a sweet prospect.  I find nothing in it that is desirable and on the other hand, everything that is loathsome."
Clay Bertrand?  Sure I know him.  He comes around the Quarter.
Shaw.  Clay Shaw.
Clay Bertrand, Willie?
But why?
I still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss.  Susie's stuff is colorful, but...
Nick, what would happen if a man suffering from hypertension were to take an entire bottle of Proloid?
...ever called Dean Andrews?
You still questioning any Cubans?
...give me protection?
Come in, Dave.  Have a seat, make yourself comfortable.  Coffee?
Oh, it was just a spur of the moment thing...  the storm wasn't that bad.
Yes, now I remember, Mr. Garrison. I'm sorry, I got confused.  We got out there near the geese and it was only then we realized we'd forgotten our shotguns.  Stupid, right?  So of course we didn't get any geese.
Why?  What's wrong?
You mean about the Cubans getting trained north of the lake?
Let me get this straight, now.  Clay Shaw is blackmailing you?
And Shaw?
What about Ruby?
No.
I can't believe you're saying this in the courtroom.
Dad, look what I drew.
Look, we can put you in a mental institution.  We can make you look crazier'n Marguerite Oswald, and everybody knows how crazy she is.
If we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. Blow up right in our face.  Ruby was just given a new trial.  If he has something to say, it'll be there. Susie, what did you find out on Oswald?
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
This is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the Pacific!  He should've been prosecuted as a traitor!
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas/Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes.  Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program.  He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
I don't believe it!
I think Clinton is a breakthrough. Shaw denies he knows Ferrie or Oswald. Is that right?  It proves he's a liar.  Keep on it, Bill. 
I'm not sure I understand.
Perhaps a few more details about the evening will refresh your memory. Mr. O'Keefe told us dinner was served by a uniformed waiter - a colored man.  He particularly remembers that you sat at one end and he at the other - which he found rather unusual because the table was so long.  Does that bring back memories of Willie O'Keefe?
I would imagine a uniformed waiter helps.
After dinner you paid him to have sex with you.
No, it was not.  Do you know an attorney by the name of Dean Andrews?
Mr. Shaw, can you identify this man?
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim?  Jim, dinner.
Honey, you all right? 
No.  I told you I was going to talk to Shaw.
My sympathies.
Nothing is going to happen to you. I won't let it.
Just a crank making phone calls. Happens a dozen times a day at the office.
Only cowards make crank calls, sweetheart, nothing is going to happen.
Get a hold of yourself.
Honey, come on.  The government wants you to be scared.  They want everybody to be scared to speak out.  They count on it.  But there's nothing to be scared of.
And if you're wrong?
He won... and they killed Robert Kennedy.  They shot him down.
You realize the things you're saying, Willie, are going to be attacked by a lot of different people.
No one's trying to buy you, Willie. It's important to know why you're telling us this.
Remember whose office this was back in '63?  531 Lafayette Street.
Bill, Lou, we're standing in the heart of the United States Government's intelligence community in New Orleans.  That's the FBI there, the CIA, Secret Service, ONI.  Doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a Communist to spend his spare time?
You don't get it, guys - he can't go down any further.  We got to protect him full time.
I took it once for a low thyroid condition...  It raises the metabolism, Lou.  Did David Ferrie strike you as the kind of person who had a low metabolism?
Earle Cabell.  And guess who his brother is?
His boss was the one on the Warren Commission who handled all the leads to the intelligence community.
Hell, you're the District Attorney. You read the Warren Report - and then you tell me you're satisfied Lee Oswald shot the President all by his lonesome.
Welcome, District Attorney Garrison. May I call you Jim?
There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury.  What is your response?
Pictures like this don't show up on television!
Jim Garrison?
I'm glad you came.  I'm sorry about the precautions.
I could give you a false name, but I won't.  Just call me X.
The size of this is... beyond me. Testify?
I haven't yet.  I don't have much of a case.
You never ask a spook a question. No point.  He'll never give you a straight answer.  General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
And he never hit you before?
How much more?
Dave Ferrie - you know about him?
Anyone else involved at Banister's level?
Didn't someone say he didn't speak good Russian?
Sure sounds like he's winning.
Welcome, Mr. Miller.  Jim Garrison. Would you care for some coffee?
You were lucky.  I spent three years in the Pacific.  I've never seen an avenue with such a profusion of bail-bonding companies. Why is that?
I know about that shot.  A terrible tragedy.  How much do you have for carrying on your investigation?
I'm going to be very frank with you. You've done a great job, an astounding job considering the limited resources available to you.  But the best you can ever hope for is to stir up a lot of confusion.  You're not going to do this country any good, and you're not going to do yourself any good.  You don't belong here.  On this Mickey Mouse street with that cheap strip of bail bond shops.
Stop your investigation... it was a magnificent effort but it's over and done with.  The press is already on your behind and that's only the beginning, my boy, only the beginning.
And you get of from school at 3 every day?
What the fuck can I say? I'm serious, man. What the fuck can I say? Thank you... thank you... thank you.
What'd ya mean?
Answer the question, nigga. Do you think I wanted to spend the thousand dollars on your ass? Yes or no?
You got a good lawyer?
Great, you're here.
What's she want?
The envelope contains currency... all the same denomination, one-hundred- dollar bills. Now, I'm counting it.
Can we stop for cigarettes?
I don't think so.
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender.  I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
He's the one who wants you.
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Want to hear some music?
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
Well, hello.
I walked right past you.
"American President"
You talk them into it?
I see.
You're avoiding the question.
What do you do when he comes home?
Did you do it that night?
How'd you find out?
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
I thought you were tired of your business?
What if I plead guilty?
He say we like the same thing as married.
Most of the times.
Then how do you know he sells guns?
How can you help us?
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
...Compton with a fifty-six-year- old petty thief -- woman named Simone Hawkins.
Not yet.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
Uh-huh.
She didn't say.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
What did you do after that?
Louis Gara's dead. L.A.P.D. found him dead in a car on Ninth. And we've lost Ordell.
Uh-uh.
How the fuck they know that?
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Plus the same deal as before.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
I was there, I saw her do it.
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
Four years?
With Ordell?
C'mon, don't lie.
Yeah, that really hit the spot.
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
He went to meet that stewardess.
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
We're leaving now!
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
See, what did I tell you? Man in New York wants a 9 millimeter Smith and Wesson Model 5946. Why does he want it? It's the gun that nigga on "New York Undercover" uses. Because of that nigga, I can sell it to this nigga for twelve-fifty.
Uh-huh.
How much is there?
I don't hafta trust her, I know her.
Uh-huh.
It's Louis.
I got it. Listen, there's something else I have to tell you.
You keep drivin' down Ninth, to where they got all them car dealerships. We're gonna leave this heap in a parking lot and get one the cops don't know about.  Hey, where's Melanie?
You shot Melanie?
Where did you shoot her?
Then what?
'fore I blow that bitch's brains out, I'll ask her.
You know who I saw in the dress department?
They don't have your winning personality.
That's Winston. He works here.
Yeah.
Who's it for? A relative?
He takes off and I gotta go to Kentucky to bring him back, you pay the expenses.
Comfortable?
It still sounds high.
Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out -- hey, that rhymes -- blew Beaumont's brains out.
Brown, Jackie Brown.
If there's no -- what do you call it -- confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything?
The bond collateral on Beaumont Livingston you moved over to cover Miss Brown, remember?
I'm alone.
We're back.
Hello.  Hey, Jackie...  No, Jackie, I didn't get your message.
What do you want?
Do you want some help? I can call upstairs.
You're hurting me!
Well, try, huh.
Things happen? What the fuck are you talking about? They did something to us, Frank. We have to expose this.
Shit! You know it's not half the case if I go it alone. We're all suffering the same symptoms, Frank. The army is to blame. They've done something to us. How can you not want to know?
Hey, wait!
I'm sorry, Mr. Singer, but do you have any idea how many people come to me with the injustices of the world? It'd break your heart.
The army. The army. What is it with you guys? We're not talking about a trip to the library here. This is the United States Government for God's sake. This is red tape coming out of your ass. You know what I mean?
I'm too messed up to teach.
Listen, will you listen? They're trying to get me. They're comin' out of the walls. The army's done something to me. I need you.
You mind? I'm eating, huh?
I talked to the Army's Bureau of Records. You've never even been to Viet Nam.
It means that you and your buddies are whacko, that you were discharged on psychological grounds after some war games in Thailand.
Bullshit. Someone's covering somethin'. That was no accident.
What do you mean, demons?
He was scared. He saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. They were tryin' to get him, he said.
You think they're connected?
Come on, Jake. That didn't hurt.
Turn on your right side.  How about the other "right?"  I don't understand you philosphers. You've got the whole world figured out but you can't remember the difference between right and left.
Ah!
Jacob, if it was any other brain but yours, I might agree.  Tell me, does your lady friend know what a brilliant thinker, what a sub- lime intellect she's living with?
I know very little about demons, Ja- cob, fleshy ones anyway. I know them as literary figures, biblical ones ... Dante, Milton ... but Jacob,  this is the 20th Century. We don't see demons now.
Look. I don't pretend to know what's going on inside your head. For all I know it's pathological and they should be pumping Valium into your veins by the quart. But if you're not willing to accept the help of sci- ence; and believe me, I admire you for that: then you'll have to do bat- tle on your own. What can I say? It's a lonely pilgrimage through our times even for the strongest souls. But to be pursued by ... demons no less ... There are no guides, Jacob.  You wanna know what I'd do if I sud- denly started seeing demons? I'd hail the first taxi that came along, shoot over to Bellvue and beg them for shock treatment. I'm no saint.
What was that?
Where are you?
That help?
What happened to you?
Where'd you leave 'em?
Thanks.  What's that?
What?
Is that the one who died?
You okay?
Oh, come on. It's early.
What's it say? A hundred and two?
What does it say?
What the hell are you doin'?
Don't gimme that.
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind.  Love me a little?
While you were in the shower.
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
I'm not here. You haven't seen me.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this?  Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Are you out of your mind?
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
You come here often?
Don't worry. Take it. It'll free your head. Come on.
Here. I've got every credit card ever printed. Take this. Stay here till you can arrange to get away. It's on me.
What? You want the Plaza? Don't be foolish. Here. Take this, too.  This is my place on Prince Street. It's got my phone, everything. Call if you need me ... but you won't. Everything's gonna work out. You just get outta town as fast as you can. The New York police can be effective when they want to be.
You got a nice tan, though.
Dream on!
Push 'em back.
We're doing everything we can.
Lennox Hospital.
You look awake to me. Here.  Drink some of this.
The army?
What about your girlfriend? You don't think she'll mind?
A car accident.
Is he all right?
You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
Asshole that does not count as a kill.
I don't have all day, kid.
Duck fuckers?
Forget the bridge, the shuttle's waiting!
Just make a break for the door. He'll get some of us, but that's the breaks.
Remember, stay calm, use your thrusters. We'll be fine.
You see that?
Shit!
Hey! I'm not ready.
Goodbye, my love.
I'd say we have about ten minutes tops.
Earth II.
ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends.
Got it! Let's move out girls. Yllo go to Lab two and cover out backs.
Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
I doubt that. I think we can handle whatever your ancient hockey player can throw at us.
You just need to relax. Rizzo ti's the future. We have soldiers on board, E-X Grunts, the baddest of the bad...and their weapons? I'm sure are slightly more advanced than what you're used to.
We're screwed!
What if you miss?
Rizzo?!
Did you like it?
It's time.
God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
Now hold on! We should hear her out!
It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up!
Oh, shit. He's going to see us.
Hey teach! This rock's starting to freeze! Get your ass back hre!
Look ice chip, why don't you just chill out and let us handle this?
Boeman don't. You know I'm right.
No.
I don't know...sorry?
It's just you and me, then.
Kay-Em, you okay?
Kay-em you okay?
The power's back up!
You son of a bitch, you know what time it is?
Hypothetically, how much are we talking?
How did I get here, how did you bring me back?
Nano...but nanotechnology is impossible.
Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
That's ridiculous. You're overreacting.
You're not going anywhere.
So, you're saying thse guys have like, lasers and stuff? They could hack him to pieces?
Guys, he's right behind us!
My cars. And a comic book.
And, uh, a case of apricot brandy and you buy the lunch.
Why don't we go in? Get another crack at him tomorrow.
He's trying to sink us!
He's chasing us! I don't believe it.
How come the sun didn't used to shine in here?
Home... New York?
Colorful, isn't he?
Now tell me something I don't know.
Larry, if you'd see these clowns leave, you'd never believe they'd come back with anything. But they got him!
Why not, Larry? We could get a positive confirmation that way.
Got a pen on you?
I'm going to hire Quint to kill the fish. I want to see that shark dead.
There's a fantail launch out there that won't make it beyond the breakwater.
Officer, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Chief Brody?
Dynamite!  How was your day...?
What? What?!
Where'd you get all this?
You're at the Institute full time? Or do you have a job?
What happened?
There is a kind of shark called a Great White Shark that every expert in the world agrees is a maneater.
I hope we get some more help.
This has got to be one big violation...
Think the tide's with us?
And nobody else saw her in the water?
Where'd you hide the 'Beach Closed' signs?
My husband tells me you're in sharks.
Is it! The best-funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.
Well... is everything all right?
I don't need to pass basic seamanship.
Hey, Squirt! You want to stow this gear or you want me to use it for ballast? It ain't good for much but bait.
What's that supposed to prove?
I'll drink to your leg.
...Mako. Fell out of the tail rope and onto the deck. You don't get bitten by one of those bastards but twice -- your first and your last.
Follow him!
That's disgusting! This is the largest, meanest, most vicious shark ever landed off Amity Island, and a known maneater!
Yeah, typically. That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.
Yeah, wizard, I guess. I mean do what you think is right.
Is that normal?
Well, we were once. You know, that time.
Well... thanks. I think I'm pretty much set until college on the Tic Tac front.
I try really hard, actually...
We both have shiny happy fits of rage. You want more fans, I want more stage. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Hey man.
Did you hear it's yours?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
No.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
Good. Call me when you're OFF the rag.
This is our attorney, Gerta Rauss.
So, let's discuss how we're gonna do this... thing.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.
Like what?
Oh.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby...
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
Juno was nice enough to bring this by for us.
Cold feet.
Cool.
I... How do you think of me, Juno? Why are you here?
That's not the point. We're just not in love anymore.
You should try Adderall.
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Juno? What's going on?
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
My partner uses these every time we have intercourse. They make his balls smell like pie.
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
What?
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
I sort of already have.
Well, well. If it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog! Back for another test?
Well, you know where the lavatory is.  You pay for that pee stick when you're done! Don't think it's yours just because you've marked it with your urine!
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
You're not listening to me.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Juno, what's the matter?
What would be a good time for you?
I called Gerta Rauss. She says she can represent both of us. They call it "collaborative divorce." It's apparently all the rage right now. And it's easy because we don't have children.
Are you takin' the pictures?
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
You took this picture?
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
...I don't know.
Nobody wants to hurt you Peaches!
Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that?
Brian.
Henry Lucas.
...and?
Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
So how's it going?
We could have been in and out of there in less than ten minutes...
Carrie.
What's that?
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
Brian I want him out of our car!
I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND.
Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight?
...never?
You're supposed to call me when you lose your job Early. I stopped by the mirror factory today, you left quite a mess behind there.
You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp.
What happened?
Looks like somebody cut off his ring finger.
How many times have you gone unprotected?
What do you think?
I knew you fucked it! I sat out here for like two hours! That girl was like twelve, and you hit it up!
Well, how was it?
She can fuck?
Oh shit. How long did it take?
But then when she got into it. She really got into it. It was good.
Oh man, it smells like butterscotch.
And I looked at her, and thought to myself Oh my god, this girl is a baby.
Shit.
You wanna go to Paul's house?
78th.
You got any money?
Well, those guys share everything, right?
That girl you boned last year. Remember?
Man, this guy is really good.
Yeah. I like her. I've wanted to get with her for a while now.
I watched her eat the watermelon. And all this juice started running down her chin and onto her shirt.
I don't care motha fucka. I'll bet you money she fucks me.
You wanna run by the park and see what everybody's doing? Get zooted?
Whenever you see someone who's really messed up, especially amputees and retards. You give them money. But if it's just a regular bum, you pass them by.
Nah.
Where you goin' tonight?
I'm goin'. You on the list?
Yo, you think we killed that guy?
You sure?
I don't know. I just never seen girls that did that shit before. But I think it looks nice.
I thought you had a girlfriend.
Yeah. His parents are away. It's gonna be a bug out.
Do you like kissing me?
I'm telling you. There's nothing in the world to worry about.
Nothing. I'm telling you I just want to make you happy. That's all. Just trust me.
I don't want you to hurt you. I'll be gentle.
What is it?
This makes Special K look weak. It's a euphoric blockbuster.
Come on Jennie. You look sad. Just take it.
What do I want to do?
I don't know. I just think that you would love it.
You know it won't hurt. I'll be gentle. I promise.
Have you ever had anal intercourse?
Can I ask you a question? I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
Yeah. I'm not saying you should get a tattoo. But you should make yourself happy.
Your a real philosopher.
The pain. The fucking pain!
You are being ripped open.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
Wish me luck.
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
I'm coming.
Yeah. Mine are my toes. Oh my God if someone sucks my toes I'll come in like ten seconds!
Oh shit.
Me. I can only take it up to fifteen minutes. Cause I get bored.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
I hate 'em.
Yeah?
So that's why Casper is how he is.
Not too late.
Hey Mom. Are you sure I can't get any money? Just a few bucks.
Hello?
Hello?
What are you guys doing?
First times are always wacked. Just be glad you didn't lose your virginity in the backseat of a rental car.
Slow.
Right.
Yeah. And it takes them either too long or too short to come. Have you ever had someone that took forever
By yourself?
We seem to have a little problem here?
It wasn't serious.  What's your problem?
What's that supposed to mean?
Morpheus.
Are you crazy?
What in the hell do you think you're doing?  Slamming down the phone in the middle of the trace.
You don't tell us how to run our investigation.  You got that?
You got it on the board.
We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
Sorry to ruin your trip to the city, but we got a real nut on our hands, Frank.
Take it easy.  Both of you.
No shit!
Ready for round two?
Sending yourself anonymous notes in the mail is one thing -- but who called him today?
Hello, Peter.
Someone who's going to become an important part of your life.  I want to play a game with you.
And -- what path is that?
Hello?
But you said you didn't know her.
And you want these girls to feel your pain?
Have you any idea what the message is?
You're playing the Tarakoss opening.
That wouldn't be very sporting. Remember Huxley?  "His play is always fair and just."
I'll give you anything you want. Anything!  Please!
I was thinking about leaving the phone line open so you could hear her die -- but I've decided it's better if you don't know exactly when I kill her. Good-bye Peter.
Sure.  We've got a modem line hooked up with the data base in New York.
Now what?
What is it?
The police came to me for help.  What could I do?
It worked out alright, didn't it?
You don't want to believe it.  It's a normal reaction.
Yeah -- that's what we've always thought -- but what if he wasn't?  What if I had nothing to do with the reason he came here?
You must be Erica.
Do you like my dad?
You ready?
How long has she been dead?
Any sign of rape?
Anything?
What about prints?
You mean, no prints but hers?
Same as the others?
What time did he get there?
And what if he's wrong.  If you were one hundred percent sure it was Peter you would've arrested him.  If it is someone else then he's going to kill again tonight and you're sitting here ignoring the message.
Could you tell me where you were last night?
I know.  You won two games against him and left the auditorium at eight forty five.  Where did you go after that?
You want me to go with you?  Maybe I can help.
He's using the map as a chessboard! The sonofabitch is playing chess with me!!
A shadow.  What's as big a castle?  As light as air , but one hundred men can't move it?  The shadow of the castle.  Are there any buildings that have the name Castle in it that cast a shadow long enough to fall across another building?
Where were you last night?
Then I'll transpose.
We got a problem?
Bainbridge Books.
Of course.  Yes, here it is.  Why, they're all the same?
Is this your first time here?
I love this hotel.  I stay here every time I visit my parents.
It seems like such a complicated game.
Sounds very violent.
--but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
That's a very personal question.
You.
Well, I think I've had enough.
They couldn't break the riddle.
You sure you don't want to eat something?
I think it's interesting.
I'm just curious.
Of course.
Alright.  What about me?
It was.
What is this?
Nobody could attack you.  You set your life up like one of your chessboards. You're impregnable -- but at the same time you've become trapped behind your own defenses.  You're cut off from everyone around you.
I just don't want to fight with you.
That's still no excuse.  You treat everything like a game.
You're wife died.  You can't feel responsible for that.
This letter.  I've never opened it.
I'm not nervous.
There. Now you look like someone I might want to marry.
Lyssa. Where are they keeping you?
Colwyn ...
You'll both wait. At least for five hours. The wedding is at three.
They have Lyssa!
The White Castle has fallen.
The new Queen lives.
This is not the first time the Dark Ones have attacked our world. They came once before, a thousand years ago. A young king and queen, with extraordinary powers, were given to us then, to lead the struggle. My fore-father was their Councilor, as I will be yours.
With two or three days' practice, you'll be able to use it as well as I can. Then we'll have a chance of fighting our way out of here.
There is no other way.
Yes. Each dawn it rises in a different land: sometimes in the mountains, sometimes in the jungle, sometimes the desert, sometimes the sea. Never in the same place twice.
You choose these?
She can't see out. She can't tell us where the Fortress is.
She was very faint. I was barely able to reach her.
I will melt that gold and pour it down your throat, old man!
She's on the other side of this wall. I can feel it!
She can see the Beast!
What use is my sword? I can't reach her!
I can. Because I choose it.
How did you know?
It is today?
Each to his fate.
I know the cruelty of such a fate.
Am I not beautiful enough to be loved?
I feel your pain, but I cannot betray her.
Help! Help! I'm drowning!
It could have been quicksand! I might have been sucked to my death.  Where is this place?
I just remembered I have urgent business in this direction.
Because you would not rob if you had no children to provide for.
They burn many villages. Even walled cities fall to them.
Yes. It will double our range.  I know at least a dozen ways to get horses. All cheap.
We could reach it on fire-mares.
What is that awful looking place?
Sir Ergo? ... My honorable Lord Ergo? ...
Oh, she was so beautiful - and I was so <u>ugly</u>.
Put me down, you lout!
Passable, pimple, very passable.
I do not want your power. It is hideous.
Freylag's stronghold?
Lord Rowan is one of Lyssa's godfathers. He will defend her in the ceremony. I wish that Lord Modred were here. He is a godfather of her own blood.
For some, the lure of power is stronger than the ties of blood. No matter. I had hoped to have the wedding next spring, Lord Turold, with all the nobles of the kingdom in attendance. But Fate and this war have ordained otherwise.
A fine match.
I tried to reach Ynyr, the old one. I led a hundred men to his place in Granite Needle, but it was surrounded. The Dark Ones guard it by night and by day they call out the Slayers. Ynyr cannot get out and no one can get in.
She has the power of vision.
We must reach the Valley of Reeds before the next dawn.
Go now.  Quell was wise. He knew that a man cannot ask more of his death than it help his friends.
She was not as beautiful.
She bore you many children?
You see?
Memory is no trick, it is a power. The power to see.
Knowledge.
The Fortress of Krull. When will it come near here?
A young man seeks her. A young man about the age I was when I met you.
I cannot stop the sand.
What's that man's name?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
...Office 2702.
Yeah, pal! And I didn't say anything, I said I don't know you.  But do you know what did she say, that stupid Raphaella?
Well... Did you sleep with him or not?
Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
OK, I'm fine.
Wow! It's brilliant!
The yellow and pink.
Mathilda? May I come in?
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now.  You said I learn very quickly.
May I go to the cinema?
For musicals?  That's part of the job!
If you knew, Leon...!  I killed one thousand in my head...  And this never disturbed my sleep.
It's true... But a first contract, it's an exception.
When I say I love you.
...Shit!!  We'd found him. We waited for him to get upstairs and he got out of the window.
...I prefer apartments...  Furthermore, there are always kids in a building. What about getting some friends?
Risky business, isn't it?
Mathilda... There's equally a lot of other things!
Poor darling, and then?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me?  I won't get shocked. I'm used to this!  My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it!  And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
...That's awful.  I hope you killed, that asshole?
May I ask you a personal question?
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
I don't know... Five minutes.
Huh? Move back, baby, I can't see anything.
Don't fear.
You can't sit here like that.
Rinaldi... Rinaldi...  What region do you come from?
...Who sent you?
Did you fish in Messina? The "pesce spada"?
I think I will get back in Messina this summer... It's too long I haven't been there.
Salute.
You'd better talk good, son, because, for the moment, I've got a quite bad opinion about you.  Norman smiles.
Do you recognize him?
Listen, son, you know as well as me this kind of hitmen: they come from nowhere, get the contract and disappear. They're lonely, worse than wolves.
He probably just went somewhere.
This smells good.
If you really want to do this... plan it out.  Rest up.  Train for it.  Build up your body.  Plan every stop along the way.  How much money?  Time?  Really do it properly.  This is all so -- by the seat of your pants.
I don't think you realize how serious this is Uncle.
I have to finish first.
A wife?... Did someone piss drunk run into your wife?  Crushed her like a bug.  Snapped her bones?
You're feeling old and you want to start exercising.  A lot of men your age feel the need to recapture their youth.  Don't feel embarrassed about it.
Have I forgotten something?  Is this a special day?
It's a tremendous amount of work -- moving.
Is this going to be similar to the flower incident?
I do love you... very, very much.
Walk with me?
It must've hit the window... I think its neck is broken.
I know where my heaven is.
You don't have to prove anything to her.
What's his story?
Red flag, man.
It's going to look beautiful when he turns out to be that animal who paid a visit to the Steadman's house.
Shit!  He jumped!
Don't worry baby, it shouldn't take you more than five days if you just stop to sleep and eat.
What happened?
You're amazing... What are you doing Mr. Parker?
Pacifica, California... that's a long ways away.
There are a lot of people worried about you.
In a hospital.
They told me, you might try to talk me into something... You need to rest Mr. Parker... It's for your own good.  I've been following your story for a long while.  It's a beautiful thing you did.
You're going to have a lot of work to do when I get back.
You look so happy -- how long have you been married?
He wants to reward you... That's why I'm here.
I really want that watch.
Everything's ten dollars, and there's no alcohol.
Orange soda?
Sparkling apple cider?
Mind if I use the bathroom?
Want a drink? I'm having one.
If I was I'm sorry.
What's up?
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
How long have I been here?
What do you mean?
Sera...
Don't you like me, Ben?
Sera... what you don't understand is...
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
Why?
I'm going to fill it right now.
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new  one.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
You have been lonely?
Well, then. You'll need excellent recommendations from your professors, a heck of an admissions essay and at least a one-seventy-five on your LSATs.
Brooke, I believe you. But a jury is gonna want an alibi.
He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
It's so shameful...
I have made my fortune on my ability to teach women how to perfect their bodies with the Brooke's Butt Buster workout.
So at some point in the -- twenty minutes you were in the shower, your father was shot?
Chutney, why is it that Tracy Marcinko's curls were ruined when she got hosed down?
Dewey Newcomb?
Come again?
Was she carrying a weapon?
So she was distraught that her husband was dead?
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof that you and Mrs. Windham were having an affair?
Yes?
Could I be anymore goddamn spastic?  So you're sure, this Warner guy is "the one"?
And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
Hi. Sarah Knottingham.
The idiot speaks.
Warner can't even do his own laundry.
Why else would she have flown in from Newport? It's not like she'd Fed Ex a six carat diamond.
What if -- you know -- it's not the night?
I don't know! Everything was normal at first and then he said he needed someone more --  Serious!
We still love you. Sisters forever!
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time?
Good luck.
Aside from that.
Why?
How can you still believe she's innocent?
Whoa -- Why?
So now you're -- ?
Oh, my God!
Up for a celebration dinner?
Someone missed you.
Thank you, Serena, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Yes? Ms. Woods?
Maiden name -- Daniels.  You know her?
Class schedule, map, book list.
I'm fully amenable to that discussion.
Proposing?! Elle, If I'm going to be a politician, I need to marry a Jackie, not a -- Marilyn.
C'mon. Let me take you home.
You go where?
Now I am.
I didn't mean --
In court. On opposing sides.
But I guess it wasn't enough for Brooke.
We come watch... we come watch...
What?
We watch... good fun...
On the contrary!  The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting.  Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
Do you feed on mice and rats?
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
What?  Speakee loud!  No hear velly good.
No need lie, boy.  I no hurt you. Do I look like I wanna hurt you?
Flozen foleva not good.
An' how you do it?  How you rift cuss?
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Generally known!  What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Did you hear?  Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
Twill take more than heart.  Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
There's the spirit, lad.  If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
What is it?
Pregnant, is she?
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
My God!  Look!
Certainly understandable.
Archers!  Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Is she... dead?
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
Easily spoken...
That's it!  The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves?  Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
Aye.  Hurry now, Gump, the key!
I'm not afraid of the dark.
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
Keep me belly full, Jack.  Kill us another worm.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
Ogg lives there...!  And Thurgis!
Sweet slippers of Oisin!
Aye... my Lord...
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
A gentleman would offer water.
What shall we do?
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
No!  I won't let it happen...
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Biting you?
Step lively now!
What's this now?
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
I don't believe you.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
What's she doing?
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
Maybe there's a better idea... What about birds... get a lift from some friendly bird...
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Each fit for a hero... My uncle fashioned a hammer for Thor.  Twas he named it Mjolnir.  Grandfather forged Excalibur... You won't ever see finer craftsmanship.
No hurt Jimmy, sir... oh no, please, sir...
Can you show us the way?
It be the castle... we feel the castle... it be that close...
And video games after!
What's that for?
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Do you guys feel like painting?
I couldn't get it to go down.
Why?  What do you mean?
Are you his friend?
I had them in my pocket.
You're a good girl.
Where's your dad?
He's a freak.
I can't even take a shower here.
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
We're not gonna do anything.
Josh said...
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
This is such a street of whiners.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
Mr. Dokos says that your father missed his height envelope by six inches.
I have the permit.
I've been here twenty years.
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
Well, it's the least I can do.
Come over anytime you need to, Sam.
If she's not up, you can use my shower.
George, this is the third time.
Who are you, anyway?  I don't even know you.
I'm not going!
No one would blame me if I left!
I'm not doing it!
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid.  You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
I was holding for someone.  That wasn't even mine.
Do whatever you want with it.  I don't care.  All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
I know the feeling.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you.  So, I didn't.  He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
I loved him too much.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
I don't know what that means.  What kind of problem?
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
I'd eat a lot of red meat.
What would you do?
I'm sorry, I don't know what that was.
Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
I'm surprised he hasn't left.
It's okay.
When's school over?
Last time you were gone for a week!
I did say he could go.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
I'm married.
Peter left me yesterday.
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
Are you going to kiss me?
What's your deal with Alyssa?
He already knows everything about what he can't do.  You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
It's just a joke.  A stupid joke.
We've eaten.
The biggest waste of time since television.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
Despite you.
That's the problem.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
No.
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
Do you know anything about building a house?
You're sure about this?
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Adam, that's not true!
No, nigger.
Biscuit, when you're done with Jangle Leg, you think you could squeeze me in?
Yeah, but what about me and Ray? I didn't see our names on that pardon. You said you were gonna put in a good word for us.
Yeah...
She always said that if you were on the outside...
You been on the farm for quite a spell, haven't you?
You know I trust you, Claude.
I don't see no wedding ring, Banks. Conjugal visits are for married prisoners only.
For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes.
Engagement ring!
Did you go see my cousin Maynard like I asked you in my letter?
Yeah, that side of the family has all the looks and none of the brains. I hope he don't mess things up.
Listen, Claude, Maynard wanted to know if he should file the appeal on behalf of your friend, too.
Well, Mr. "C", how about buying a girl a drink?  Two bourbons.
Sure I do. What's your name again?
Claude Banks. How could I forget that? You've got to remember me. Ray Gibson. We went to high school together.
No, tell me what's so funny.
Ah, go chase yourself. I'll take my business elsewhere. And for future reference, you are no longer welcome at Ray's Boom-Boom Room.
When there is, you can forget about it. And I swear to God, you ever talk about my daddy again I'm gonna kick your bank-telling, loan-denying ass, you got me?
Well, not exactly. See, I met this girl. Real nice girl. God-fearing girl. Her name's Sylvia.
What can I say? When the spirit moves me.
You lost all our money in a card game?
Life?! How long is life? We were just walking back to the truck. We didn't do nothing! Fuck life!
Why do you think they call him Jangle Leg?
Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law.
Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him --
Does that mean I'm in?
Don't mention it.
Keep it together, Claude. You wake up the man, he'll shoot you for sure.
Allie Reynolds. He's my boy.
You get ketchup?
Can't be worse than any of these other fools.
I don't see you coming up with any plans.
Crop duster.
I hope you don't think I owe you anything. Because I don't owe you a damn thing.
I was sorry to hear about your mama passing.
What?!
You and Wilkins sure are getting chummy. You two planning on going steady, or something?
You can't fool me, Claude. I know you got something brewing.
Back to New York for starters.
This boat's gonna sail without you, too. I don't care if I last one day out here. At least it's one day of freedom. Now gimme those keys.
Claude, man, I'm serious. Give me those keys.
Don't shoot, sir. I can deal with this.  Ray, buddy, you don't want to shoot this white man. See, you do that, they'll kill you for sure. And it's not that I like you or anything, but I've kinda gotten used to having you around.
Don't tell me, I don't want to hear it. It's probably all fucked up, anyway.
Just put some mustard on it and eat it.
If you don't eat that ice cream right now, I'm gonna strangle you until you are completely dead.
How you doin'?
Alright, well, let's say you make it to Greenville. What's there, anyway?
Ray, my man, this steak is like butter!
Maybe I oughta eat your corn bread.
So Ray and Claude got their pardons, right?
What are you doing here, mama?
Stay calm, Ray. We'll find him. Claude! Has anyone seen Claude?
You can't go in there, Ray! You'll never make it!
Lemonade?
What's going on here?
Mr. Johnson is very well connected. If you were to let us go, I guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what I mean.
Hey, Ray, Goldmouth don't believe me. Ain't it so they got trains up in New York City that run under the streets?
Couple years back, Cookie made it clear to Greenville.
Hey, Ray, you ever been to the Cotton Club?
What's your name?
Last night? What are you talking about, Ray?
How you doing? We're looking for Slim.
Man, that music is hot. What goes on down there, Slim?
Blacks welcome there?
You don't have to drown that fella, Spanky. You already scared him half to death. He didn't know who he was fucking with.
Little Nicky.
Now will you get in the flask?
You work your ass off for ten thousand years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a decision like that.
You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan.
Keep it up and I just might make you my Queen for a night or two.
I remember that night, you had like four daiquiris.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
Where is he? He's late.
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
Okay, "bro," this jig is up...  Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Can I take him with me and have sex with his head?
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Knock, knock.
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
Check one-two. Check one-two.
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked like a giant parking lot. It wasn't even called Hell.
No wonder your uncle's so weird...
I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough. And she needed that.
Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time.
What's with that guy?
Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off.
That's a big pass, Elton John.
Schnapps...
Which way did he go?
What's Ozzy trying to say there?
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
The South.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
You have a dog? What kind?
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
Don't do it.
Do me.
Off limits.
I'm a Sandman!
Fourteen? Fifteen? Your days are running out. How long can you last? A year. Six months?  What happens when you're sixteen and you go green?
Never a pair. I have never had a pair.
There must be somebody else up here. I can't believe that he's --
What other food?
You are here. I couldn't believe it when they told me. What are you doing?
You need a lift. Let's go to Arcade and celebrate...  your alert successor... Logan-6.
You missed something special.
Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me -- and the machine blew up and I ran... I ran.
That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning!
Where do you live, Mary?
What's wrong, Available?
Well then...?
Yes... probably he was renewed?
You're beautiful. Let's have sex.
I couldn't get you out of my mind.
You can have any woman in the city. What do you really want?
I don't believe you. There has to be more.
Why show me?
About running, dying what?
I never heard of a Sandman running... ever...
Are you here to help me?
A Runner... Cathedral. A woman.
The Cubs. When they're flying on muscle there's no way to catch up. Without the dazzle, they'd just go past us --  -- too fast
I'm afraid.
I don't know what's going to happen to us Logan but --  Are you glad you didn't kill him?
Because you felt like a Runner, didn't you.
It's getting dark and cold. I'm tired.
It all seemed to make sense until Box.
You're right... it must be near now. We'll find it.
What does it mean?
They all have names and numbers on them. I wonder what they are?
We can't. We're going back.
"Beloved son"...  So people stayed together for that feeling of love... They would live and raise children together and be remembered.  I think I feel that way, Logan. Can we be that way?
And Sanctuary?
And... and how were you grown? Inside your mother?
Are you sure?
What kind of jewel is this?
What belongs to the people?
Of course... that's settled then. But just you remember your promise...
Come with us.
We're leaving.
Thousands and thousands... as many as my cats?
Well? How do you like it?
Cheeks? Cheeks? Right. Too much, you think?
No -- just there -- on the first level.  Don't look for us. We'll see you.
Sure, what's wrong with that?
Do you always sleep here?... In this room?... Both of you?
Very strange.
No.
We'll see that the patrol of the house is doubled.
How'd the camera get so high like that?
Has anyone made any threats to either of you recently?
We've got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
I don't know.
You like it?
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
You got him.
Wonderful!!... Wonderful to see you, Pete. How are you?
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you and Mrs. Trueworthy. Can you take care of Mr. Smith now?
Mr. Eddy's called every day... Can I call him to come in?
Okay. Thanks.
Hey.
The police called us.
They wanted to know if we'd had a chance to find out what happened to you the other night. They wanted to know if you remembered anything.
Please tell me.
A cell that was supposed to be occupied by an inmate named Fred Madison.
Then he's coming home with his mother and me.
We saw you that night, Pete.
How about Madison? Have we had even a hint of his whereabouts?
You just gonna let him go?
I wouldn't know how.
What is this, Rogoff?
I examined Madison last night, Marshall. He had a headache.
No.
That's it.
What's your axe?
The doctor said not to give you anything. You can see him in the morning.
What's that?
Does it say anything on the tape?
Good book, huh?
I called, you know.
I thought you were getting me a drink?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
The heart, I guess.
Because if anybody's givin' you trouble, Pete, I can take care of the problem... like that. 
I mean it, Pete... Like THAT!! 
Give that a try.
At sixty?
You like pornos?
Her name is Alice. You know I love that girl to death. If I ever found out somebody was makin' out with her, I'd take this...  ...and shove it so far up his ass it would come out his mouth... Then you know what?...
Last time I saw you.
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
No... I told you.
Why don't you like me?
Sheila...
Hey... Sheila.
All of it?
Conway's gone again! Run out! Listen to this! From Gainsford.
Where's the girl? Miss Stone.
Not even a radio?
A what?
Sorry.
Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
I say, good morning, Lovey.
I see.
Yes.
Uh-huh. All I know is - the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Uh-huh. You're a scream, Lovey.
Some layout they got here. Did you get a load of the rooms? You couldn't do better at the Ritz.
How about you Lovey? Come on. Let's you and I play a game of honeymoon bridge.
No kidding?
Yes.
I don't know why I associate with you, Mr. Barnard - or Mr. Chalmers Bryant - or Mr. Embezzler - or whatever your name may be.
Barney? Why should I? Never! We have nothing in common. Hmmpf, Barney! What effrontery!
And this trip to the valley. I can't imagine why I'd allow you to drag me down here. Why, we don't know anything about these people. We're not even armed!
Hey Lovey, come here! Lovey, I asked for a glass of wine and look what I got. Come on, sit down.
—then the bears came right into the bedroom and the little baby bear said, "Oh, somebody's been sleeping in my bed." And then the mama bear said, "Oh dear, somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" And then the big papa bear, he roared, "And somebody's been sleeping in my bed!" Well, you have to admit the poor little bears were in a quandary!
They were in a quandary, and—
Why? Why 'come on' all the time? What's the matter?  Are you going to be a fuss budget all your life? Here, drink it up! Aren't you having any fun? Where was I?
Oh my, isn't that pretty! What is it?
Hey, hurry up, you slow-pokes - I'm starved!
Chalmers Bryant!
Say, you're an American, aren't you?
Why, we have no crime here. What makes a criminal?  Lack, usually. Avariciousness, envy, the desire to possess something owned by another. There can be no crime where there is a sufficiency of everything.
Who?
One moment. You say the High Lama is the only one who can give us any information?
Oh, she'd quickly revert in her appearance to her actual age.
I'm sorry, but we have no doctors here.
Please let me help you.
What exactly do you mean by "almost any time now"?
Isn't it? Isn't it! You know I was a professor for twenty years? - and a very good one.
Oh, thank you. Thank you!
Oh, yes. There is a tribe of porters some five hundred miles from here. That is our only contact with the outside world. Every now and again, depending upon favorable weather of course, they make the journey.
A fine trick! Smart, aren't you? What a pack of lies you told us about those porters! Of course the minute they arrive, we can make arrangements to leave. If they take us. But you knew very well you'd tell them not to!
The High Lama? Who pays any attention to him? The porters laugh at the High Lama. All they want to know is how much gold he will give them. Well, I gave them more gold. I've been stealing it for a year. I'd do anything to get out of this place. To get away from that High Lama - the one who calls himself Father Perrault! Why, he's been insane for years!
I trust you have been comfortable at Shangri-La, since your arrival.
Sondra Bizet.
Yes, of course, your brother is a problem. It was to be expected.
You must not look to me for help. Your brother is no longer my problem. He is now your problem, Conway.
I have waited for you, my son, for a long time. I have sat in this room and seen the faces of newcomers. I have looked into their eyes and heard their voices - always in hope that I might find you . My friend, it is not an arduous task that I bequeath, for our order knows only silken bonds. To be gentle and patient, to care for the riches of the mind, to preside in wisdom, while the storm rages without.
All right, go ahead!  We go on to the next plane. Bring out any people that are left.
Bob, these are all that are left.
The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
Did you say we saved ninety white people?
Hello, George.  Cigarette?
Something happened to me, when we arrived here, George, that - well - did you ever go to a totally strange place, and feel certain that you've been there before?
Well - I heard that if you want a man's wife, she's yours, if he's got any manners.
Porters?
What about the porters?
For heaven's sake, Bob, what's the matter with you? You went out there for the purpose of—
I said we're getting out of here. Back to civilization. I made a deal with the porters. They brought in a load of books or something, and they're leaving tomorrow at dawn. They're waiting for us five miles outside the valley. Come on, get your things together. Where's your top coat?
Why not? What's going to stop me?
Well, I - I really don't know what to say. Except that you must be completely mad.
I'd go mad!
This would be funny - if it wasn't so pathetic. Why, she isn't a day over twenty!
So everyone is serenely happy in Shangri-La? Nobody would ever think of leaving?  It's all just so much rot! She's pleaded with me ever since I came here to take her away from this awful place. She's cried in my arms for hours, for fear I'd leave her behind. And what's more, she's made two trips to the plateau to bribe the porters - for me!
Bob, can't you get them to wait for us? They're leaving us farther behind every day.
Target practice again! One of these days they're going to hit us.
At the mercy of a mad pilot.
Was this your idea?
Yes.
Thank you.
I'm thirty.
Beautiful! I'm waiting for the bump.
You know, sometimes I think that it's the other that's the dream. The outside world. Have you never wanted to go there?
Would you like to wring my little neck?
Couldn't you arrange to make a little less noise?
What do you want him to do?
What is it?
Why, he's speaking English.
How about you? Do you want to go?
Home. Away from here. I've got porters to take us back.
EXCUSE ME–
You promised to come for tea yesterday. I waited for so long.
Thank you.
Sir, before you boot me, I just want to explain.  I mean, okay, you got a goat-guy with a hook for a head...
Yes.  That's true.  Actually, at this point, I just want A job.  Wait. What do you mean... yet?
Kids' game a couple galaxies over.
We have one motto: Peace on Earth.
It's easy.  You work your way up the secret service, one day stand with the President, meet the most important people on the planet, fulfill your dreams, live happily ever after.
What's so funny, cadet Cowan?
Which do you have your money on, Dee?
Dee.  God damn it.  I told you to go home.
Well, how about if I guess, then? Black: Vast space.  Deep. Spiritual. The essence of infinity.
I tell you, if we really wanted to bland in, that'd what we'd be wearing.  I think it'd be a good look for you, too.  I'll even help you choose a tattoo.
I know, that's usually the only time I actually have a shot.  And what if I wanted to see her again?  I'd have to completely re-introduce myself.
What'd you do before this, anyway? Wait-- let me guess. Ice sculpture? Rock?
Why?  Well, it wouldn't hurt you to have a little more fun.  I know I don't know you all that well, but--
Uh... you mean... a family of sixeyed, red-faced space creatures travelling to New Mexico to have dinner with their cousins, the invertebrates?  Seemed pretty god damned ordinary to me.
Well, Mr. Intuition... When the neighbors report screaming and we hear nothing but silence, what does that lead you to believe?
Now what?
He's a slimy little slithering scumwad is what he is.
Ernie Goose?  Cynthia?
Jesus...
I know what you're saying.  And I'm telling you I don't trust him--
Cause I've been doing this thirty years and if I don't know when something doesn't feel right by now--
I'm going to try and cut him off at the hotel.  You guys get to the Memorial.   Keep this stuff hidden.  The last thing we need is some over-zealous Secret Service twirp to...
Wow... this one's cool.  And it looks just like a shotgun.
Do IT!  SHOOT HIM!
After I got the shit beat out of me!
It's the most amazing insect nest I've ever seen.  And I'll tell you one thing, it sure as hell ain't the Andean Mollatoosa.
What the hell does that mean?
Is it my eyes... or is that thing a little...
Okay.  If you've got a bug problem-a big one.  And they're swarming and there's no way to shoot them all individually... how do you get rid of them?
Nowhere.
Try seven.  From unauthorized mobilization to appearing unconcealed before a resident.  You wanna tell me what's going on?  Huh?
Nothing at all?  Now?  Last month? Anything in the last few years?
Listen to me. You're holding something very very dangerous. You've just iced 350 of your pals--
They're not even gonna be your enemie-a if you don't give that to me really soon.
Found it.
This it?
Kay?  What's your 20?
I need you in Philadelphia.  I got a code 90, in a-high school.
They're gone.
Yeah?  What's up?
He's here.
Think, John.  Why would they set you up?
Anesthesia.  Try to relax, John.  I'm saying I'll have to remove your eyes.  Completely.
Why?
I put you away --
There's food in the refrigerator. Make sure you drink a lot of water.
It goes from the bathroom to the kitchen.
I don't ever see any of you precops down here, I'm not in trouble am I?
Victim's a white female.
That's an old one.  One of our first.
That's right.  It's a combined data stream based on all three previsions.
You the only sentry?
Why's he still a John Doe?  Why wasn't he ever ID's from an EYEscan?
Tell me not to worry, John.
And this is exactly the kind of behavior that will give them an excuse to do it.
I need you to do two things for me. One, watch Danny Witwer.
If he's looking for a flaw in the system --
Lara called me.
Just so you know, I've overridden the vehicle locator.  I just wanted to talk to you before Justice --
What he's doing now, we call "scrubbing the image", looking for clues as to where the murder's going to happen.
Go ahead.
Confirm with trig and image.
Uh, yeah, you mind getting me a piece of that cake they're eating down there?  I'm starving.
To them.
At least now you -- and I -- have the chance to make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone ever again.
You set me up...
I can't touch you!  And John, you can't be in here!  You'll confuse them!
She was looking right at me.
I'm impressed, Anderton.  You're on the lam, but you still got the time and energy to slice off a little jerky for yourself.
Stop --
I scored a goal!
Sean --
I forgive you.
I wanted to.
... and that I needed his help.  It wasn't so bad really.  I sang him a song, made him laugh, bought him a pretzel.  I took care of him.  I made him happy.
You're not gonna kill me?
Tell me, who was it, set this up?
You don't seem all that proud.
Jesus Christ -- why didn't I know about this?
Why?
Answer my question.  Did Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?
You want to bring it down.
Where?
That's all, huh?  Just walk right into Precrime, go into the Temple, somehow tap into the Precogs, and then download this Minority Report...
-- and then walk out.
I'll get EYEscanned a dozen times before I get within ten miles of Precrime.  They'll pick me up...
Which one is that?
I haven't worn this damn thing in years.  I just wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
He came to see you yesterday. Right before he got tagged.  What did you talk about?
Lamar, I found something.
It's the same prevision.
So there is a way to fool the system?
Of course, it would have to be someone with access to the Prevision in the first place, someone fairly high up --
So if you wanna kill someone, you take him to Miami.
Don't worry.  I'll bring him in unharmed.
It doesn't matter.  He wins.
There a maid in this hotel?
If you were a child killer, you took these pictures, would you leave them out on the bed for anyone to find?
People, if you don't let the spyder scan you, we'll have to come in and arrest you.
Raincheck?
This your work?
Cream and sugar.
I don't have any sugar either.
You said in your divorce papers that he tried to kill himself.
What was it then?
You know I need to use you.
They've never been separated before.
Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
Yeah.
What's the matter? You ain't got no snifters in this motherfucker?
...And here is the key to the mini- bar. Room and tax has been picked up by Cardiff Giant, as well as one fifty in incidentals.
Yes, sir.
Not on me, sir.
Thank you very much, sir.
Honestly, the suites are all about the same.
So, wait, you're from where?
Okay. We got a lot happening here. Here comes the good part... Okay...
Is he cute?
Should I fuck him?
I got news for you, Horrace got his ass out of there before you did.
I don't know.
Oh, please.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
No coke tonight.  Right?
Ho's a fucking pimp! He encourages Wendy to turn tricks. And she's his fucking wife!
I never promised you anything.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
Take her.
It's already been a hell of a night. Where you been?
What's your record at?
What's his name?
When's it going down?
Why isn't Ruiz coming?
How so?
A million. Easy.
Never won a race. But it got me in with the trainer. We'd have a thing, I don't remember, some fucking thing. The jockey would raise his whip, it meant the fix was in, we'd all go running. People get greedy. First they bet small, they keep their mouth shut. Within a month's time, everyone and their brother was in on it. The odds would drop, I mean you could watch the goddamn board. It looked like a fuckin stopwatch, the odds would drop so fast.
I like you, kid. Why do you gotta make it so hard for me to take care of you?
I got a way we make everybody happy.
We try something out. There's someone I'm in business with named Ruiz. I want you to accompany him on a drop.  Just as scenery. Ruiz has his boys. I just want a big guinea with a busted up face to give him a deep bench. As a deterrent.
That was before he lost my carpet cleaning van.
Yeah. Sure.
It's not that I don't appreciate the offer...
Yes.
I don't need a few days. I'm gonna settle down with Jess. She's through dancing. We're opening a restaurant.
Now listen. The gig couldn't be simpler. You carry the money to the Welshman, he checks it, hands you his marker, you're done. The washed money goes directly to Maxie. Long as you hand off the bag, you're tight.
I'm not sure. All I know is the account is Cardiff Giant.
Where is the Soho Grand?
I can wait around if you want.
Spa?
This Ruiz guy, what's his deal?
How am I being shitty?
I'll page you with the number. I'll see you later. What time you done?
I do. It's a fuckin Persian Palace.
I think we might.
I gotta pick up the baby.
How'd you unlock my phone?
Jesus Christ, fine. Alright?
See, man. Maxie fuckin takes care of you when you're in. Beats cleaning carpets.
I'll get the girl.
'Cardiff Giant.' That's us.
Jesus, man. Plus ten?
Don't worry about it. Just be smart.
Oh really. Why's that?
It's on West Broadway. We can walk.
You just don't fucking get it, do you?
You know this guy?
Yo, fuck him, man. Calling us guineas...
You happy?
You fucking nuts?
You gonna shank him in the shower?
Let's check out the penguins.
We need guns.
I'm pretty sure we do.
All the more reason.
Eighty five.
You coulda picked up a tab every once in a while.
I'm sorry...
We rep lines? You know? Fashion?
I don't wear a white wig, I don't carry a gavel.
Where's the surprise?
You want to come splash around.
Yeah, but, we're good. You know what I mean?
What's up, man.
Yes?
Yes.  Would you care for another one?
Where's Spa.
I'm not saying shit to neither of you.
Stop.
Ow, shit...
No shit?
Sure. Anyplace in particular?
Coke?
Sorry, mates. Now there isn't even enough to go around...
Here they are, then.
Come, now. You just got here.
I can't yet vouch for the amount, unless you want me to sit here and count.
Good morning.
Nigger, please. Don't even order that artichoke shit. West side guineas. Forget the drinks, Leo. We gotta roll. What do I owe you?
Yes. You're going to New York.
You want... Why are you picking on me?
No. I'll take a strega.
So, we're talking money laundering...
Scotland.
I'll get it.
What they call you?
Not this boy... I ain't fighting their war. I got my own. Right chere. Heard tell you're a good man to know.
You ain't bullshitting me, is you, boy?
Sometimes you got a big ugly mouth.
1, 2, 8; 2, 8, 1.  I git 'em all?
1, 2, 8 hit, didn't it?
You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.
If you ain't trying to punk me, what's your hype?
What did you give it to me for then?
You ain't lying.
Like what? Looking like me? Like a nigger?! Why don't you want to look like what you are? What makes you ashamed of being black?
I respect myself. A man cuss because he hasn't got the words to say what's on his mind.
Where am I gonna start?
Allah has sent us a prophet, a black man named Elijah Muhammad. For if God is black, Malcolm --
I knew you'd hear me. The white man is the devil. All white men are devils.
You are now Benjamin 2X.
Folks are sitting out there today, not next week, expecting to hear our program.
Make it plain.
Women talk too much. To tell a woman not to talk is like telling Jesse James not to carry a gun or a hen not to cackle. And Samson, the strongest man that ever lived, was destroyed by the woman who slept in his arms.
I see your point.
You're from Detroit, near where I come from. You majored in education at Tuskegee. You're studying nursing and having trouble with your family.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
There's always talk, always been talk, and always will be talk. Don't they say how I'm trying to take over the Nation, how I'm getting rich off the Nation?
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
I'm sorry. I haven't been the best husband or father.
Families shouldn't be separated. I'll never make another long trip without you and the kids. We'll all be together.
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Brother Earl.
Let's cancel.
Now just a moment, just a moment --
Mr. X is a demagogue. He has no place to go, so he exaggerates. He's a disservice to every good law-abiding Negro in the country. Can I ask you a question?
If you want to tell me.
Are you Elijah's pimp?
'Bout every other night, Red.
I mean it's late, baby.
Malcolm, you can be anything you want. You got class and you're smart.
I think sometimes, Mrs. Little, candor is the only kindness.
Did you hear me?!
Another one?
To wire your car so it would explode when you turned the ignition. The Ministers say you are spreading untruths about the Messenger. The Ministers say you are a great hypocrite, Judas, Benedict Arnold. The Ministers say your tongue should be cut out and delivered to the Messenger's doorstep.
You evil this morning.
Yeah, girl; that's your story. When you gonna holler "rape," sister?
You will, baby -- if the time come.
Baby, I was gonna give it to you.
You had the number.
Hey, man, gimme some skin.
I forgot to tell you I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.
Baby, I love you. Take it easy, greasy. How about a snort?
You is something, Homeboy. My trouble is -- I ain't had enough stuff yet, I ain't et all the ribs I want and I sure ain't had enough white tail yet.
I'm half wop, half nigger and ain't afraid of no one.
Then I put him to bed and pour talcum powder on him like a baby. He gets his jollies off.
Who the hell are they?
Brother Minister he often talked about you. He loves you, loves you like his own son. Says you are the best, his greatest Minister but that someday you would leave him and turn against him.
Yes, I am, Brother Minister. All I want is support for my children. He should provide for his children. That's all I want.
You have a rather checkered past. Mr. Creasy. Your Interpol file is six pages long.
The last few days may represent the best police work of my life.
You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be.  The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
[Where are you coming from?]
[Senor?]
I traced the PIN. I have an address for you. But I need to see you.
[Daniel.]
[No offense, but I'm sorry that your profession needs to exist.]
[Do you ever see the hand of God in what you do?]
[I don't know, I swear.]
[I'm professional. I just do my job.]
[I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.]
[The most important thing in life is family. And there you are. You have my family. What do you want?]
[This is not possible. But in that house I have money. If I tell you where --]
[What do you mean?]
[That he used policemen. That you killed them, it made it a police matter. The Ramos family couldn't refuse our involvement.]
[And I had my men ready.]
[Two and a half. That's how much there was.]
And what if amateurs try it?
When did Mexican Customs start getting smart?
What are you doing here?
Bullshit. I've known you fifteen years. You don't visit.
There's still ink on my fingers from last week.
Creasy?
Fuck. Look at you; you won't last a day the shape you're in. Unless you stop bleeding you should have your spleen removed.
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
We're taking a different way home.
Not at all?
You're fast.
Do you think he'll come back?
How's the ankle? Can you put your weight on it?
Why do you ask?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
Could I ask you a question?
You don't drink like you used to.
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
Creasy... Wait.
And Lisa will be able to save face. We won't be the only family without a bodyguard.
For an American she understands this country very well.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
Yes, mom?
[He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything.]
[I know this. Your point?]
[Then what do you have to lose?]
[Is it true? Creasy saved the little girl that was kidnapped yesterday.]
[And as long as we're talking information, there's something else as well.]
Tell me about your friend Creasy.
None of your business. Or mine for that matter. I got nothing more to say.
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend, than ten years of your courts and tribunals. So stay out of his way.
I told you she wasn't especially attractive, but that she had a good deal of charm, and she's really a real nice girl...
Millie's been after me to fix her up with a date, so I...
Hey, Herbie...
You wanna have a drink before we start dancing?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
I could see she likes you.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Who you gonna call?
Are you kidding?
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Who told you that?
I don't think I remember him.
Ufa!
Ah?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
This is the kitchen.
Marty...
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara...  Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
You say something?
What?
And that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?
What I like about Mickey Spillane is he knows how to handle women. In one book, he picks up a tomato who gets hit with a car, and she throws a pass at him. And then he meets two beautiful twins, and they throw passes at him. And then he meets some beautiful society leader, and she throws a pass at him, and...
Wadda you wanna buy a shop for, will you tell me? You gotta good job, you got no wife, you got no responsibilities. Boy, I wish I was you, boy. Waddaya wanna tie yourself down with a shop? What's he want? Five thousand down? You're gonna have to carry a mortgage sixty, seventy bucks a month. A mortgage anna note from the bank. For Pete's sake, you're a single man with no responsibilities. Stay that way, boy. Take my advice.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
So these two girls come over to the bar...
...and they sit down right next to me...
I look over at this one nexta me, not bad, about thirty-five -- Hiya, Marty...
When you gonna get married, Marty? You should be ashamed of yourself. All your brothers and sisters, they all younger than you, they married and they got children. I just saw your mother inna fruit shop, and she says to me, "Hey, you know a nice girl for my boy Marty?" Watsa matter with you? That's no way. Now you get married.
Sure.
Well, there's the Stardust Ballroom. That's a kind of a big dance hall. Every Saturday night, it's just loaded with girls. It's a nice place to go. You pay seventy-seven cents. It used to be seventy-seven cents. It must be about a buck and half now. And you go in and you ask some girl to dance. That's how I met Virginia. Nice, respectable place to meet girls. You tell Marty, Aunt Theresa, you tell him, "Go to the Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes."
Aunt Theresa, we figure the best way to ask her is you say that you're very lonely, see? And wouldn't she come and keep you company, because that way, you see...
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
Listen, let's go downa Kaplans' apartment. They told us to come down.
Marty, I don't know how to tell you how much I appreciate what you and your mother are doing, because the kinda thing was happening in our house was Virginia was in the kitchen making some milk for the baby. So my mother comes in...
Tommy!
I know what you're gonna say. A man's gotta stop being his mother's baby sooner or later. How many times you gonna say it? She's my mother, you know. I oughta have some feelings about her, don't you think?
Tommy...
What about the time she wanted to make an old-fashioned Italian dinner for my brother, but you wouldn't let her!?
Once a month you couldn't let her use the kitchen!
I don't think I can give absolution to a man who's about to commit suicide. It's a mortal sin.
Good. You've both been working close to the front.
I may need you to go to work practically immediately. But meanwhile perhaps you'd like to meet some of your fellow officers.
You boys'll have to go to work early.
What are you going to do with him?
Stop him! Stop that man!
Now I got you for a witness, I'm going to try again. So far all I dragged out of him is he's from Bahston and he's only been in the Army two months.  Where were you when they drafted you?
Don't you use olives?
How you, Walt? We was just fixing to have a nightcap.
Y'all mind the store.
Us. Lead us not into...
You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
My name's Hawkeye Pierce.
Make it yourself, or is it real?
Colonel Blake, have no fear. Hawkeye and Duke are here.
No, Hawkeye just said it all.
Yeah, that's right.  You better get us a chest-cutter before there's trouble.
Must be Painlees Pole Day in the Shower Tent.
When will he be able to write?
I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
Where the hell we going to get us a football team?
Look at the size of those two beasts.
Oh, I'm used to it. What makes me sore is how they behave towards you.  They ought to be grateful to have you.  I certainly am.
I was just asking...
If we had closer relations, there wouldn't be any misunderstandings. That's where a football game would help. Between your outfit and mine.
Gimme three.
I'm going to play poker until three a.m. or until the patient is ready for surgery. However, if you'd like to operate on him yourself right now, be my guest. I get the same dough whether I work or not.
Radar!
What for?
B-E-R-T, right. See you tomorrow.
I think I've seen this nut somewhere.  Haven't I?
I came within about ten yards of you. You know something, Trapper, the way we been going, if we ever got to see a real golf course again, I bet we could burn it up.
But besides the operation, we've got to get in at least eighteen holes of golf.
Best thing you could do for all of us is grab some sack time.
We'll have to close this hole and make one on the other side.
It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
But he's got five times the man-power to draw on.
But we'd have to break his leg or something to keep him out of the game for good.
Captain Pierce, would I be imposing...?
The bastards outconned us.
If you start the game instead of waiting, you mean?
You're getting a workout, you and Captain Forrest, your first night.
I don't make the distinction. But the sex urge is a powerful force. In women just as much as men.
In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
You're asking for somebody else?
It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
Be the longest short-arm inspection you ever held!
What's the story?
What's wrong with him?
Or in dreams either. I repressed it completely. Classic pattern of inhibition.
I have not understood what you means.
Officer all sleep now, yes? And I go wash clothes.
Hi, Ho-Jon. How they goin'?
The blonde dish.
We'll find out what they are when you throw us out.
Stop acting like a colonel, Henry. You know Trapper wouldn't sock him without a good reason.
Fifteenth straight day there've been six o'clock choppers. How long can a battle go on?
What's going on? Who started this?
We got it, men... Ho-Jon's keep as Androscoggin... if there is such a place. And the big news is, the General wants a rematch.
O'Reilly!
Sir?
To Major Burns' tent. Yes, sir.
Sir?
Splendid, sir. No problems.
If I can make a suggestion, Coach.
Yeah?
Soup? Rice? What are we doing, beginning all over again?
We don't have to see him. Call that halfassed Army hospital and tell them to be ready to put some lipiodol in this kid's esophagus and take X- rays.
Did you get it, too?
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Yes!
Who?
Oh. Yeah.
Hello, John.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Can I help you pack?
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see?  But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
Did you write this?
How much money do you get?
Thank you very much for everything.
Oh!
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
John Doe.
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Looks all right—
That's our man. He's made to order.
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night!  No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday—here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
What's the idea?
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Had any schooling?
Baseball?
Who's got him?
Well, anyway, I—I guess nearly everybody in the neighborhood came, except the DeLaneys. The Delaneys live in a big house with an iron fence around it and they always keep their blinds drawn, and we always figured that he was just an old miser that sat back counting his money, so why bother about inviting him? Until Grimes, the milkman spoke up and he said, "Say, you've got the Delaneys all wrong." And then he tells us about how they cancelled their milk last week, and how, when he found a note in the bottle he got kinda curious like and he sorta peeked in under the blinds and found the house empty. "If you ask me," he says, "they're starving."
Well, sir, about a dozen families got together and gave Grubbel a job watering their lawns. Isn't that wonderful? And then we found jobs for six other people and they've all gone off relief!
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her.
Join the John Doe Club.
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself—I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson—and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
Only one thing to do, Hank. Drop the whole business quickly.
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies—but stay out o' newspaper business!
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
How about family? Got any family?
That's a lie!
That's got nothing to do with it!
Oh!
What do you mean, too bad?
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
Yes, Spencer. Who? The Governor? Well, what about me? it's my building he's jumping off of! And I'm up for re-election, too!
No -- you can't do that.
Mind if we make a stop on the way? We busted Frank Antonucci on possession. He gave us a lead on that Polk Street jewelry heist.
Where's the stereo?
What's the line?
God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
You gotta do this for me. I'm in here because of you.
Who's controlling your mind?
This has nothing to do with Walter.
Where's the car?
Who are you again?
That's right, and a plane waiting at the airport. If he doesn't...
For now that's all.
Open your shirt.
You ever been in a hostage situation?
What's the point of this?
You'd never been out of New York?
You wouldn't want to put a small wager on this, would you?
She's back in Jersey... going to graduate school.
Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
My name's McCall. I'm unarmed.
The 6 horse is last.
To run last?
And what about the ones you don't save?
And what if you can't live with it?
I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
I worship you.
That a new picture?
Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
It's already started.
What are you talking about? This is it. This is the stuff right here.  Well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Yeah?
Hmm?
I was just thinking...  There's something special I want to talk to you about.  I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship.  A deeper level.
Stay up there, Girl...
There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.
It's been decided that you take on another partner and train him to be able to take over for you.
You know you've got nothing but cars down there in impound.
The car is part of the deal.
Roper...
What do you need?
It's okay.
Why?
What's happening?
But what would happen to me?  I have no body to return to.
Divinity?
The new world.
How long 'till we can eject?
We can be there in fifteen minutes and rip him off the system.
Try harder.
A hotel?
Then what's with all the staffing programs in his account?
We drugged her.  So she wouldn't remember.
Someone you have to get back to?
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
Most nights you wake up crying. Never knowing why.
That's why they told you you can't go inside.  They can't have you running into her.
But I don't know anything about programming.
And it meant something.
I'm sorry.
It was just there.
Tanner-eighteen-six-two-nine.
Waiter, busboy, Maitre-De --
Connect to public access.
It's far too dangerous.  Zordon would never allow it.
I can hardly walk...
Release the power WITH the power.
I am the wolf, cunning and swift!
That's the only way to the Monolith...
Here you go!  No pushing!
Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer.
But boss, what about their parents?
Anybody see them?
How the heck?!...
I'm sorry, sir. Our clientele is restricted to White Anglo-Saxons.
You own a hotel, sir?
The goddamned bastards.
I remember reading a poem in college. "Sicily. Poor, noble isle...".
We have a commission. If there's a dispute over territory, the commission decides.
Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
Four-twenty-eight.
They told me you wanted to talk about this Shane business.
Shane was a friend of yours?
Does Maranzano have to kiss you on the lips before you'll take his goddamn money?
The deal's too good, Frankie
Something came up.
Why do you bother with perfume when you smell like this?
Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
Julius Caesar never took no vote.
We'll figure out something.
Like Don Maranzano.
It's just that Maranzano's the only bastard I ever heard brag about gettin' audited by the IRS. He came out clean, so he thinks his shit don't stink.
We got exactly two choices, Maranzano or Masseria.
What you mean? Tommy ain't done nothin'.
Why's it gotta be Tommy!
We're gonna change it, Bugs. Once we get rid of the Dons, the Commission's gonna rule. No more wars. No more vendettas. No more Boss of All the Bosses.
If ever I need a Boss, Joe.
I'm glad ya come.
He'll think something's wrong I ain't there.
What the fuck does that mean?
Where we headed?
And what went on your little party in Atlantic City. I got ears.
So tell me when I ain't done it.
Take one of 'em out, and they'll all line up against us.
We gotta talk in private. I got a friend in Coney Island who's gonna open his restaurant just for us.
Sure. But ya got a deck a cards? I wanna play some Klob.
Good liquor draws a good crowd.
Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
The Internal Revenue came to my offices. I turned over all my ledgers. They found nothing. Charlie, I am a businessman.
We combine everything. You are my second in command.
The terms will be mine.
I will be the Boss of All Bosses.
You think this is a coincidence? Next week half your customers will be buying their Scotch, our Scotch, from Maranzano. In a month, he'll be in Scotland talking to my distillers, because you can't move product. I'll be out of business, and you'll be working for Maranzano.
Strategy.
Know somethin'? This stuff's just kick-the-can on ponies.
Johnson's still on board. Even Maranzano won't screw with Nucky in Atlantic City. But everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.
Everybody's talkin' about ya, Charlie. First time anybody ever got took for a ride and lived.
Yes?
Know something Tommy? You're a mensch.
Best we got.
When he first came in to the sleep lab?
How do you get from <u>here</u> - to <u>there</u>?
What's the maximum safe dose?
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare <u>you</u> right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
<i>De nada</i>. Now, come here...bend over...before I change my mind.
DEATH!!
Death! Thank you!
At the moment, yes.
Comas are unpredictable. He could wake up today, tomorrow, a month from now...
Go? There's a potload of money here, pal. You got three major toy companies...you got the guys from Burger God over here...
Oh my God...you're proposing?
Holy shit.
You know, Julie, even if this works - which it probably won't - that stuff is tricky. You don't know what it'll do to his brain.
Uh huh. And?
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a <u>nightmare maker</u>! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Meaning me, of course. I'm referring to myself. You have to assume Monkeybone would be a pretty lucrative franchise...
Bitchin' good cake.
We'll hop a plane tonight. An island ceremony. An Abba Dabba honeymoon!
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
Stu?
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
Go. Just <u>go</u>.
<u>You</u> have humiliated me in public for the <u>last</u> <u>time</u>.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come <u>he</u> goes back and <u>I</u> stay here?
<u>He</u> got an E-ticket. Where's mine? <u>When do I get</u> <u>to wake up</u>??
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resumé. ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Stu...LOOK!
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
Excuse me, sir.  I just wanted to thank you for helping me get into my building yesterday.
You don't have to worry.  She's going to be fine.  We're law-abiding citizens just like you.
I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...?
You know ...  ... whoops!
Don, this is my mother.  Mom, this is my boss, Don Palmer.
No, I had a dream about daddy.  Do you think I'll ever meet anyone like him?
He's an organic farmer.
Where to?
I'm from South Dakota.  Where are you from?
Ohhh.  Do you know the East Village?
The Majority Leader? Right over there. And that's [           ] the Minority Leader. They're both pretty good in the clinches.
Look out for those fellows--they tell the truth about you--sometimes. That corner over there is reserved for guides and sightseers who come in for five minutes to rest their feet. That section over there is reserved for Senator's friends. The front row--the empty one--is for the President and White House guests-- see that old couple over there-- they've attended every session for the last twenty years. Over the clock back here is the Diplomatic section. They and the page boys are the only real class we have in this place. The rest are mostly people who come here like they go to the zoo--
All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can get ten-to-one around here if you think you can remember their names. The Vice-President presides over the Senate--you know that. It's how he earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator-- on the east side of the Chair we still have the old snuff boxes with real snuff in them if you like snuff.
--what possible explanation can you offer for this charge being--as you say--"trumped up" against you!
And you say you never signed this contract with Mr. Allen?
You've never *seen* this contract.
But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about that and--?
But it *isn't*?
Yes, sir--big as life. Been there some time now.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But *no*--I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
You play--left field.
Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've told you--the dopes are gonna inherit the earth anyway--
Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, let's go down and do it over a hunk of steak.  Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore-- that rarest of companions--is here at your side.  To genteel crime, kid.
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* anyway?
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!)
You know, we're getting married.
Taylor, my dear.
I do *not* want a Senator. And I do *not* want any more of this nonsense! Emma!
Fine. The first thing to do is-- present Mr. Smith to the press--in the *right* way. Hurry him along, Bill.
I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into that room and tell Jim Taylor and Joe Paine that I give them *one more minute*--
Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll perform like a trained seal.
What!
But you went ahead and made this appointment without asking me--
Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? His head--Ma'll take the tail.
What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.
What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting you down?
He's the greatest *American* we got, too, Dad. Can tell what George Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in it.
A pet shop?
All right, Senator--let's get these bags and the livestock together--
You should hear our Ranger Band rattle that off--if you want to *hear* something! Good evening, Miss Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.
Will the Senator yield?
Has the gentleman the effrontery-- standing there convicted and in disgrace--to try to force the postponement of that bill--?
Will the Senator yield for a question?
Yeah, Dad always used to say the only causes worth fighting for were lost causes.
I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a fellow bucks up against a big organization like that, one man by himself can't get very far, can he?
Senator Paine, if I could do just that one thing while I'm here, I-- I'd feel that I--
Thank you, sir. Thank you for your time.
Gosh!  Well--looks good as new. If there *is* any damage, I'll--
Mr. President--
Will the Senator--
Yes, Ma?
But you have some objections here and there. And maybe right, for all I know. But the point is--there's no sense stopping the whole works now-- specially after some men have worked hard for a long time to put this through--
What's your name?
Whose statue is that?
The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!
Convene--that's it--yes. I got to pick up some of those parliamentary words. I imagine a fellow can get pretty lost in the Senate without 'em--
We're going right ahead with--*what*?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we now?
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and *waits its turn on the calendar again*. The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like *those* changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down.  Are you catching on, Senator?
It hasn't been easy, has it?
I never met anyone more--more intelligent--or capable. I--I don't know where I'd be on this bill of mine without your help--
No! Gosh! I better get moving here, Miss Saunders--  Everybody else calls you just plain "Saunders." Why can't I?
Abigail.
Gee--I hope so. What's all this?
Do you mean all--look--look we'd better open them up--see what they say here--look at the money--what does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I would like to come to your boy's camp and I shine shoes at the station and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't that wonderful. Look and he signs it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." Isn't that marvelous?  Say--have I got some paper here?
The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma all about you. If I tell it right-- the first thing you know you're going to get the best jar of preserves you ever tasted.
Yes--right here. Just a second--  Miss Paine.
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
No. That night--I--well, *you* know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
I *don't* think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is--*fight*! 
Ah! That's more like it! What?
*Gentlemen*! Gentlemen are supposed to believe in something decent. Instead of twisting facts and making a joke of everything--why don't you tell the people the *truth* for a change?
How--how do you do, Miss Paine?  I--I apologize for looking like this-- I--I have to be going now--
Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--  I--I just can't seem to talk in this suit.  I'll tell you a secret. It's brand new.
Order, gentlemen!
Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone though--wearing an apron for the ceremony that was embroidered by Madame Lafayette--
Ax?
H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!
I know that.
Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
--I've used every argument in the world to try to turn him off. He just keeps coming back to the dam-- and what he knows--
Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, Happy! He's done for!
Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this guy--! I smelled it!
That's right.
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
What do you want, Senator?
Oh, it's all right--it's all right. It seems a shame, though, to part company like this after all these years, especially now with a national convention coming up. Joe, I've put everything I have behind you. And so did all of our friends, but I guess we'll survive. We'll just have to find somebody else that's got a little more sense, that's all. In the meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith about Willet Dam. It's your bill-- it's your reputation, and if he can't find enough facts to break you with, you just send him to me and I'll give him a couple of good ones. I'm taking the next plane home.
Jim!
It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye on him. If he gets to his feet and says anything--
His first 'whiff'!
Father--oh.
Well, at the expense of some of the furniture, Susan--you've made another conquest.
Will the Senator yield?
I accuse this man--by his tone--by his careful denials--he is deliberately trying to plant damaging impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* tell you why we were in tht room. Because Mr. Taylor, a respected citizen of our State, had brought with him the evidence against this man, later presented from this floor, and *we were urging him to resign*-- !
Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
Is there objection?  You may proceed, Senator.
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us.
Good morning.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself.
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming.
Are you married?
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Oh, thank you!
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Feel better now?
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Hello, Mary?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
The guy's balmy.
You're a fool, Babe.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
That's the rub.
Ow! My foot's asleep!
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
don't want to be critical, John, but here it is—
Yes, but you said—
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
I wish you luck, sir.
Thank heaven.
Nuisance value?
Must we have the echo?
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
I can understand that.  We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock.  Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later.  Goodbye and thank you.
Look!
Okay, then. Go to it.  And, Charlie—
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."[2]
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf.  Beautiful.
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Sometimes it's the only solution.
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to—
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
Now, where were we?
—my wife wanted me to tell you she—  —she prays for you every night.
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
Yes, sir.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
No - I don't want it, thank you.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Proceed.
Mr. Deeds, do you recall forcibly ejecting people from your home?
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon.
Anything else, Mr. Deeds?
Proceed.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
Who are they?
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters.  What can I do for you gentlemen?
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Tails tonight, sir?
What do you think you're doing?
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Oh. Oh!  Has Miss Dawson called yet?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
Hey, did you hear that?
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous.  I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
You can go out there if you like...
Dr. Mumford.
I know I shoulda come to your office. I was gonna, actually, but then when you walked in here today...
That's it -- syndrome. So you know all about it?
Hello, Mr. Cook. I was wondering if Sofie was around?
Her friend from the city came and took her out to dinner. First time in a long time she's been willing.
Interesting approach. What was his name?
Why not?
Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come --
You find it distasteful, don't you?
We got divorced.  I had to get rid of her. She couldn't satisfy me.
Let me just say something here... I have no idea if this is going to help.
I didn't see you there. Can I help you?
I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars?
I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- "I treated myself too well."
We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc?
Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000.
Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
What do you want to know?
They come through a few times each year.  Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again!  It's a tour.
Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Hello, Lionel.
I just got my license two weeks ago.
What's happening here?
Ph.D., psychologist.
What'd you want?
Finally, some common sense...
I think you know what I mean.
Well... you see, the problem is --
Just who is here, can you tell me?
When did you start to feel this way?
Mom's such a cutie.
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
There... I've given myself a real whopper.
You're doing great.
It doesn't matter. Go on.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Is that when you split up?
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to.  Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
Is it something you've heard about me?
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
You got off easy.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
Don't do that thing...  ...that shrink thing.
Pro boner?  Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew!  The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
I've got three big ones.
Skip, you must have lots of people you can throw a ball with.
Skip, you're the head of the whole deal here. Are they busier than you?
Hell yes, I like it. What's better than this? Most guys would kill just to have someone do this with them whenever they like.
Lives downstairs from me. She's got a great dog named for Danny Ainge.
So I guess Henry Follett is a patient of yours. He's my pharmacist.
I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got.
Sounds like kind of a good idea.
Of course, him being insane didn't make it all right that I fell in love with his wife.
"Get to know your therapist."
And the drugs?
I know it starts with a birth certificate...
And a birth certificate is enough?
Psych major?
Pretty creepy, huh? Are you totally disgusted?
This doesn't seem a little... perverse?
I trained in the east, myself -- Cornell -- and I don't care what anyone says, there really are regional differences. I found the state certification exams out here quite harrowing... Did you?
Which examiner did you have? I probably know him.
I told you to leave or die, you refused, and now you may have killed us all. For you have unleashed the creature that we have feared for more than four thousand years.
And what ritual would that be?
And how does one do that?
What then? Robbery? Extortion? Kidnapping!
The Prince does not like to be touched by other humans. A Silly eastern superstition, I'm afraid.
Then you got no excuse for living. What the hell you doin, being buddies with this creep, Beni? What's in it for you?
...and how do you say? Those slimy things, in your stomach?
You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
I'm thinking that if the black Book Of The Dead can bring people back to life --
She is like all the others. She will die in the desert.
You think it'll send this guy back to hell?
See! That proves it! Old Seti's fortune's gotta be under this sand!
Two hundred pounds.
Do you realize, we are standing inside a room that no one has entered in over four thousand years.
No?
Could you tell me how to get there? The exact location?
There's something out there, you know, something under that sand.
Relax! I'm the map!  It's all up here.
For what?
According to Bembridge Scholars, inside the statue of Anubis was a secret compartment, perhaps containing The Book Of The Living.
Oh my god, It's a preparation room.
A key! That's it! That's what he was talking about.
Seems the Americans had a little misadventure of their own today, three of their diggers were killed.
I'm going to kiss you, Mister O'Connell.
According to my readings, our friend suffered the HOM-DAI, the worst of all ancient Egyptian curses, one reserved for only the most evil blasphemers. In all of my research, I've never read of this curse actually having been performed.
Yes, they never used it because they feared it so. It's written, that if a victim of the HOM-DAI should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of Egypt.
Having an encounter with a four thousand year old walking-talking corpse tends to convert one.
No we are not. We woke him up, and we must try and stop him.
It's everybody's problem!
That's what I am to you? A contract?
I think you were jealous
Got it!
Don't do it, Evelyn.
Jonathan?
Two questions. Who the hell is Seti the First? And was he rich?
Ah, begging your pardon, but shouldn't we be going?
Ummm, Hootash im... Hootash im now what is this last symbol here?
That thing gives me the creeps.
Tough break.
He certainly was not a popular fellow when they planted him.
Damn-it! That's two down and only two to go.
Okay, now what the hell does this Horus guy look like?
I knew you'd come. I left that skylight open for you.
I knew you'd know.
Um-hmm.
Where are you going?
What are you doing all alone in the dark?
Our guests are waiting.
The Bowler? I remember him from when I was a kid. He was killed years ago.
Look, honey, being a superhero... it's a guy thing.
We didn't think this through very well.
Much less go outside.
We could really use some coffee --
Hey, do I look like a Man?
And you can't count Horst Buckholtz anyway.
Hey... Can I buy you a beer?
How's your dad?
He'll never make it.
Have you considered my offer?
I hope you won't take this the wrong way, but I couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for Veronica Lake in "The Blue Dahlia".
Me too... I love this stupid old town. It's noisy. It's smelly. It's falling apart.
I've thought of leaving, going to Chicago or New York, but...
I'm going inside.
Come on, guys -- we're fighting against evil.
Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
I'm liking this.
This place is built like a fortress.
GET MAD!
He's Lance Hunt! Just take off the glasses -- and it's him!
What does it matter? Women just want to control you -- and talk about their feelings. They want to know why you're angry all the time -- and what can they can do to help -- so you tell them there's nothing -- nothing -- just leave me alone -- but they bug you and they bug you and they bug you -- until you just can't stand it anymore! -- so you finally open up -- you pop like a blister -- and it all comes spewing out -- all your emotions -- your feelings -- your fears -- all of it!  And then they dump you.
Maybe she's right.
The Obliterators!
Yes, Obie-wan.
So you're like... struggling superheroes?
So what can I get you?
It's on the television.
I use it... to fight evil.
This is bad.
We may be getting in over our heads here.
Don't crunch the leaves.
Be a Mohican.
Do we have to?
And there's the Sphinx.
But, Doc... where's the machine guns?
Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
We've got lift off!
Where am I going?
Your Majesty, I have been advised that you have received a letter from Napoleon, offering a peace treaty, and that you have decided to accept it.
But, since the fire, a completely new spirit has been aroused in the nation.  The French have become an army of criminals, against whom Russia must be avenged, against whom she is now prepared to fight to the death.
The point I was trying to make is that I think it is reasonable to say that Your Majesty would not find himself under unbearable pressure, if he decided to make peace with the Emperor, at least at this time.
I must confess he would look a bit silly, fighting his way to Moscow and turning right around again.
Proceed.
Yes, Captain?  Have you anything you wish to say?
There are none here.
I believe it was arranged by Marshals Mortier and Marmont.  I must explain to you that we have had no orders all day.  Each marshal has been keeping his own position.
I don't know what has happened to Prince Joseph.
This dispatch has just arrived from Aboukir, marked highest priority, for General Bonaparte's eyes only.
I believe you are acquainted with my brother, Joseph Bonaparte, and my aide, Major Junot.
Was it he who assigned you to command the escort which accompanied Madame Bonaparte's coach?
You will return to Paris tomorrow and you will carry my compliments and thanks to General Le Clerc for assigning such an excellent officer to carry out a responsibility which has meant so much to myself and to Madame Bonaparte.
Yes, sir?
I haven't been there for three years.
How did it spread so quickly?
I told Mortier that he would answer with his life for any looting.
I have met her.  What is your business with me?
A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
Oh...?
You must be chilled to the bone, standing out of doors like this.
No, I'm only here on leave.  My regiment is at Valence.
No... I have a... room... at the Hotel de Perrin.
She will probably appear with a dozen excuses and you will forgive her anyway.
Oh... how very nice of you to bring that for Eugene... Did General de Beauharnais give it to you?
And now?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Were they pretty?
Were any of them married?
Perhaps -- but tell me you promise, anyway.
Yes -- what is it?
How should I know.  Ask Roquier -- he's cleaning her dress.
Yes!!
But you will not... be safe...
Well, he didn't give it to me, and when I ask you to do something for me, return the work to me, not to Berthier.
I must have the breakdown now. Where is Berthier?
Well, maybe he's only looking out for your best interests.
You wrote it.
You could hear them?
How did you know it was Captain Charles?
I wanted to kill him but Joseph convinced me it would be a mistake. He said people would say you hadn't the courage to deal with it yourself.
May I inform you, monsieur, that I am Major Fidon, official courier to the court of the Emperor Napoleon, on my way to our Embassy at St. Petersburg and, in accordance with the rules of the road, no one may overtake or pass me.
And, where did you see my portrait?
Will I be able to play the harp?  It is an instrument of which I am very fond.
You are so good to me.  Will you also allow me to have a botanical garden?
I hope you have patience with me.  I do not know how to dance the quadrille but, if you desire it, I will learn.
Has Alexander agreed to this?
What I am talking about is moderation.
Sire, you have only enemies in the court of St. Petersburg, and I fear outside your influence, Alexander will have another look at what he has agreed to.
A revolution is not a polite discussion in a parlor, Citizen Lieutenant.  One does not call it murder to kill such vermin.
Citizen Lieutenant, my advice is to leave this town at once with your men.  We do not wish to do harm to our brothers in uniform.
Napoleon would soon arouse the resentment of the Directory in Paris, exceeding his authority, making political decisions and treaties like a Roman Conqueror, enlarging his role to ruler of Italy.  Only his tremendous success and ever increasing popularity prevented the Directory from replacing him.
On December 2, 1804, Napoleon was made Emperor of France.  He would later say:  "I found the crown lying in the gutter and I picked it up."
On January 1st, 1814, France itself was invaded.  Now, with a small army of raw recruits, Napoleon would have to face the powerful combination of England, Russia, Prussia and Austria, operating against him together, for the first time.  The balance of numbers had tilted irretrievably against him.
Yeah, you gotta have a little money to live out here, Craig.  I never thought I'd be the kinda nigga to move to the suburbs.  But as soon as I got my check, I was gone.  Paid 230 thousand dollars cash on this house.
That's okay, Unc.  I can't swim, either.
I don't know, I think I passed out or something.  I don't remember.
Me, too.  You think they're in there?
Where you going?
Great moves, Day-Day.
What you mean talk to her?
Me neither.
Dude, dogs hate me.  I don't know why. Me and K-9's just don't get along.
Nobody!
Who is that?
They ever let you hit the switches on that Cadillac?
She pepper-sprayed me, man!  She pepper- sprayed me!
What?
Restraining order?  Where the hell you meet this girl?
$247.
I didn't think you smoked bud that much.
You better open up a window or something before the smell gets out.
It works.
This vacuum don't work.  Where's the restroom?
Alright, Roach, see you around.
How you know?  It could be anything.
You go first.
You go first.
Day-Day, if you don't hop that fence I'mma throw you over.
Karla.
You want us to give you a ride?
Thanks for noticing.  It used ta be peaceful before they got out.  Took over the house and caused my mother's nervous breakdown.
Next time, page me first.
Delivery!
What's the matter?
Yeah, I'm 'bout it.
No, give me my damn money back.  Right now, and I don't have no damn receipt neither.
That the big one, huh?
What was that?
Are they still out there?
Yoooo, that's it.  You ain't as dumb as I think you are, Roach.
Hey.
Finally you got a bitch, huh, Roach?
Hey, guys, I'm outta here.
Hey, man, the pleasure's all mine. Thanks for the dog, and the money.  Maybe my dad won't kick my ass tonight.
Wet your eyes, boy.  Stay in there for about 20 minutes.
When my back gets better I'mma beat the black off you, Day-Day.
Uh...um...I mean uh, can we borrow a cup of sugar?
Rancho Cucamonga?
Just do it.
We must be here 'cause we stopped.
Hey, how you get out of here.
Somebody left me a message.  Well where's Craig and Day-Day?
You come way out here to get into more trouble.  You could've stayed at home.
My back.
Well, we better hit the road, too. Craig, get your stuff.
Elroy, what happen?
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
During a campaign every speech is important. This is free media exposure. Primetime news coverage that we couldn't buy.
Don't remind me.
I appreciate that.
If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already.
I remember you...in the elevator.
For what?
Good luck.
Is this about those kids? Look, I'm sorry about that. But they darn near...
Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt.
Yes, yes, I understand.
This'11 get you in anywhere.  Red Elevator. Thirty-fifth floor.
Are you 'fucking with me!?
He's dead?
Come back.
Again.
I talk to her or you can forget about it.
Who is this? Are you sure we can trust him?
So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that?
Lynn!
I have to do something.
It's a twenty.
You remember me?
Please...
Cover your mouth.
This gorilla's watching you, is that right?
Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it?
Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that?
I'm not a baby.
I've got something for you.
Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em.
Come Back.
Put her on.
Listen to me son. You got to swear. Swear means promise. First swear you'll take care of little Pearl. Guard her with your life, boy. Then swear you won't never tell where that money's hid. Not even your Mom.
You got common sense. She ain't. When you grow up that money'll be yours. Now swear. "I will guard Pearl with my life..."
'Twas down at Cresap's Landing, Along the River Shore, Birdie Steptoe was a Pilot in the good old days of yore. Now he sets in his old wharf-boat...
Leavin', boy?
Won't he bust it, Uncle Birdie?
The Lord said, Take that money and throw it in the River!
How's your own boy, Miz Cooper?
There's somethin' wrong about it, Mother.
What's wrong, Mother?
Who?
There's a little peach brandy -- maybe a sip?
Sure, but you was worried too, Mother; takin' off with never a word of goodbye. I even got to figurin' them gypsies busted in and done off with all three of 'em.
Pearl dotes on him.
I burned it.  I tore it up and burned it -- it stank so strong of hellfire.
I tried to save her.
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
John...
Where's Mom?
Someone is after us, Pearl.
I'm hungry, John.
Get in the skiff, Pearl, goodness, goodness, hurry!
Don't you hurt her!
Story, honey? Why, what story?
John, when your Dad says 'come', you should mind him.
I'll see to Pearl.
Why, he told me what fine little lambs you and your sister both was.
Married! We have decided to go to Sistersville tomorrow, and when we come back --
Tell me what, boy?
What are you doing, boy?
I thought I told you to keep your mouth shut --
You don't reckon I'd leave you.
Pearl, shut up! Pearl, you swore!
Now it's your turn.
You see? We can't have anything to do with John.  You and me will go down to the parlor.
John's bad.
You're Ruby, ain't you, my child?
The first night?
What do you figure to do?
John: take that look offen your face and act nice.
Get up, Willa.
What's wrong, John?
He never asked me for nothin'.
What the hell are dreams, anyway?
How can you tell?
Oh my god, oh my god...
Worked like a charm.
You okay?
Guess I did.
You ever read about the Balinese way of dreaming?
And what if they meet a monster in their dream? Then what?
What happens if they don't do that?
Hello?
Bring him out of what?
How you plan to do that?
You crazy? Hit him with what?
Hello Nancy.
I've got a proposition for you. Listen very carefully, please.
Did you sleep?
Nancy, don't fall asleep in there.
What?
I must be going nuts...
What I learned at the dream clinic, that's what I'm trying to prove. Rod didn't kill Tina, and he didn't hang himself. It's this guy -- he's after us in our dreams.
It's real, Mamma. Feel it.
Feeling better?
Your old man thinks I did it, don't he?
The cops were all over my house.  They'll kill me for sure.
No more fights?
Thank you, Comrade.
Aren't you late?
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
An evening gown.
Yes.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You feel it, though.
You want this?
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look...  The service in this hotel is terrible!  See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
Which lawyer?
Comrade Buljanoff...
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
The former Duchess!
Good evening, Gaston.
Your breakfast, monsieur.
I guess it is eight forty-two.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
I want you to know all the White Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her countrymen.
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
Good evening, Your Highness.
Certainly, Your Highness, this way please... Count d'Algout made the reservation this afternoon.
Is this satisfactory?
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
Let's do that.
...des petites fraises des bois... de la crème de Bretagne... 
If you want to see us you must come later.
And if we have to go to Siberia...
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
Yes, monsieur?
I might be able to accommodate you. Is there some more luggage?
I'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...
We may have a chance.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
If there is anything we can do for you...
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous!  Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
Don't hold that against me... please!
Private.
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
You, please.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Then you don't want me to go there.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
I will start with you.
Don't do it, please.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how?  By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice.  When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Will you smile?
On which boat?
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
How do you do?
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Go on.
Comrades! Comrades!
Not white, darling.
And we won't stretch up our arms...
...and we won't clench our fist...
Would that make you any happier?
No music.
Hello, Leon!
Did you win?
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
You haven't seen her yet?
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
Thank you.
Yes, Swana, you did.
Yes, Swana.
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
Hello, Leon darling!
Now, please, Swana.
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
You leave me no choice.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
It's just a place for workmen.
Your Highness, forgive this intrusion, but...
Sir, the charges are serious -- first, abuse of power; second, obstruction of justice; third, failure to cooperate with Congress; and last, bombing Cambodia ...
We'll see about that ...
How much do you need?
I agree it's ridiculous but --
You want me to put it all in writing? Over my signature?
The President would like to know if that was the last payment.
Is it?
To protect his people.
Let's not forget they're just kids, they don't vote.
Sure, they did stuff, but nothing like this, Bob.  Forget Watergate, the break-ins, the Enemies list.  You got an attempted firebombing at the Brookings Institution, planting McGovern stuff on the guy that shot Wallace, trying to slip LSD to Jack Anderson.
Colson doesn't know about it; he's pure as a virgin on this one.  It's just not clear the burglars knew what they were looking for.  They were heading to McGovern's office later that night.
Martha's an idiot, she'll do anything to get John's attention.  If Mitchell'd been minding the store instead of that nut Martha we wouldn't have that kid Magruder runnin' some third-rate burglary!  Was he smoking pot?
McCord? ...
I don't have time for all this shit!  Just handle it, Bob!  Keep it out of the White House.  What else? Kissinger's waiting -- he's gonna throw a tantrum again if I don't see him, threatening to quit ... again. 
We can't touch Hoover --
The country's loving it.
I end the longest war in American history and they keep harping on this chickenshit!  You know who's behind this, don't you -- it's Teddy Kennedy! He drowns a broad in his car and he can't run for president.
Let 'em try!  I appointed three of those bastards!  I'm not giving 'em my tapes!
Who the fuck does Cox think he is?  I never made a dime from public office!  I'm honest.  My dad died broke.  You know the sonofabitch went to law school with Jack Kennedy? ... The last gasp of the Establishment! They got the hell kicked out of 'em in the election, so now they gotta squeal about Watergate 'cause we were the first real threat to them in years. And by God, Al, we would have changed it, changed it so they couldn't have changed it back in a hundred years, if only ...
June twenty-third, '72, sir.  The part that's underlined.  Your instructions to Haldeman regarding the CIA and the FBI.
We can't survive this, sir.  They also have you instructing Dean to make the payoff to Hunt.
Sir, you talked about opening up the whole "Bay of Pigs" thing again.
He works for Colson.  He used him on the Pentagon Papers.  We're trying to figure out when he officially stopped being a White House consultant.  After the arrest he dumped his wiretapping stuff into his White House safe.
Well, why not?
Bob, did I approve the Ellsberg thing? You know, I'm glad we tape all these conversations because ... I never approved that break-in at Ellsberg's psychiatrist.  Or maybe I approved it after the fact?  Someday we've got to start transcribing the tapes.
Play it tough.  That's the way they play it and that's the way we're going to play it.  Don't lie to Helms and say there's no involvement, but just say this is sort of a comedy of errors, bizarre, without getting into it.  Say the President believes it's going to open up the whole Bay of Pigs thing again.  Tell Helms he should call the FBI, call Pat Gray, and say that we wish for the sake of the country -- don't go any further into this hanky-panky, period!
Just do what I say, Bob.
Christ, you're right -- Gray makes Jerry Ford look like Mozart.  Just have Helms call him.  Helms can scare anybody.
It's got nothing to do with justice. It's national security.
... When we consider the lineup of the world, we find there are 590 million people on our side, 800 million on the Communist side, and 600 million who are neutral.  The odds are 5 to 3 against us ...
I think ... I think ... that's the sort of very dangerous and irresponsible suggestion that ... helping the Cuban exiles who oppose Castro would, uh ... not only be a violation of international law, it would be ...
I don't understand.  Track 2's Chile?
The first assassination attempt was in '60, just before the election.
He didn't veto it.  I ran the White House side.  The mob contact was Johnny Roselli.  One of the CIA guys was that jackass, Howard Hunt.
... and we've got the economic guys at five.  The Dow lost another 16 points. They're going to want a decision on the budget.  Sir?  ... Are we holding the line on a balanced budget?
I see ... Well then, Richard, we have nothing more to talk about, do we?
What'd he say?
What'd you say?
Mom expects great things from you ...
I'm honored, Dick, that you've come all this way out here to Virginia to visit us at last.
Of course we've tried, but so far we've come up with nothing that ...
I'm sure you realize this is a very tricky area, Mr. President, given our charter and the congressional oversight committees ...
Not if I give you all the cards ...
And of course I accept.  I'm flattered.  And I want you to know, I work for only one president at a time.
CIA policy?  The CIA has no policy, Mr. Helms.  Except what I dictate to you ...  I try to adjust to the world as it is today, not as you or I wanted it to be ten years ago.
No.
Ummm...
Roselli?  Johnny Roselli?
The little bastards think they can ruin Tricia's wedding day by dancing naked in the Reflecting Pond.
Yeah, you do.  I'd be bugging myself, Edgar ... Who'd get the tapes?
Who we working for?
Where'd you find him?
So, does Tricky Dick know about this?
Mein Kampf?
So, what's this about, Dick?
It looks like to me we're gonna lose the war for the first goddamned time and, Dick, goddamn it, you're going along with it, buying into this Kissinger bullshit -- "detente" with the Communists.  "Detente" -- it sounds like two fags dancing.
Fuck it!  He doesn't like me, John!  It's your fault, Henry.
Housecleaning?  It would be ugly, Henry, really ugly ...
... Uh, I hope this doesn't embarrass you.
Do you miss Cuba, Manolo?
You know, I voted for you in your last election.
Rocky's full of shit!  No way he's going to get nominated west of the Hudson with a new wife.  He's gonna be drinking Scotches in retirement at some goddamn country club with the rest of the Republicans.
Uh, wait ...
Jesus Christ!
Hi, I'm Dick Nixon.
The Orangemen!  Now there's a football program.  Jim Brown.  And that other tailback ... The one with the blood disease ...
... I don't really know you yet, Sandy ... What do you like?  I mean, what kind of clothes do you like?  Do you like blue ... red?
Yeah ... Guy Lombardo ...
... but it depends on what I'm doing to the music, Dick ...
Someone wants it ...  You can't stop it, can you?  Even if you wanted to.  Because it's not you. It's the system.  And the system won't let you stop it ...
We got the press this time!
We gotta make 'em think we're just as tough as they are -- that Nixon's a mad bomber, he might do anything!  I played a lot of poker in World War II , and I won big, and let me tell you this -- unpredictability is our best asset.  That redneck Johnson left me with a shitty hand and I'm bluffing.  I've got to play the hawk in Vietnam and the dove in China. And if we keep our heads, we can win this thing.
But what am I telling the press about Kent State?
No, they want you, Mr. President.  I really think it would be a good move.
You know, Fred, they sell tickets.
We lost ...
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Amen to that.
What are you saying?  What are you talking about?
I'll do it.  No more.
Were you planning to tell me?
You're the strongest woman I ever met. I love you, Buddy.
Yeah, sure, a long time ago.
Yes!  This is about me.  Why can't you understand that, you of all people? It's not the war -- it's Nixon!  They want to destroy Nixon!  And if I expose myself even the slightest bit they'll tear my insides out.  Do you want that?  Do you want to see that, Buddy?  It's not pretty.
No, I don't.  I'm not Jack ...
Yes.
What exactly did you want to discuss, Pat?
I remember Alger Hiss.  I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything.  But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them.  Because you have absolutely no remorse.  No concept of remorse.  You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
Won or lost?
But being out of the game gives me time to write.
What?
Well, in any case, Rocky, I'll send you my book.  "Six Crises."
How'd you know I was here.
You heard my -- you havin' fun with me?
How many a those things you got now?
What would you a done if he'd been released?
...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'.
How come're you doin that?
Nineteen zero and nine.
I thought maybe she was with your boy there.
Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow.
He is just a goddamn homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.
Yes ma'am?
...You ride Winston.
That's the boy.
Sheriff, that's aggravating.
How's that, Sheriff?
Yessir.
It ain't even three years we been married.
I put it in, Mama.
Did you buy that gun?
What'd you give for that thing?
Llewelyn.
So... for how long do we have to...
Llewelyn --
Why all the way to Del Rio?
You can't afford one?
Promise?
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Llewelyn?
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
Do you have any idea how goddamn crazy you are?
Well I'd say he's at work. Do you want to leave a message?
I can't say.
Huh? What is...
...You getting anything on this?
Airport.
Who is this.
...I know where you are.
You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going?
You know how this is going to turn out, don't you?
What way would that be?
What business is it of yours where I'm from, friendo?
...Will there be somethin' else?
Is somethin' wrong?
With anything?
You don't know what you're talking about, do you?
...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss?
Yes.
You need to call it. I can't call it for you. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't even be right.
Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over.
What kind of tent?
You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on?
Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms.
November the 28th, last year.
We got a loose cannon here. And we're out a bunch of money, and the other party is out his product.
...I'm wondering...
No, I want to keep my room, and get another one.
Waitin' for my wife.
Half.
Lookin' for what's comin'.
It's called a transponder.
What did you do?
Cast iron?
Maybe he should be worried. About me.
The heroin. You don't have it.
...I'm across the river. At the Hotel Eagle. Carson Wells.  Call me when you've had enough. I can even let you keep a little of the money.
No no. No. You don't understand. You can't make a deal with him. Even if you gave him the money he'd still kill you. He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that. He's not like you. He's not even like me.
Are you in the service?
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
It wasn't a woman.
I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess...  How's things at the Tip Top?
You must be joking.
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
Wait. Let me get this out.  I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
You can start tomorrow. And don't say a word about this to anyone.  Is that issue?
The LeSabre!
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
I gotta go.
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know...  ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her...  Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
Thanks...
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
You're in serious danger!
What's the matter here?
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Where you headed, Betty?
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
How did you know?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
What are those for?
You should have a little faith in people.
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.
Really. And where was that, old man?
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
That's right.
That is so right.
Now, that's really stupid.
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
We can live with that.
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying.  First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
What in the...  What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
Thank you for your cooperation.  Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
Really?
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
She's even taken a job as a nurse!  David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Yeah? The sport utility?
Because it ain't natural, young man.
You're wastin' your time, Roy.
No... before that.
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
I like to think that I'm a pretty astute observer of the human scene.
End of the road, boys. It's had its twists and turns -
Waitaminute -
You got light fingers, Everett. Gopher?
Why don't we bed down out here tonight?
...Pete?
How'd he know about the treasure?
Preacher said my sins are warshed away, including that Piggly Wiggly I knocked over in Yazoo!
Don't be a fool, Everett, we gotta R- U-N-O-F-F-T, but pronto!
Whuhh...
What on earth is goin' on here! What's got into you, Delmar!
Deceitful! Two-faced! She-Woman! Never trust a female, Delmar! Remember that one simple precept and your time with me will not have been ill spent!
Scuse me... scuse me... we're the next act...
A miracle! It was a miracle!
We ain't one-at-a-timin' here, we mass communicatin'!
Pullin' ah pants down...
Helluva idea.
No one says no to Pappy O'Daniel.
That ain't your daddy, Alvinelle. Your daddy was hit by a train.
No - you stop it! Vernon here's got a job. Vernon's got prospects. He's bona fide! What're you?
Huh?! They dam that river on the 21st.  Today's the 17th!
Me? Oh, I didn't have no plan. Still don't, really.
...Nah, that ain't right... I'm thinkin' of...
Fact of the matter - there never was!
Pete... I do apologize.
No! I don't want Fop! Goddamnit - I use Dapper Dan!
Sir, we are Negroes. All except our a-cump- uh, company-accompluh- uh, the fella that plays the gui-tar.
Hot damn, boy, I almost believe you did sell your soul to the devil!
Now what can I do you for, Mister French?
I signed that bill! I signed a dozen a those aggi-culture bills! Everyone knows I'm a friend a the fahmuh! What do I gotta do, start diddlin' livestock?!
Mama said you was hit by a train!
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
Hi, Byron.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
Who gave you this idea?
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
Who's that?
Great ass.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Hi, son.
What did you call me?
What did you call me, Mayo?
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
Yes I do!
Vietnam?
Something tells me you've been here before.
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
How late?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side.  So how late are you, Lynette?
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
That was you guys, huh?
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Lynette, where's Sid?
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
There's always a choice.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
You stayed after all.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
I'd like to come with you.
I'll never get it polished in time. Give me a buckle, Zack.
You'd make it. He's just getting to the girls. Come on, Zack. I gotta see my family, man. I couldn't take it if he keeps me here over the weekend.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
Hey, you guys still awake?
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died.  I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
Do you know that for sure?
No problem.
There is not one thing funny here.
He said open it.
Th --
YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GONNA GO!
Fuck.
I mean, right?  Isn't it?
Where did you get this clown?
It's still a good plan.  It's just... got a twist.
When you said you'd let 'em go I thought she'd come running right out for sure.
Cell phone.
I mean it!
Yeah?
Can we come in?
I don't have to tell you there is an acute shortage of living space in Manhattan right now and this is a highly unique property.
Watch your mouth.
Cut it back a little bit.
We're not gonna do anything about him, he's fine.
We're leaving.
Suit yourself.
Makes me nervous.
Ever read any Poe?
Old Bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?
Shoulda got an apartment.
The phone works.  Hey, I hooked up the phone.
I heard you.
We're never getting out of here.
Call Dad!
He'll know we're in trouble.  He heard me, I said "There are three..."
I'm sorry.
Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay?  Can you hear me?
Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
Alma!? I uhh I don't think...
Uhh... I with it sister but...
Those ain't cops.
Alma I told you to...
No...
Free? We're back where we started. Shit we still don't have a stop light.
This brothers is gonna be a colossal event. We'll shut the mother down right at the capitol, in front of the cameras.  Will you cool it? What's up man? What it be Bobby?
What? We're the leadership, you and me. There ain't enough of us to...
You got six months to donate to the party, Bobby?
You got to sit on Eldridge...
Get out of the car.
What are you crazy?
Inspector Brimmer
Check it out... Great huh? I tell you those guys know what time it is. Man I'm with that...
C'mon Judge we got to start somewhere.
Don't I know it. Come on in Agent Rodgers. Sit down. Always a... pleasure to see you. How can I be of help?
Now hold on Rodgers...
I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...
These are memos from the commissioner, the mayor and Hoover himself, putting the Black Panthers and their subversive activities under the full jurisdiction of the Bureau.
The time, my friend, is what Sartre called, "the moment the match is being put to the fuse." Question is, is the hand holding that match gonna be black or white.
Shit, nothing but Paper Panthers.
C'mon let's...
Yeah man, but where's Judge?
Welcome brother, have you decided to get down with us?
Hey, GI bill pays for school. And shit, if I stuck around here, instead of signing up, I'd probably be in jail, or sitting on the stoop drinking Bitter Dog with Rose, you know?
What it be Judge. Nobody got hurt, Sister Betty's safe. This was a good day...
What's the pig's name?
You got to keep very cool on this. Icy god damn cool. Cause baby, you just became the strongest weapon we got. Let me guess, he wants you to call him, tell him what we're doing.
Man, this shit's pretty thick.
I don't know man. I don't know. That reminds me.  Another little donation from the police.
Yeah well, they want a lot for their money. They want a felony, preferably with "violent intent." We've got to give them something. They'll kill me if I don't. And the Panthers are going to kill me if I do. I'm scared.
I thought you said all the Panthers were gonna be here.
Busted firing pin.  You want only the legal stuff right?
You got something on your mind... "brother."
Fuck is up?!
The pigs are gonna start flooding us with dope. Huey wants us to stop them.
Chickenshits? What you bring your buddies with you?
You supposed to be a wounded vet, Motherfucka. What you do in 'Nam anyway, shoot gooks or shoot hoops?
My Mom's at that.
Judge... I... I shoulda told you this before but... well... fuck...
God damn it's him. I gotta go.
Yeah... cop hit me...
I hear them boys, those Black Panthers, they're communists. They don't even believe in God.
You believe that?
Congratulations.
Maybe we'll be lucky this winter and have just rain, no snow.
You expect to hold Cornwallis with militia?
Well?
He reminds me of you before you got old and ugly.
You don't know him very well, do you?
I know him well enough?
You got salt last week.
And send us to war alongside Massachusetts.
Of course, I do.
Goodbye, Charlotte.
Please forgive me for keeping you waiting.
Thank you.
Very well, let us move on to...
I do have eighteen criminals under sentence of death, but I hold no prisoners-of-war.
My harrier.  Join us, Colonel.
What news?
Father, I've lost respect for you. I thought you were a man of principle.
Father...
How old are you?
We buried them, then we went to track.  It was a cold trail and they were moving fast.  We went faster. We caught up to them at Kentucky Ford.
An American nation.  Colonel Lee, with your permission?
Those of us who call ourselves Patriots are not seeking to give birth to an American nation, but to protect one that already exists.  It was born a hundred-and-seventy years ago at Jamestown, Virginia and has grown stronger and more mature with every generation reared and with every crop sown and harvested.  We are a nation and our rights as citizens of that nation are threatened by a tyrant three thousand miles away.
Damn it, Francis!  How in God's name do you expect to gain independence without going to war?
And Patriots will start dying on the gallows instead of the battlefield.  Unless we can keep Cornwallis in the South until the French arrive.  A treaty was signed at Versailles after our victory at Saratoga.  The French are sending a fleet and ten thousand troops.
The bigger problem is where, not when.  The French fleet won't sail north of the Chesapeake for fear of early storms.
Not me, you.  I'm going north with every Continental regular I can find to reinforce Washington or he won't last six weeks.
They'd be better off, but the cause wouldn't be.
Goodbye, Francis.
How far away?
Reverend.
It's a good measure of a woman that she'll have her honeymoon under the stars.
Colonel, let us help his soul find it's place with the Almighty and...
Seventeen.
Father?
Father, you can't let them take him...
Do you know what this place is, Ellie? Oh, I know you know it's a boneyard, but a bone ain't nothing and even a whole pile of 'em don't amount to much. Do you know what a graveyard really is?
Honey, Church will be fine.
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
No-I guess not.
And that someone cared enough about that animal to mark the spot.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
I don't know, honey. Different people believe all sorts of different things happen to us when we die. Some believe in heaven or hell. Some think we're born again as little children--
Well, it's actually reincarnation, but you get the idea. And some people think we just wink out...like a candle flame when the wind blows hard.
I think we go on. I'm not sure what happens after we die, but yeah-- I have faith in that.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
Was it Pascow?
The one that goes into the woods--sure.
Who owns the woods up ahead? Paper companies?
It's Church.
Bagged cat. What a mess.
No need to apologize.
But--
What do you mean?
We can't climb over that. We'll break our necks!
You want to rest a bit before you start?
Doesn't look like they last long.
But--
I most generally don't start before noon, but this looks like an exception.
You and this old Indian rag-man--
I'll bite--what's the bottom of the truth, Jud?
Please, I want to wake up. Leave me alone. It's not my fault you died; you were as good as dead when they brought you in--
I'll tell you where the ground is sour--the ground in my heart is sour. Let me tell you something else, Vic-baby: Wrong is wrong.
And Buckaroo Banzai.
Gage's gone!
Thank you. Thank you so much.
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
I heard you tonight.
I'm going to try to do better.
You better get going, hon.
AnaMaria, trim the mainsail!
I know whose blood you need, to end the curse.
Blast you!  I'll throw you in prison.
I'll watch my back.
No, I really think I do.
Like after you've killed ... Every ... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men.
That's proper, sir, according to the code.
I am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.  Means 'No.'
You have a name, missy?
And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that?  A family heirloom, perhaps?
Agreed.  You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune --
I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate.
Man overboard!
You're speaking up for him again?
Commodore, I beg you -- please do this ... for me.  As a wedding gift.
Actually, I find it all fascinating.
It's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion?
I could never forget it, Miss Swann.
Why would my father send this to me?
It doesn't!
You are despicable.
Has it changed since the last time you were here?
Captain Sparrow!  We have to get off this island -- immediately!
Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl.
We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few--
All the men in place, sir.  Ready to fire.
Dead serious.
Agreed.  You have the momentary advantage, sir.  But I will see you smile from the yard arm, sir.
This dock is off-limits to civilians.
What's your name?
Move!
Where does it make berth?
The ship's real enough.  So its anchorage must be a real place. Where is it?
Why are brothering with that?
Everybody stay calm.  We're taking over the ship!
For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study.
Put it away, Will.  It's not worth getting beat again.
But I survived.  And I still have that single shot.  It's meant for one man.  My mutinous first mate--
What's that?
Jack!
There's no *real* ship as can match the Interceptor.
He may be.
That Jack Sparrow ... he talked about the Black Pearl.
Has my daughter given you an answer yet?
Mr. Sim, when you do locate him.  Do not scare him off again.  Just watch him.  I think you can handle that. Right, Mr. Sim?
Dr. Argon, everything's starting to come apart here.  You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am trying, but elements are making my job impossible.
The body is just another part of nature and ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O'Brien, and science is our greatest weapon against her.
It remains to be seen who is the good guy and who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.
She's working as fast as she can, Icarus.  It will be ready soon.
It works, Poppy.  It works, it works!
Yes, that's true.  We have to find him, run tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.
Oh no.  No.  We'll get her assistant.  What's-his-name? Nebbishman?
Look at me, Icarus!  Look at my body.  I've done everything, changed anything you asked me to.  'We will always love most that which we create.'  Is that still true?
Then you still love me?
She could have given him something to stimulate his kidneys.
They're here!  They're here!  We have the nanobot.
Here, kid, this is great stuff.  Why don't you give it a try?
Haw-haw!  Why don't you run off and find a cop and I'll wait right here.
Yeah.  I knew him when I was still in school.
Of course, sir.
I don't believe this is happening...
Is that what Argon told you?
Susan!
Really?  What have you been doing?
Somebody has to.
But you've polymerized single-celled bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
So right now there's little replicators spreading throughout Argon's lab?
Lungs sound fine.  You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you?  Allergies? Infections?
Is something wrong?
You have no one to blame but yourself.
Do you have something to bring me down?
I could go with you.
No cheese.
That's pretty good.
That's going to fit me?
You made this out of my hair?
Argon's private lab.
You saved my life.
We've got to get the nanobot.
Things do change.
What?  I'm not going anywhere!
Oh yeah, he's alive.  Technically.
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger.  If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
If you don't have any questions, I'll let you get back to doing your job.
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the building?
Exactly.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
I suppose you're going to print them?
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
Your place?
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Do you like them?
You wear them of course, silly.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
No? What do you look upon her as?
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
I'm not going!
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Ah-ah-ah!
Hello, there, Meadows![13]
Fine. Have a seat.
Yale '21, I believe.
Yeah!
Impossible. Put it on again.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
Big Chief Bingy come to white man's tepee to make friends. Big Chief very sorry. To show how sorry - will bend over and let white man kick Big Chief where sun never shines.
Yeah, little Gloria.
Right - for the first time this year.
Come on, get going, get going!
What play?
You're my what?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
That's a canary, sir.
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
Thanks, thanks.
My error.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Thanks. May I sit down?
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
Some bicarbonate - quick!
Heavens! The man's insane!
Shhh! Do you hear something?
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
Yes sir.
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ...  Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
You sure you want to know this?
Yes ...  It's just that ...
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Does it look okay?
Oh, hello Betty.
Having kind of a tough time.
Where'd you get this?
What?
No she's not.
It's alright. Let me see.
Like a drum.
I sure am glad you said you'd come out with me tonight Mary Sue.
So I know I haven't been steady with anybody, but I just don't want to rush it. You don't want to make a mistake with something that important.
... Why?
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
You want to ask her out tonight, right? And then you want to give her your school pin ...
Want some bridge mix?
Betty's making some pineapple kabobs ...
Wife wants him to get one of those new beds.
And that's why I want you to be on the Pleasantville Chamber of Commerce.
What happened?
You're not allowed to do this! I could arrest you for this.
Bud Parker and William Johnson, you have been charged with desecration of a public building and the intentional use of prohibited paint colors in violation of the Pleasantville Code of Conduct and laws of common decency. Do you admit that on the night of May 1, you did consciously and willfully apply the following FORBIDDEN colors to the Pleasantville Town Hall:  Red, Pink, Vermillion, Puce, Chartreuse, Umber, Blue, Aqua, Ox Blood, Green, Peach, Crimson, Yellow, Olive and Magenta.
I think I've got something to say.
What do you mean!?
You put handcuffs on them and you take them to the police station.
Hear your Dad got a new car.
No, not that hedge. The other one.
God, David. Just give it to me!
Noooooo!
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
They're happy like this.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
Are you sure?
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
No. I baked them for you.
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
Mmmmgh.
Yeah ... I guess.  I don't know.
How?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
What do we do?
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
You're gonna forget about me.
Okay, whose window did Bud break when he was playing with his father's golf clubs?
You're unbelievable. You'll win this thing for sure. When is it on?
A thousand dollars ... And it's on all night?
Yeah ...
No. McIntire's. Remember:  "For the very best in men's attire, Head right down to McIntire's."
... See, every time I thought I'd found someone they'd turn out to disappoint me. They'd know the early episodes, but they wouldn't know the later ones ... They'd know all about Muffin but they wouldn't know about Bud ...
Why would I do that?
Because you're coming home. I'm gonna put this place back the way it was.
EXCUSE ME?
I don't know what went wrong. You answered every question. You knew every detail. The senior Prom ... McIntire's Department Store. We had all the same warm memories: Sock hops. The Church Social ...
You know, if this ever happens again, you can make the fries even if I haven't put out the napkins yet.
Well, usually I put out the burger and then you finish with the lettuce ...
Bud ...
Look. I thought we talked about this, I thought we said ...
TV repair.
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
Told you it was your lucky day. Bet you thought I was just a fan or something.
Dream come true, hunh?
Oh GOD ...
Well, I can't talk though --
Yes, I'll be there.
It's extension 215 if you want to try me back.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
I know.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
You're so scared.
Tell me why.
Yes.
No.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
No.
I'm horny, Jack, what about you?
I'm fine. Who is this?
I'm going to work.
Me?
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
Do you know them.
Hi.
What do you do with all this pudding?
Oh My God.
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
This is funny.
Who is it?
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
Are you learning how to play it?
That was good.
Have a good trip.
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
Where do you have to go?
For work.....
Yeah.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
If you wanted to call me back I could...
Ok.
Why?
I don't know.
I didn't do that.
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
The police are on their way.
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
Why don't you shut the fuck up?
Can we agree that that is that?
What's up?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Why you wearin' a suit?
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
What's up?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
Yes.
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Ok.
I'll see you there.
That's it.
Hello?
What did you say?
I'll go pay for my car.
Yeah.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
In part, yes.
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
I must grant him his last rites.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
It's no secret that you loved her.
Don't confuse one organ with another --
Go to hell!
NEVER!
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
You're a sentimental man.
And --?
I have.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
As for the author... shoot him.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
Here it is; the last chapter.
I'll plunder every lovely pore until you're week and cry "no more!"
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
You're more than a priest; you're an angel! Ain't he, Maddy?
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
It's a long story, this one.
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
I am eternally in your debt.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
This is neither the time nor the place --
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
How was I to know, my darling?
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
So you ever gonna do a picture?
That poor woman.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Then you explain it to me?!
I just want to understand--
You're not going to get another chance, boy! Look right at the monster and you tell him--
love them so much that they ought to love you back. Only you want love on your own terms. "
Tome it's a question of truth and illusion. Don't you get tired of the errant falsity in motion pictures?
Now, Orson, you know I'm just dyin' to see your picture and I know it's gonna be boffo, but you're writing about a publisher, right?
We find the man and then we dissect him-
Howard Hughes killed Jean Harlow?
Look at those hands. Those are the hands of an artist. A modern Caravaggio.
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree. . . "How big is it, all told? The estate?
Oh Christ...
Howard Hughes, he would just kill us. Hearst he would kill us and fuck everything we ever loved.
Where did he go? He hasn't had a screen credit in four years--
He'll destroy us.
What?
Cain -- like the Bible guy?
And I'm looking at them -- and they're all looking at me and I don't know who should pour the tea. '
I want you back
No, but I can imagine. What am I today? A "puny upstart" or a "spoiled dilettante" -- no, she wouldn't know how to spell that
This is just the first shot. Maestro. Sooner or later she's gonna use the word. And all those boys know that there is only one thing this country hates more than the coloreds and that's the Jews.
You know, all this nightmare we went through with Hearst. The whole thing... And in the end, probably no one will ever remember the picture anyway.
Very generous
You're going to destroy it
It's an awful title, of course, but I can't think of anything better. Someone came up with A SEA OF UPTURNED FACES -- which has a nice, grand ring to it -- and I thought of JOHN CITIZEN, USA but that strikes me as a bit Warner Brothers. Or, God forbid, Capraesque. I suppose AMERICAN will do for now but--
Pardon?
A "Z" and a "K" in the title. That would draw the eye. For the poster. I like that THE PRISONER OF ZENDA had a "Z" and a "P" and that worked--
Do WAR OF THE WORLDS as a feature and everyone's happy. You make some money and New York's happy and you have a track record and then we'll move on to KANE.
I think you better sit down
You know something, Orson, you haven't done anything but lie to me from the moment we met. But, ya know, I'd do it again in a second.
It's just not low enough. This is the scene. We have to look up at these two man as pillars soaring to the sky. As towering virtues in combat--
Oh, no--
You want to do the life of Jesus?
What is it with you? Can't you talk? You got like a funny attitude. I can't figure you out, Joey. What's with you and the quick answers? You wanna get outa here fast?
He's an embarrassment because Frankie and the other guys are expectin' me to do something about it, and I'm lookin' very bad. I can't deliver a kid from my own neighborhood. Why's he make it so hard on himself? He comes to me, I can make it easier for him.
What's up, Colonel?
I'm gonna kill him. That fuckin' jig's gonna wish he never came outa the jungle. You got any money?
J.R., glad you could make it.
You know?
C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
Yeah --
Go 'head.
Nah, she don't go with nobody. She's only 15 years old.
Probably. You know she talks to everybody, and not just him.
Ah, some piece of ass, I'm tellin' you.
You want us to wait for you?
Say what you're gonna say.
Say what you gotta say. Don't be a smart ass.
Whatcha doin'?
Maybe she's afraid you're gonna hit her so she can't talk to you the way she wants to.
See? That's all there was to it.
Except fall down like a normal person.
So eat just a little. You gotta eat something.
How's that?
You know, when you gave him a beatin'.
Didn't it have nothin' to do with me?
What?
You givin' me that look. I gotta accept your word, but if I find out anythin', I'm gonna kill somebody...
Did you ever fuck my wife?
I'm pulling out of next Wednesday's TV bout 'cause I can't make the weight. I'm fighting at light heavyweight, and I still can't make the weight.
He ain't hurting me, but I can't get him down.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
I can't find my ball.
Can you see it?
Are you sure we should be doing this?
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
Don't tell me "No." I saw you lookin' at him. Why, you like him?
In other words, you're not interested in him but you'd be interested in somebody else, right?
You don't kiss like that. Hello and goodbye, that's all you do.
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
I dunno.
Vickie, open up. I need to come in.
Can't you get the money from your friends?
How you feelin'? Ok? You feelin' good?
Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,  take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
No, you're his wife.
And you're drinking with them right now.
This is Doyle's house.
I'm hired 'til one. They went to dinner and maybe night-clubbing.
Bryce, the only man for this job is sitting right here in town.  Get me L. B. Jefferies.
Name me a better photographer.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
His wife took a trip.
By the way  what happened to your leg?
-- until yesterday morning.
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --"  He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
Jewelry?
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
Oh -- that phone call!  I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
For what?
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
I predicted it.
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
I knew it!
That's normal.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
He and his wife splitting up?
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
No.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
What do you need money for?
Yes.
Goodnight, you idiot.
How's your leg?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Yes.
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining  Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
Don't you ever have any problems?
So do I.
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
I wonder where he's going now?
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Chelsea 2-7099.  We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again.  I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Shut up. I'm all right.
Feel okay?
Machismo?
Just him.
Buzz Gundersen.
Sure.  It's fine.
I like you, you know?
You see any cops?
What time is it?
Tell him why we moved here.
You buy me many things.  Thank you.
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Just give me a direct answer!  You going to stop me from going, Dad?
Except yourself!
Whoa!  Whoa!  I know you're a little upset but--
Luck, Jim.  Don't forget.
Was it because we went to that party?  You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
Look Jim.  Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
Frank!
John Crawford?
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him.  It's very important.
He's not here.  He's not at Juvenile Hall.  I don't know where he is.  He's out on a call and he'll be out all night.  How old are you?
Hi.
No.  It's perpetual motion.
How'd you get here?
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
It's me!
Come out come out wherever you are!
We're safe here.  I hope.  What do you think?
I came here before.
What you run out on me for!  What you leave me alone for?
Plato?
That's swell.  How are you?
Why?
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
You promised to give it back.
Those aren't my friends.  Make them go away.
Plato!
What?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Too bad you didn't connect.  You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Sure it is.  You want to bug us till we have to lock you up.  Why?
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
If he could--
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
Hey!  That's enough static out of you.
You don't have to be unfriendly.
See?
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
See, I'm new.
Yeah--why--
Yeah.  So where's the high school?
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
They'll be looking for you.
No?  Why not?  You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb?
Where you going?
Ever been in a place like this before?
How many rooms do you think there are?
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Is he your friend?
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
Plato, where's your father now?
Judy--we're ready for you now.
What?
That one?
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way?  I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention.  Did you ever think of that?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
How did you know that?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Good evening.
Didn't you forget something?
A man of some travels.
Is this the fucker you been writing all year!?
All those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...
Saw me --
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
No, not that, no...  I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth.
We'll have more fun in Detroit.
I'M NOT NICK!  You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me!
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
Your pen palls dead, lady.
They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants!  I hate him, Nick... you know how...
Then they do need me, don't they. They really need me...
We get to the bridge, we're all right!
You saved my life.  You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
I love you, Nick...
They'll have guns.
He wants to see your map.
No.
I don't know where you're going. But I'm going home.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
You... you... YOU --
I saved your life.
What?
You said Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Who are you now.
Put him in the truck.
You're a good writer, Nick. I give this writing an A-plus.
I had better sex in prison.
Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work?
You do.
Do I get a country-western name?
Ten dollars? What do I do with ten dollars?
You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!?
Can't be attracting attention, right?
How 'bout the tree? You want the tree?
He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe.
THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE!
I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK! I CAN'T! GO BACK!
There's no snow in Vegas, 'kay? They don't know it, they don't want it, they got laws against the stuff. They got Egypt down there, right, they got Monte Carlo, Hawaii, they got ancient Rome, but where's the Winter Castle, right? Where's the Swiss miss Chalet? Where's the Big Fucking Igloo?
The Powwow Safe?
...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum...
What the hell was that about --
You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free --
THERE ARE MONSTERS IN THE GELATIN!
Why you gotta say a thing like that.
Just taste that Christmas turkey.
So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work.
Just a roach, Zook.
Rudy, don't move --
Don't move, Rudy!
GUARD! GUARD!
Do what?
Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by --
POP! That was My card!
I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up. I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything! You can torture me if you want -
How ya doin', Toothpick?
Jesus Christ, give me a fuckin' chance to breathe. I got a few questions of my own, ya know.
I'll call somebody.
I don't know what he did to her, but she got even.
I don't buy it. It doesn't make sense.
The motherfucker killed Vic.
Daddy, did ya see that?
Now Vic was tellin' me, he's got a parole problem.
I don't know, but somebody did.
Brown's dead, we don't know about Blue.
Would you stop it with that shit! You beat on this prick enough, he'll tell ya he started the Chicago fire. That don't necessarily make it so. Okay, first things fucking last, where's the shit? Please tell me somebody brought something with them.
No, it wasn't Pam Grier, Pam Grier was the other one. Pam Grier made the movies. Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show, without Pam Grier.
He's right about the ear, it's hacked off.
Say "hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?
Nice Guy. When we got to the bar...
The Boots and Socks in Gardena. When we got there, I met Joe and a guy named Mr. White. It's a phony name. My name's Mr. Orange.
No, he ain't familiar. He ain't one of Cabot's soldiers either. He's gotta be from outta town. But Joe knows him real well.
The way they talk to each other. You can tell they're buddies.
What kinds questions did Cabot ask?
What's this?
What?
What?
...Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in county unexpectedly.
Mr. Brown?
I'm sorry.
Who's your parole officer?
For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby... Toby... Toby... Toby Wong... Toby Wong... Toby Chung... fuckin' Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't-know-what, outta my left.
What's she doin' now?
Your name's Freddy something.
Joe, you want me to shoot him for you?
You gonna bark all day, little doggie, or are you gonna bite?
Why?
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why the fuck didn't you say that in the first place?
Because this guy's a fucking psycho. And if you think Joe's pissed at us, that ain't nothing compared to how pissed off I am at him, for puttin' me in the same room as this bastard.
Hey, bless your heart for what you're trying to do. I was panicking for a moment, but I've got my senses back now. The situation is, I'm shot in the belly. And without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
Fuck jail! I don't give a shit about jail. But I can't die. You don't have to take me in. Just drive me up to the front, drop me on the sidewalk. I'll take care of myself. I won't tell them anything. I swear to fucking god, I won't tell 'em anything. Look in my eyes, look right in my eyes.  I-won't-tell-them-anything. You'll be safe.
I haven't had a chance to think. First I was just trying to get the fuck outta there. And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
What's wrong with it?
No real people?
I don't wanna kill anybody. But if I gotta get out that door, and you're standing in my way, one way of the other, you're gettin' outta my way.
Yeah, and that was a fucking miracle. But if they did get away, where the fuck are they?
No, they're not in the car. No, I don't have them on me. Ya wanna go with me and get 'em? Yes, we can go right now. But first listen to what I'm telling you. We were fuckin' set up! Somebody is in league with the cops. We got a Judas in our midst. And I'm thinkin' we should have our fuckin' heads examined for waiting around here.
No shit?
Now you're using your head. For all we know, he's the rat.
I gotta take a squirt, where's the commode in this dungeon?
So what do you suggest, we go to a hotel? We got a guy who's shot in the belly, he can't walk, he bleeds like a stuck pig, and when he's awake, he screams in pain.
We had just gotten away from the cops. He just got shot. It was my fuckin' fault he got shot. He's a fuckin' bloody mess - he's screaming. I swear to god, I thought we was gonna die right then and there. I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry, he's gonna be okay, I'm gonna take care of him. And he asked me what my name was. I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms. What the fuck was I supposed to tell him, "Sorry, I can't give out that information, it's against the rules. I don't trust you enough."? Maybe I shoulda, but I couldn't.
Who cares what your name is? Who cares if you're Mr. Pink, Mr. Purple, Mr. Pussy, Mr. Piss...
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
You don't know how good it is to see you.
Yes, ma'am.
So am I.
But you eat, don't you?
Where do you keep the can opener?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
But the rest is right.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
All my clothes --
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
What was he in jail for?
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
Can I have my gun back?
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
What did you come back for?
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
Yeah, how did you know?
I can't take her with me.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
Helen -- why don't you and Mary go on with Clay?
But I want to stay.
Stop it -- stop it.
That sure smells good.
Up here in the hills, a man gets a hankering to smell powder.
I saw your fire and dropped by to say hello.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
Goodbye and thanks.
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
Maybe I could start you out.
Gee, I can't.
What comes after Z?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
What do they look like?
How about California?
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
Oh, he was a widower. Why didn't you say that?...  Don't worry, sweetie, I can whip up a new batch in a flash.
That's it.
Oh... I guess I'll die now.
We already know each other. Hey, Brenda.
Ouch!!
Hello Brenda.
Where's Shorty?
Hey, you left your book back there.
So it looks like we're going to be spending the weekend together.
Whoa, check this out. She looks like you.
Oh yeah... another difference is she looks more sophisticated and classy. More feminine. And her tits are perfect. Not pointy and funny looking, or spaced too far apart...
Well, if that's Hanson, then who's the guy with the hand?
Hey, wanna' share a soda?
What should we get?
I'm sorry, I should have been watching where I...
Oh, right.
Come in somebody. Can you hear me?
Oh my God! I'm here with the...
Ummm!! They smell delicious.
Would you like me to help you pass them back?
Yes, we made it!
Me and my friends... You see there was this ghost. He came out of nowhere and....
I'm sorry.
That was a great idea, Shorty.
I don't like this, this...
I'll make it part of the class. We'll tell them they're participating in a study on sleep disorders.
We record and document it. We're gonna make history, Dwight. The first documented, unrefuted evidence of life after death. The book sales alone will be worth millions. I'll be rich, and you my friend, will have one hell of a thesis paper. Now, what time is orientation?
Would you please focus?
So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
I don't think so. It's on all the cameras, and check this out. The thermal readings inside the house dropped ten degrees when the image was recorded.
Work, work, work. Is that all that you do?
You know, Dwight, I hear you're the only one who has the key to the gate.
What if I wanted to borrow those keys?
She's right. We should stick together.
Who's first? Anyone like a wing?
You never could feel your legs.
You're not wearing a belt.
Uh... I'm Father McFeely
Father, I think you should rest.
This part removes the sense of humor.
Sweet. Hey, you got a tattoo, too.
Oh, boy! 
0h, shit!
 I'm not kidding. Carl stood me up this morning and then he was murdered at the flea market....
Just a little, please. Bad for the teeth.
You'd probably date him!  He's cu-uuute! Hey, Dad, did you ever see "Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer?"
Chip, honey?
Ladies and gentlemen, the perfect meatloaf!
I'm happy too and we want you to be happy.
In here, Mom...
That's cool... hey look, you're Carl's brother, right?
TV, man! Farrah Fawcett's interested in playing my mother!
He goes to college with me!
Nothing like a home cooked meal, honey.
Beverly! Not the Sterners!
Beverly, I've been reading all about it... is it menopause?
Did you drive your car to the PTA meeting yesterday, Mrs. Sutphin?
Did you recognize the voice of the caller?
Hello.
Goddamn you! STOP CALLING HERE!
Just a half-a-cup.  Hello, Dottie. I'm so sorry to hear of your troubles...
And we're going right to the flea market to get another one! Misty tells me there's a whole booth of Franklin Mint stuff. Dottie, you lock up.  I'll take care of poor Rosemary!
Were you in the men's room at the Edmonson Drive In Flea Market on Saturday, September 19th?
0h, that's horrible, honey.  I sold the Pee-Wee Herman doll!!
Beverly, are you alright?
Beverly, honey, you've got some...  ...do-do on your shoe.
Mrs. Ackerman, when you left me at the flea-market, where did you go?
Mrs... Sutphin?
Chip is off to a fine start this year.  Focused... conscientious... participates actively in classroom discussion.
He is assistant manager of a video shop...
No, he did not! We are a loving supportive family, Mr. Stubbins.
I don't know what it is about today, but I FEEL GREAT!
Man, that one made me puke!
Look, sister', Manhattan is only nine miles long and four and one half miles wide. I ain't never been off it. I know it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer --say fifty bucks, and I'll get your sister for you. I guarantee
Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles. You've got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?
That's what I tried to find out.	I went to La Jeunesse ——  -- used a phony health inspector's badge —— they let me go through the works -- all but one room. That room was locked. I'd like to see the inside of that room.
Sister, you can't just go breaking into places. There's a night watchman down there and locks on the door.
I don't like this.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
The acceptance of a secret is an obligation and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don't you?
Then, you also understand that you must die.
When I wanted to.
I read your book. The one in which you wrote about the cure for drinking.
I'll give you a check.
Tell me, how is Jacqueline?
But tell me --
How's Miss Jacqueline?
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
Redi's all right.
And that was all?
You can't make it your life's work looking for Jacqueline.  ) You'll have to do other things... live...get some enjoyment out of life. I hope you'll let me help you.
I'm sorry. I didn't intend to treat you like a child.
The people at the restaurant?
 What have you done about Irving August?
Good night, Jacqueline -- good night, Mary.
I'm going to find your sister.
All very nice but, what are you going to do - listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline's voice?
He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want —- surrender herself to the police —— stand trial —— I don't think he knows.
She'll have to know some time.
Who are you?
And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die -- always.
I'm tired of being afraid -— of waiting.
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
Look. I'm serious. It's a real and vary earnest society -- a dangerous society...
It isn't that -- you said, "have to go." What could compel you --
You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something -- what was it?
Not I —- I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,  Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano -— "My courage like a white plume" — and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,
Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn't be doing this, you know. It's against the rules.  When did you say you wanted them?
Where is Jacqueline Gibson?
What was she to you?
Tell me where Jacqueline is -— we've got to find her.
Yes. When I tell you.
I'm afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my friend. What was in your mind?
What?
Don't be so amazed. It's a very ordinary matter. I'm Jacqueline's physician... Mr. Ward told me you were in town and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.
I'd hardly describe It that way —- The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I'll be out in a minute.
That makes it all the more difficult ——
We don't know, Mary. We've been unable to get in touch with your sister.
I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi. She vouchsafes no information whatsoever.  It is six months since your tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay on here as a paying pupil.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di vedere che cosa c'era in quella stanza.
Is it fifteen minutes yet?
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
I went back through the history last night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz -- I read what he wrote --
It is a very real danger and one which forces our decision.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Oh, uh-huh.
No, I think you look... fine.
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
...free-lance. You know.
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Do I pay taxes? Of course I pay taxes, only a liar doesn't pay taxes, I'm not a liar. A liar is the second lowest form of human being.
Why is that?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
Aren't you?
Hi!
It's a personal project I'm working on.
And they just answer them?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
Yes. But I sense the element of revenge here.
Is he going to see this?
No.
About me?
Why not?
That's correct.
Yes.
The problem was me. I was... I was a pathological liar. Or am, I should say. Lying is like alcoholism, one is always "recovering".
Ann, it could happen to me all over again, don't you see? I could start to --
You mean you're still in contact with her?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Don't do that.
Because.
Why are you ashamed?
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
That's the first thing that ran through my mind when I saw you. I thought this is not the same man that rode the unicycle naked through the homecoming parade.
Something wrong?
There's nothing to know, Ann.
For God's sake, Ann, I am not fucking your sister. I don't find her that attractive, for one.
Look, this conversation is utterly ridiculous. Maybe when you have some evidence, we should talk, but don't give me conjecture and intuition.
Goddam right. I mean, can you imagine: "Your honor, I'm positive this man is guilty. I can't place him at the scene or establish a motive, but I have this really strong feeling."
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
Jesus Christ! What the hell happened? I came home and your car was gone, the door was open, I thought for sure you'd been abducted by some mad fucker, I was literally just calling the cops when you walked in. What happened?
Bastard...
But he asked you to quit your job, and you do have housework.
Prior to this feeling, were you comfortable having physical contact with him?
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
No, he left last week.
I'm glad you feel that way, because I feel that way, too.
What are you talking about?
I just thought it might --
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
He just asked me questions.
I wanted him to see me.
You couldn't do it, period.
I feel like I do.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
And you ask questions, right?
What about when you touched it? What did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?
What did he say?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Do you think I'm pretty?
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Ouch. Okay, I deserved that. Cynthia, don't you understand? After the first time it's just not spontaneous. There's no edge anymore. Look at the tapes, there is only one date on each label. I have never taped anyone twice.
I'm sorry. I can't do it.
I can't let my lunch hour go on too long. I've already skipped one meeting.
I have a friend coming in from out of town, I'll probably be spending some time with him the next couple of days.
John?
Not today. I've got other plans.
John Millaney.
Hello.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
It won't. I trust him.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
Plus first and last month deposit.
I'm sorry. Am I prying again?
Especially if you want to leave someplace in a hurry.
Graham, I swear to Christ I'll kill your scrawny ass. Now give me those tapes.
Answer him, goddammit!!
May I ask who's calling?
Mr. Millaney?
...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
No thanks. Just wanted to tell you that Dr. St. Luc is coming up to see Nick at ten or so.
C'mon, let's smoke one of the cigarettes right now. Your father'll never miss it.
Roger? If you're going to be staying here anyway, why don't you come up to my place for a late supper?
Well? Supper at my place?
You say something?
Make love to me, make love to me, love, love to me...
Want me to breathe deeply?
Good shape for an old man, eh?
You want to help sick people for the rest of your life? God forbid I should talk you out of it.
OK, I bite. What does it look like?
Maybe Hobbes didn't know it, but Annabelle was a pretty popular girl around Starliner Towers. I've got three men here, maybe four, who're hosting large, free-moving, apparently pathogenic, abdominal growths that nobody I've tried can identify. You were next on my list.
I've got a date with one of them at ten. Can you make it?
BREAKING OUT
Later, Brenda.  Ah, Bert, could you spare a moment?
Is it because I'm becoming too popular?
How did you come by this scenario?
In a way...
McKinley?...McKinley?
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR ENSLAVEMENT
I'll leave you young things to it.
Oh, Oliver.  What are we going to do?
YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEART
SOME PEOPLE DO IT FOR FOR ENJOYMENT
What are you talking about? Danny Slepstrini is a chip off the old block.  I played 18 holes of golf with his father just last week.  And Hank says Danny's moved to New York.  To better himself.
Vance!  Vance Parker.
I NEED SOME
Brad!
BRAD!
Let's hear the five 'F's' for today.  F for...
F for...
Our speciality.
That's an extremely negative response.
THIS COULD BE THE START OF A WHOLE NEW CAREER HERE
And none of them worked?
And we also know how you feel, we're not strangers to confusion.
Nice technique there...  ...Cammi.
You picked him up and you fucked him, didn't you, bitch?
The fuck was that?
The problem with that is that then there's one extra --
Are you there? Miles?
I'm sorry, Miles. We did all we could. You've been a real trooper.  Tell him I'll call back.
My condolences.
What do you think?
Busy night for a Tuesday. We had a busload of retired folks in on a wine tour. Usually they're not too rowdy, but tonight there was something going on. Full moon or something. What can I get you?
They're from both of us.
And what was that other one you did, the one where you're the jogger?
Spray and Wash. That's the one.
She was good for you.  And so beautiful and intelligent. You knew her, right?
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Hi.
I can explain.
Highliner, please.
Are you a writer too?
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
Shut up.  Here's to a great week.
And?
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
This is rose, right?
What do you smell?
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
We should have driven.
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Have you no shame?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
We're on.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Pull yourself together, man.
Where were you?
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
Oh, boy.
What the fuck are you doing?
Does she know about Saturday?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Huh.
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
What?
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
She tell you she was married?
So what's the plan?
Come on, let me drive.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Oh yeah? How is it?
I'm having the salmon.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
So what's your novel about?
What's the title?
Yeah? Like what?
Bathroom over there?
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
Were you ever going to say anything?
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
Hi, Vicki.  You look beautiful.
That's great.
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Oh. Huh. Well...  Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
How much skin and stem contact?
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
So what do you think?
Huh.
Oops. Sorry.
Hi, guys. We should probably get going.
See you, Miles. You take care.
What's wrong with the water next to your bed?
Not English though. You heard the voices right Uncle Merrill?
Listen Bo. This is very important. Everything people have written about in science books is going to change. The history of the world's future is on the TV right now. We need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you were there...  For your children Bo.
I'm scared.
And tell Merrill to swing away.
Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He's messed with our property, he's coming around the house. It's time for an ass whoopin'!
It's noise.
How can you say that?
For the kids protection. All they were doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or tea party or something right?
Chicken Teriyaki.
Should we turn off the lights?
They're distracting us?
He's been like that for awhile. We need to get him some medicine.
He's not strong enough to fight off another attack.
Don't touch him.
Can I use Bo's old baby monitor as a walkie-talkie?
These are D's; I need double A's.
I can't even imagine.
It's the strangest thing Father.
You said something was strange. What's strange?
What about them?
Okay.  So he was tall?
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
I don't think so.
Is he okay?
She's not in an ambulance Father.
Don't do it!
The book says they're probably very good problem solvers.
Forget the money. You've got to get these people out of here. This is no place to be sitting with women and kids.
Emmett.
This was my father's. The men who killed him took it.
I'm surprised to see you out here tonight.
Goodbye?
You don't make it easy on a fellow.
Are you all right?
We told Sheriff Cobb about the attack.  He said he'd... look into it.  I can't believe he's the law out here. Now I see why you all wear guns.
This time you're really going?  You know where I'll be.
Jefferson City?
I've never been in there. They just jumped you out of the blue?
Looks like those boys are headed south, so they weren't the same ones that jumped me. Which way you going?
Doesn't look quite fair.
You'll have to deal me out on that. I've had some experience with that sort of thing, and I don't want any more.
Then I guess this is where we part ways. Sorry.
You might make a farmer yet.
Where is Rae?
Who?
What about the law?
He acted bravely out there, Hannah. Just bad luck his getting hit. Could have been any one of us.
Never will again.
It was not -- it was Murdo's. Those McKendricks don't know how to act like human beings.
Didn't he tell you about Blind Pete?
You can't do this.
There are three strangers in this room, traveller, and these gents you are accusing aren't them.  Are these your friends?
Hello, Rae.
I'm not sure, but I got an idea. And when I am sure, they're going to pay.
What are you doing here, Rae? This ain't for you.
Why come to me?
What's stopping you?
Yeah, it's working out real good.
Things are getting messy around here.  I hear Ezra Johnson got himself killed.
I've given that up.
This is mighty sweet, Paden. I think I finally found my place in the world.
What is it you want from me?
I'm a great believer in doing nothing.
I'm going to have to look into this.
You gotta calm down, Paden. Everything will be put straight in a few days.
What a waste. This could have been such a sweet deal for us.
Stella... Are you the midnight star herself?
It's the only place I'm happy.
That's Kelly, my so-called partner. He runs that side.
Yeah, aside from being a loud-mouthed, lying cheat, he's just the man I would have picked.
I don't own this place. The man who does stuck me with Kelly.
But not everyone's imaginary, are they, Mr. Taransky?  I refer, of course, to Edith.
We all know what happened.  In a fit of jealous rage you killed Simone and dumped her body off a boat she bought for you.
I'd love to stop somewhere but I'm late.  I'm on my way to see Viktor now.
Exactly.  You're a household name now.  You're moving in entirely different worlds.  That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
It's the truth.  Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy.  We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal.  You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey.  I called what's his name at Warner's.  He said he'd take a meeting -- in July.  I've fought for you Viktor...  You want to talk severance?
They're yours.  But how are you going to finish it?  Without a star there's no movie.
I can't wait to meet her.
Viktor, it's my studio.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Whatever.  I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
Hair and make-up?
She was in the theater?  When? Where?
There isn't one.
Experience, Viktor.  I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them.  I'm worried about you, that's all.  This woman -- she controls your destiny.
I got them to remove the reflection.  The mirror's metaphor -- to show how her character's inwardly dead.
Yes.  To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
I'll tell you what.  I know how much this means to you.  I'll try to get her to plug the film.  I'm not promising anything but maybe she'll do a talk show -- taped.
She was there.  She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
My two favorite girls.
... Simone.
As a matter-of-fact I am.
I just read somewhere --
This is crazy.  Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone.  What woman can?
Of course she will.  Her public will demand it.
I'm going to tell you a secret now, Elaine.  Simone is not a real person.  I invented her.
Can I see you later -- go away for the weekend?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Don't look so glum, Viktor.  It's not a death sentence.
Where are you?
Mom, do you miss Dad?
Let's go, Lainey.  There's nothing here.
You had no choice, Elaine.  He's a liability.
You're with me to be close to her?
Well, no one could accuse you of being over-exposed, Simone.  Why have you stayed so completely out of the limelight?
And still the connection was undeniable.  I haven't read "Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant.  And I know I would be perfect for Clive.
You'll never guess who I'm with... you ran into him on the lot.
-- No.  No.  A real wall.  You ran right through it.
You know I sometimes forget she has bodily functions.
-- We call them "vactors".
Not quite how I imagined it --
She's a miracle, Dad.  Where did you find her?
Okay, Dad.
Good-night, Daddy.
Hey, Lainey.  How's your love life?
Too impersonal.  They have to meet face-to-face.
-- Plead guilty and throw yourself on the mercy of the court.  It's the best deal you're going to get.
Nice try.  If we can't get to her through you, maybe your family will be more co-operative.  I can guarantee you, Taransky, one way or another, Miss Simone and I are going to get acquainted.
I know what you're up to.
I've done my homework.  I've studied her.
I know that's what you'd like us to believe.  But I got to tell you -- embezzlement is a serious matter. Not to mention abduction.
You love her, don't you, Max?
Taransky isn't that good an actor. No, they're taking special precautions.  Some kind of new encryption.
Well, we got some of Taransky's fingerprints, a lot of your fingerprints... but none of hers.
Mr. Sayer...
Mr. Sayer, did we pay the million bucks yet?
-- I've been here before! -- On my honeymoon with my ex-wife.
A lot's happened since we last saw each other.
Good morning, Simone.
Maybe he can.
The only real truth is in the work.
You're going to get in a lot of trouble, Mr. Taransky.
Mahogany. I'd say that cost at least a couple hundred. Maybe three.
Are you calling me?
Why, Malcolm?
All your soldiers speak Latin?
I got an award once. From the Mayor.
Know what?
What kind of words?
I didn't know you were funny.
Once upon a time there was a prince, who was being driven around... He drove around for a long, long time... Driving and driving... It was a long trip... He fell asleep...  When he woke up, they were still driving... The long drive went on--
Yes.
No.
Dead people, like in graves and coffins?
How often do you see them?
...No.
Yes?
Can I ask you then?
What do you want more than anything?
I told you what I want.
--What?
Don't cry.
Dr. Crowe?
Are you wigging out?
We're not gonna start crying again, are we?
I believe both of you now.  And I think I might know how to make them go away.
You know that accident up there?
Dead people?
You see ghosts, Cole?
What are you thinking, Momma?
Cole, this was a legal courthouse. Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.
Excuse me?
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley!
Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!
'Course, some folks say 'ol Jethro shouldn't have been buried up here... with the rest of the Macdonalds.
'Course, it's none of my business.
You ever hear of... the harvest of blood?
I'd watch your step if I were you, son.
See?
Fuck you.
Bitch.
Come on --
Sounds familiar.
Wait a second. Did you say "patricide?"
You're out of your mind, man.
The ancient Aztecs knew how powerful this stuff was.
So... what does it do?
Should we be doing this, dude?
What are you going to do? Shoot me?
I'm your son. And Laureen's son.
I came back for the funeral. That's all.
That old barn. After the fire... I rebuilt it nail by nail. Just the way your granddaddy would've wanted it.
Old slave superstition. You sprinkle a little blood mixed with water on the crops, you get yourself a good harvest... So they say.
Jesus. What a bunch of useless zombies.
Yeah. Maybe I can pick a little cotton for da masta.
You seen Mac? His bed hasn't been slept in.
You never told us you grew up on a farm.
Suzie --
You're... limping.
Suzie... No.
No Mac, please... I --
The trap door. That's how he escaped the fire...
...no... Mac... p-please...
It gets worse. He's cut all the phone lines.
Was always curious why you... married Grant in the first place... Just never seemed outta love.
Grant used to get filled up every day. I knew it was just to see me. He was too old -- But he was handsome. And he had that big ol' Lincoln then. I flirted with him.
After all this shit tonight, I know for sure now you regret not running off with me to Hollywood!
What are you doing?!
Please, Starla. I'm gonna do my best not to hurt anybody --
What?
Rorschach.
Oh, shit! I hope she ain't a police radio aficionado. If so, I apolog
It's just a work thing.
Grant, no -- I'm sorry, I'm just -- I'm not in the mood. Grant is on top of her, breathing a little too heavy. GRANT Come on, baby, it's --
Why'd you betray me, sugarplum?!
Now he's here. He went in Mr. Grant.
When one sees you they all see you.
Maybe you better sit back down. You don't look so good.
You.
Get your hands off my daughter!
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
Well?...
Driving, talking to me...
Seriously?!?
Anything?
You know, you're not a bad driver.
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
What the hell are you doing?!?
Yeah.
Mississippi's the other way!
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
An unmarked police car.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
I'm proud of you.
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Why are you stopping?
See ya, Bandit.
Why should I?
But you'll do it?
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per.  Forget it.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
What are you doin' now?
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
Loud and clear.
Let's get the hell outta here.
You can't swear on these.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
Just fine. What's the weather like?
You're coming up to the scale house.
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
Bandit, I just thought I'd lay a Smokey report on you.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Five thou.
-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
But with these down, doesn't that pose a major security concern if, as you say, you have to keep an eye on everything at all times?
Is your security team armed?
Anything on the Swede?
Maybe he's that good. Never been caught, no criminal record.
But the Bureau knew Sparazza killed Heller. Why not go after him, guns blazing' for that one?
Did the Justice lawyers sign off?
What about the sheriff's task force?
Did he give you his name?
-- run both those names through the D.C. database. Call San Francisco, see if they've got anybody in the field doing collateral inquiries for --
Who?
I did. We -- yeah, I know.
Are you on a land line?
Two security levels, the one we're going in under the guise of, hotel security, has restricted access. They're mostly there to monitor the lobby, handle disturbances on the different floors and toss out drunks.  There's a thirty-five member employee rotation going from graveyard to day shift. If we split up, we can blend in and enter unnoticed. Once we're inside the hotel, we'll regroup.
D'you talk to'm?
What'd you say?
I said that we were returning his call and you were real concerned, because he sounded real concerned.
FUCK YOU!
And I vibe that kiddo, I do indeed, but it's one'a those fait accompli things, you have to --
Sparazza is rumored to have performed in excess of one-hundred and thirty contract murders, including one of the bureau's most celebrated agents. Freeman Heller. You heard of "The Turnpike Murders" that was Sparazza.
On an extradition flight back to El Salvador, he murdered a security detachment and vanished.
My debrief --
You're finished.
Sparazza was in failing health and looking for a donor. The son who had betrayed and burned him so thoroughly seemed a obvious choice.
...When did you know all this?
You got clicks, anything?
-- yeah, now lemme finish, I was eavesdroppin', so give me sec, lay this thing out, since the information might be a little loose --
Y'gotta, y'gotta. But d'ya think they'll kick ransom for that little prick, assuming we get to'm.
Wow.
Shoot.
Well, I'm hearin' the Swede's been dispatched, he's flying so --
That takes some of the sting out.
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
What I'm saying is: Don't trust anyone.  Find yourself a weapon of some sort.
You'll end up like me.
You have to give me your word you won't come in.  Then I'll come out.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation.  Now: What happened to him?
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
How much sleep do you need?
I told you, try to stay calm.  You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean?  I don't think so.
Stop equivocating!  Unbelievable, how you equivocate!  You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen!  This is happening, Kelvin.  Wake up.
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right?  Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate.  You don't believe me?  Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it.  I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
What's wrong with you?  We need your help.
Don't.
We're taking a flight?
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
He has a point.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
What do I have to do to stop it?
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Is that really what you want?
Last night.  You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Hi.
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
What did he say?
Would you pick one out, please?
Put it on my account, please.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
What about Neil?
You asked.
You put me life in danger.
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
Stop, will you?!
I do care about you!
Yeah.
Where?
Oh yeah.  When is it?  This thing in Queens.
What a memory.
Do you?
They guys treatin' you all right?
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
You still going away?
Hello, Claire.  How extraordinary that you came.
Keep what handy?
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own.  We can afford it now.
For how long?
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi...  ... crummy.  I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
Hey.  The neighbors.
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
Honey.  You got him.
She's got to identify him.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
What did she say the down payment was?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Mike, take it easy...
What did you watch?
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
Ellie...
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
But I got him!  He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
What about when she identifies him?!
Let's go.  We're takin' her home!  Move it!  Get the cars!
Who's Joey Venza?
No, I will not step outside.
You made a terrible mistake, Keegan. You didn't do what I said.
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Sexual tension...
Ah, ya know.  Neighborhood's not what it used to be.  Kid no more'n five swiped a candy bar the other day.
Cause if you get in a bind--
Yeah, ya like to do things on your own  I been thinkin' lately.  Maybe I wasn't the, ya know, greatest dad--
Lizzy!
You maniac.  You'll blow your scholarship.
Oh, I need your notes from the classes I missed.
How are you doing, kid?
You can be great, kid, just stick with it. But let me give you one little piece of advice... be a good guy.
Relax, Jameson.  This is business. I know you want photos of me, so I'll give your boy Parker an exclusive.  On one condition--
Is that bug juice, or are you just glad to see me?
I see.  So, Amazing Spider-Man-- I'll assume that's not your given name--
I'll hate myself in the morning for asking, but what exactly makes you any more amazing than the average jerk on the street?
He left.  I couldn't believe it-- he just left!  It's as if he's somewhere else... I'm only getting a piece of him.
I hate--
No.  I was lying about the coffee.
Well, no.
You'd feel what?
Hello, Liz.
Octavius wasn't the murderer type.
Aunt May, you're trespassing.
It's Friday night...
The record--
I was napping on the couch.  There was a voice and a shot.  I woke up. Ben was looking at me.
A bit melodramatic… but if you could prove it… that would tie in your unified field theory, the Big Bang, Kaluza-Klein--
Life and death matter. Yours-- everyone's.  By comparison, our search for truth is only a product of curiosity, a game--
Your dog ate it.
This photo you took of "Spider-Man" -
The paper, my boy.  A solid B-plus.
Kid, you were terrific.  Max Reiss, novelty acts.  Was that judo or something?  Ah, skip it.  Question is, can you do it again?
I sent for  the police.  We can explain.
You're sure you're all right.
Logic.  Lot 49 is the closest stockpile of SL 270--  I do feel foolish talking with a man dressed like a--
Loonytunes.  And yet...
Professor, you ever fly one of these things before?
Jawohl.
Maybe just a hint or so. Think hard.
W-w-will that do or do you want some m-m-m --?
I understand how you feel, Cookie. It's sort of rough -- one American squealing on other Americans. Then again, Cookie -- maybe that stoolie's not an American at all. Maybe he's a German the Krauts planted in this barracks. They do this type of thing. Just put an agent in with us -- a trained specialist. Lots of loose information floating around a prison camp. Not just whether somebody wants to escape, but what outfits we were with and where we were stationed, and how our radar operates. Could be, couldn't it?
Hold it, Sefton. So we heard some shots -- so who says they didn't get away?
You would, would you? Listen, Stupe -- the first week I was in this joint somebody stole my Red Cross package, my blanket and my left shoe. Well, I wised up since. This ain't no Salvation Army -- this is everybody for himself. Dog eat dog.
Static is right! The radio's static, Patton's static, we're static!
I suppose they also know about your distillery and the horseraces?
Yeah, what about it?  Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
Put me down for ten, you louse.
How did he get over there?
The S.S. Men are here to pick up Dunbar. They're taking him to Berlin. Looks like he's finished.
You killed them, huh? Both of them?
Maybe he would. We applied for Officers' Training together, remember? They turned me down, but I'm glad to see you made it. Of course, it couldn't be that all that dough behind you had something to do with it!  His mother's got twenty million dollars.
I am Lieutenant Dunbar.
105-353.
Ever try forty sleeping pills?
There will be two S.S. men here tomorrow to take you to Berlin. You will be interrogated by the General Staff. When you come to the part about your arrest, I'm sure you won't forget to give me the proper credit.
As for the blankets, you will notice they are very warm. Fifty percent wool.
And the way you search your prisoners, it does sound rather unlikely.
Jawohl!
Hey, Schulz! I got a deal for you. Suppose you help us escape. We'll go home and have everything ready for you in Madison Square Garden. For the world championship! Schulz, the Beast of Bavaria versus Halitosis Jones!
How? We go to California. I got a cousin that's working for the Los Angeles Gas Company. That's how we get the address, see? Isn't that clever? I take you up to her house and ring the doorbell and say, 'Congratulations, Miss Grable. We have voted you the girl we'd most like to be behind barbed wire with, and I'm here to present the award'.
Harry -- I'm blind!
What do those broads say?
Let me do it, Hoffy.
...a Lieutenant James Dunbar?
Look -- if you don't like the way I'm handling this job --
I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
No volunteers, Price. I said we're all in on it.
Why the south latrine?
Los, los. Dummkopf!
We know! We got them last year. Five minutes after the Geneva Man was gone, the blankets were gone.
Stay out of it, Sefton.
If you can't get the BBC, how about getting Guy Lombardo?
What's the big idea, Sefton? Take that telescope out of here.
Hurry up on that trap.  What are you trying to do, Sefton? Gum up the works?
How do they know?
You off your rocker?
Now you've done it. You've given me nervous indigestion.  Anything else bothering you, boys?
No. I don't sprechen sie deutsch.
December seventh, forty-one.
Let us see. We have now two empty bunks here.  Nummer einundsiebzig und Nummer dreiundsiebzig in Baracke vier.
Nun? Was ist? Haben Sie's herausgefunden?
You should go and see the doctor. Maybe I can --  Silk stockings?
You'd better talk, Schulz, because I'm going to find out with you or without you. Because I won't let go for a second. Because they'll have to kill me to stop me. So talk!
What's the matter with you? You want to be killed?
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning the Geneva Man is coming to inspect the camp whether we are living up to the International Convention. I am sure he will find we are treating you very well. You must not run around in your underwear. And take off the wash. The Kommandant wants all the barracks to be spic and also span.
So you're stuck with me, eh?
I thought he was the Chief Engineer.
Guinan said Soran was trying to get back to the ribbon. If that's true, then there must be some connection with the Amargosa star.
Data, are you all right?
No. And what you must try to avoid is becoming consumed by another emotion which I believe you're beginning to experience: guilt.
Courage is an emotion too, Data.  Now, can you project the course of the ribbon?
Now, you said the gravitational forces in this sector have been altered, could that also affect the course of the ribbon?
I get it. I get it.
Sensors show five life signs aboard the station, Captain.
We all are, Data. But we're going to get him back.
I have rerouted auxiliary power to the lateral thrusters- attempting to level our descent.
Where is he now?
Can I?
Beautiful day, isn't it?
This clock, I gave this clock to Bones.
So you're telling me this is the 24th-century, and I'm dead?
No, no, it's not. It's better.
Yes.  Thank you.
I'm not going  Scotty, help me with this chute.
You know, Scotty, it amazes me.
Let's try to move beyond the usual prisoner-interrogator banter, shall we? You have information and I need it.  Did the Captain explain his orders to you? Did he say why you were searching for trilithium?
I just stopped your heart for five seconds. It felt like an eternity, didn't it? Did you know that you can stop the human heart for up to ten minutes before the onset of brain damage?
Is there a problem?
There is something else, Captain. One of the scientists, a Doctor Soran,has insisted on speaking with you.  I told him you were busy, sir, but he said it was absolutely imperative that he speak with you right away.
Report.
Captain, are you all right?
Captain, Im sorry.  I know there were a lot of unresolved conflicts between you and your brother.
Or perhaps they're on the surface.
An experimental compound the Romulans have been working on. In theory, a trilithium-based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti-matter weapon. But they never found a way to stabilize it.
I have spoken to the Klingon High Council, sir. They identified the Bird of Prey as belonging to the Duras sisters.
Tractor beam, aye!
Steady... Steady, boys. Keep scanning...  I thought you people were reliable... Where the hell is he!
Mr. Chekov, I ordered Spock's quarters sealed!
Will we get another ship?
Unit two, this is One. The Kobayashi Maru has set sail for the promised land. Acknowledge.
Excelsior closing to 4,000 meters, sir.
Response?
Nothing on my scanner, sir.
Could it be Spock's?
This is where the fun begins, Saavik!
Approximately two meters long... Cylindrical in form...
Did your collaborator know?
The Genesis wave started a life clock ticking for him and the planet. But at the rate things are going now...
Whoever they are, they're getting closer.
Captain, this is Saavik. Come in, please...
I'm sure Starfleet would approve, sir.
Steady... Steady... All right, Mr. Scott.
Admiral, this is Lieutenant Saavik.
The Katra ritual is meant to deposit Spock's consciousness in the Hall of Ancient Thought - not in his body.
Or less. What you describe is called Fal Tor Pan - the refusion. It is very dangerous. The elders may not choose to attempt it.
The word, sir?
Count on our help, sir.
Yes. Enough energy to hide a ship, wouldn't you say?
Mr. Sulu, you're on manual.
Standby automatic approach system ... Advise approach control.
How is Doctor McCoy, sir?
Why -- a natural desire to help finish the work we began!
Jim... You are my best officer and if I had a best friend, you'd be that too. But I am Commander, Starfleet, so I don't break rules!
You're right.  Thanks for the drink.
There are two more prisoners, Admiral. Do you want them killed too?  Surrender your vessel!
Maltz. Prisoners are at beam coordinates. Standby...
Give me what I want -- and I'll consider it...
Sir. Your son meant more to me than you can know. I'd have given my life if it would have saved his. You must believe me when I tell you that he made no request of me!
Bones!...
We are going to this "planet." Even as our emissaries negotiate for "peace" with the Federation, we will <U>act</U> for the preservation of our race! We will seize the secret of this weapon. The secret of ultimate power!
We are cloaked. Enemy closing on impulse power. Range, 5,000 Kellicams.
We still have the prisoners, sir. Perhaps their information --
You're not going in there -- !
Romulan Ale! Bones, you know this stuff is illegal --
Cheers. Bones, these are... charming.
Slide them down your nose. Now look at me over the top. And you read printed matter through the bottom.
Bull. You're hiding -- hiding behind the rules and regulations --
Don't mince words, Bones; tell me what you really think.
Shore leave, Admiral.
It never rains but when it pours --
They even killed the galley chief.
Lieutenant, you are looking at the only Starfleet cadet who ever beat the no-win scenario --
David was right, wasn't he? It's just to keep them busy.
How can you let them pull that stuff on you? They're just lazy.
David --
Don't tell me you've got something.
I told you! I told you I saw a --
<u>Botany Bay</u> -- oh no!
He left us.  We were no longer of use. SAAVIK Where is  the Reliant crew? Dead?
I would think so, sir. He's on the Fleet General Staff.
To Doctor Marcus, the civilian director of the experiments on Space Laboratory Regula I.
I'm Admiral Kirk...
Why didn't you tell me?
No sir! We have Genesis -- Whatever you want --
An emergency situation has arisen. By order of Starfleet Command, as of now, 1800 hours, I am assuming command of this vessel. Duty officer so note in the ship's log. Plot a new course: for Space Laboratory Regula I.  Mr. Scott?
Mr. Scott on discrete.
Midshipman, you're a tiger.
Admiral, I've got to take the mains off the line. The energizer's shaken loose and I can't get in there to fix her -- radiation --
Yes, Spock.
Spock, this is Kirk. It's two hours. Are you about ready?
Permission to come aboard, Captain?
Something may be wrong at Regula I. We've been ordered to investigate.
That won't be necessary: just take me to Regula I.
But it may be nothing; garbled communications. Why don't you...
Will you accompany me to the bridge?
It literally is Genesis...
What's she doing here?
Is it possible their COMM system has failed -- ?
Their coil emissions are normal... Wait: their shields are going up. They're locking phasers -- !
Not enough against their shields.
The prefix code?
A distinct possibility.
In my quarters, Uhura.
Uhura! What's happening? Damn it...
I failed to resolve the situation.
May I ask how <u>you</u> dealt with the test?
Indeterminate life signs.
Admiral?
How?
Hold your course. Look sharp...
Saavik, get us out, best speed!
I'll be in my quarters if needed, but I would prefer...
Yes, well, why don't you show him around and...
I really must thank you.
Course plotted for Regula I, Admiral...
Approaching Regula and Space Lab Regula I.
Admiral on the bridge --
We're over our heads. Mr. Sulu, get us out of here.
Fire all phasers...!
He's not what I expected, Sir.
All moorings are clear, Captain.
Sir, may I quote General Order 12: 'On the approach of any vessel, when communications have not been est --
Certainly...
I do this because I was there,
I would accept that as an axiom.
Don't tell me fish stories, kiddo. I've known you too long.
Professor Scott, I'm Dr. Nichols, plant manager. I'm terribly sorry but there's been an awful mix-up Would you believe I was never told about your visit?
Sure, slingshot around the Sun. If you pick up enough speed you're in time warp. If you don't, you fry..
It doesn't look all that different.
He's coming 'round, Jim...
Spock, it's me, Bones! I mean our experience was unique. You really have gone where no man has gone before. Can't you tell me what it felt like?
You mean I have to die to discuss your insights on death?
There are millions of other species on Earth, Doctor. Only human arrogance would assume the message was meant for man.
Specifically, Humpback Whales.
Well, you're gonna have to take your best shot.
... I don't think he understands...
What the hell do you think you're doing?
What's your degree in, dentistry?
Fundoscopic examination --
A simple evacuation of the expanding epidural hematoma will relieve the pressure.
What's causing that!?
... It gives me a great sense of history.
My name?
Status report, Admiral!
Attempting the hell to communicate.
Are you sure it isn't time for a colorful metaphor?
You mean man...
Well, for one thing, we simply don't have the money to keep feeding them a couple of tons of shrimp a day!
We don't want to be any trouble.
Then --
Or believe, I'll bet.
So how did a nice girl like you get to be a cetacean biologist?
What's that?
Wanna try it from the top?
Well, "Admiral," that may be the strangest dinner of my life and the biggest cockamamie fish story I've ever heard.
Here... In the park?
It's true... what you said...
Steady, now. We need your help.
You can't. Our next stop is the 23rd Century.
Hey! -- Where you going?!
Well, I... As they say in your century -- I don't even have your phone number. How will I find you?
Spock, could the Humpback's answer to this call be simulated?
But we can't turn away! Is there no alternative?
Not with this equipment. I have had to program some of the variables from memory.
I think we'll find what we're looking for at the Cetacean Institute in Sausalito. Two Humpbacks called George and Gracie.
Come on, fellah -- speak up!
You've done it before. Can't you remember?
Mr. Spock, where the hell is the power you promised me?
Can we make breakaway speed!?
Spock: Condition report!
Warp Nine... Nine point two... Nine point three...
10 seconds, sir!
I have no control, sir!
What is it?
Individual whale song getting stronger... This is strange, Admiral. The song is directly ahead. It's coming from San Francisco.
Admiral, I have a signal closing on the whales. Bearing 328 degrees.
Mr. Scott, how soon can we get underway?
Scotty, how long is this bay?
That should be enough. Can you enclose it to hold water?
It's going slow, sir. It'll be well into tomorrow.
The whales...?!
Excelsior? Why in God's name would you want that bucket of bolts?
And... Here is a deposition I have made. If it is not sufficient, I will return to Earth to testify.
Well, Saavik. I guess this is goodbye.
Don't know anything about it? I find it difficult to believe that I've come millions of miles --
Doctor Nichols, I might have something to offer <u>you</u>.
Ojichan? Akira ojichaan dewa naino? Koko de nani shiteru no?  
My people have a strict policy of non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it's our Prime Directive.
Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as well.  I don't intend to let them.
Most of my people who live that faster pace would sell their souls to slow it down.
I wonder if you're aware of the trust you endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it's unusual for...
But I have three hundred and eighteen days of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.
Do you really think your mighty Federation would be interested in protecting six hundred people?
There is no need for concern. I am operating within normal parameters now.
My father told me I shouldn't talk to you.
I know why.  So people like us won't be afraid of you any more.
No... I want to stay with you...
To many offlanders, what you have here would be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum.  And I'm afraid it's the reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.
Hello, Data...
... it is conceivable I was shot to protect the secret of its existence.
Why would the Federation or the Son'a wish to move the Ba'ku?
Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer...
It isn't safe for you to remain in this area.
Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.
The Enterprise can be at your position in two days, Admiral...
Captain, I wasn't expecting you.
All right. You have twelve hours, Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we'll be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son'a reinforcements in case you fail.
That's why we put chromodynamic shields in place - so our people wouldn't feel the effects from the metaphasic radiation...
With metaphasics, lifespans will be doubled... an entire new medical science will evolve...  I understand your Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life... would you take his sight away from him?
Order them to surrender, and I promise you won't be court- martialed.
A coward... without the moral courage to stop an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.
Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?
The injector performs perfectly in every simulation...
Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for diner. Deploy the collector.  Do you have a problem with those orders?
Moving them is one thing. Killing them all...
The torque sensors are out of alignment... by twelve microns... you could hear that?
By a Son'a weapon.  There's no doubt about it, sir. That's what made Data malfunction.
His ethical and moral subroutines took over all of his basic functions...
Implants bothering you?
Aye, sir. Highly volatile...I recommend we keep our distance...
Sir, they've detonated an isolytic burst... a subspace tear is forming...
What's inside that nebula cluster?
They need us to mediate some territorial dispute...
... and gorgonzolla cheese.
Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we haven't left yet...
Prepare the ship for departure at oh-seven-hundred hours.
Would you like something to eat?
Worf, you must hurry...
I've already modified a tricorder with one of his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters but it should shut him down...
Come out, come out wherever you are...
All injector sub-systems are confirmed off-line.
Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That's not in here...
The Son'a discovered an M-class planet with humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it's in us to get approval for a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint mission...
I don't see anything to suggest the Son'a have any interest in sociology...
What you're doing to my neck...
This isn't one of the usual therapeutic postures...
Why don't you try sitting up?
... I'm not sleeping well...
This ship is equipped with fourteen long range transporters... are they all useless...?
The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own.  But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it?
Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive?
It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding.
But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain.
Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that.
Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I...
Is it Japanese?
No. I will not betray my friends.
I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now.
It has entered Earth orbit.  Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface.
Who are you?
This must be it.
Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched.
Picard to Enterprise.  Enterprise, please respond.
Ready to make a little history?
The nacelles are charged... nuclear warhead standing by. We're ready to ignite the warp drive.
They're getting awfully close... what the hell are they doing?
Where are you from most recently?
And what were you doing out at the missile silo?
What do you want?
What are you, an idiot? Didn't you see the red light was on?
Did you need something?
I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in --
Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important.
I'd say you already have.
We?
Track their weapons fire.
They must've done it in the past... they went back and changed history...
Report.
Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious.
I have assigned two damage control teams to locate the source of our communication problems. So far, they've had no success.
We saw at least thirty...and there are twenty-two Enterprise crewmembers reported missing... including Commander Data.
To control the Enterprise, they'll have to gain access to one of two locations. Main Engineering... or the Bridge.
What are they doing?
You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation.  There's only one torpedo left...
Someone...?
I remember it made me sick.
What the hell happened down there, Worf?
Mr. President we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
Spock, that was actually funny.
Calm yourself, doctor, the operation is almost complete...
Pity they're retiring us just as I was starting to understand you, Spock...
Thanks...
ABSOLUTELY NOT!
Time we got underway ourselves, gentlemen.  Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
This is fun...
Too bad we can't SMELL her.
I don't believe we can get more out of the way than this.
What are you in for, if you don't mind me asking?
They'll respect him now...
"To be or not to be, that is the question" which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk. We need BREATHING room...
He's a DOCTOR!
Under article 184 of Interstellar Law, I place you both under arrest. You are charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
What?
And you still maintain your ship did not fire on Kronos One? Would you have known if she had? Come now, Captain. The record clearly there were no other ships in the sector.
And what did they tell you?
Louder, please. We cannot hear you.
Where is Mr. Sulu?
Captain, you're not going to show them the bridge??
Captain, if they fire at us with our shields down --
From Starfleet?
She's here - somewhere.
Shields. Battle stations.
Mr. Chekov, slow down. Take us forward, thrusters only, one quarter impulse power.
This is the first evidence that corroborates our theory.
Aye, sir.
An INCIDENT?
Thank you, Captain.
We'd be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
Chancellor, may I present Commander Spock, whom I believe you know, Dr. Leonard McCoy, chief medical officer, Montgomery Scott, chief engineer...
Listen. No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Maybe if their particles just got a wee bit mixed...
As you were. Lieutenant...?
Aye, sir.
Captain, our shields -- !
Who is "US?"
This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
Where?
Captain...
The peace conference.
Are you dining on worms?
What's she waiting for?
Control tower, reading, Sir.
Channel open, Captain.
Gorkon's own man??
You have done well, Saavik. As your sponsor at the Academy I have followed your career with... satisfaction. And as a Vulcan.
You must have faith.
How did you - ?
Her own father...?
If you are logical.
Perhaps neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant. There were things I tried to tell you too - about having faith.
Apparently they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
You can check the torpedoes visually, if you like -
And if they're still in place?
A Bird of Prey canna fire when she's cloaked!
I assume command of this ship as of  0130 hours. Uhura, send to Starfleet HQ. Explain precisely what has taken place, and request instructions.
Sulu's giving us his position and telling us he's standing by...
Can you tell me how you came to be on the planet where we found you?
Do you know the name of the Captain of this vessel?
Why?
Why?
Do you know anything about Shinzon's plans against the Federation?
Do you have any knowledge of the tactical abi1ities of this ship?
No. I must deactivate you.
It has the ability to consume organic material at the subatomic level. I can't overestimate the danger of Thalaron radiation, Jean Luc. A microscopic amount could kill every living thing on this ship in a matter of seconds.
I so wanted to believe Shinzon. But the Thalaron radiation can't be explained away. Whatever he's after, it's not peace.
A weapon.
Yes, sir.
What do you imagine this is?
We are passing through the Bassen Rift. The projections will return when we have cleared it.
Why am I looking at me?
Isolated pockets of humanoids. It appears to be a pre-warp civilization at an early stage of industrial development.
I feel nothing, Geordi. It is my belief that with my memory engrams he will be able to function as a more complete individual.
Yes.
We have lost structural integrity on decks twelve through seventeen, sections four through ten.
What is our approximate distance?
It's you.
No.
Really, Captain, it was a lovely toast.
The B-9 is like a slow child, sir. And Data, in his own way, has assumed the position of a parent or guardian. I'm afraid he has expectations based on his own experiences. He'll be disappointed when the BI-9 cannot meet those expectations.
Sir, the strongest sense I had was that he's more than urious about you. He very much wants to know you.  The same way you want to know him.
Shinzon's Viceroy seems to have the ability to reach into my thoughts. I've become a liability... I request to be relieved of my duties.
How can you be certain?
Captain Picard, Commander Donatra of the Warbird Valdore. Might we be of assistance?
The Empire considers this a matter of internal security. We regret you've become involved.
It's very faint but I've isolated it to the third planet in the Kolarin system.
I thought Thalaron radiation was theoretical.
Geordi, put 211 power to the engines.  Take it from life support if you have to -- everything you can give me.
Prepare for a site-to-site transport.

To find the head, sir?
What's this?
Diverting to the Kolarin system takes us awfully close to the Romulan Neutral Zone.
I think it's worth a look. Don't worry, Number One, we'll get you to Betazed with time to spare.
Captain, I hope I don't have to remind you --
It's working.
Oh boy. Destroy humanity and the Federation is crippled.
The Titan's a fine ship, will. And she's getting a captain worthy of her.
Anything.
On the world I come from there's no light. No sun. Beauty isn't important. I see now there's a world elsewhere.
You know I need to verify this.
Romulan ale -- I'm surprised. I can't stand it.
For thousands of years the Romulan Senate has met in this chamber and dictated the fate of its sister-planet... But the time has come for us to live as equals.
I want to know  where I come from. The Remans gave me a future. You can tell me about my past.
Were we always explorers?
So I'm not as tall as you expected?
It's about destiny, Picard. About a Reman outcast who...
You can't trace my holographic emitters, Captainn. So don't bother. And you can't contact Starfleet. We're quite alone.
Yes.
That's your life... not mine.
Well, that sounds relaxing too.
The bond is broken.
What is it?!! Focus on your job!!
How many Warbirds will you need?
But surely...
Then I don't understand the reason for the delay!
Then perhaps you will enlight- en us?
Benny, God, take it easy...
What can I do for you folks?
Credit card.
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money.
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
I don't like it, George...
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
Hello George.
What's all this for?
George... Do you hear me, George?
I just retired.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
What?
Ah... no...
What?!
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
What?
Go.
What?
Are you from up there? Space?
Shit.
I will see it next time.
When do you have to be here?
Sun...
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
No... The closest...
What is hitchhike?
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Yes.
Nobody knows.
You can have one.
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
What are you saying?
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
You are cold.
What?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Oh, you're pretty...
The cook again?
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
What will you say about us?
How long will it take you to get home?
Where do you think you're going?
Jesus Christ!! You crazy people...
Help me!!!
I told you I'm looking for someone.
Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody.
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
That's because the ones that were hurt, died. They couldn't talk to you.
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
To the same woman?
Where are you going?
Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living?
Is there a reward in this?
Eh... the store tells you to call when there's trouble, so they won't get sued... But that shouldn't matter if there's a reward, right?
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
Come on, let's go, I got to get back.
Some tips.  Don't dart your eyes around.  Don't look in the mirror or you'll ID yourself.  OK?  You got a half hour of tape, so give me some lead-in to the main event.  But don't wait too long, I don't want to be going out for popcorn.  And don't act natural.  Don't act at all. Just forget the thing is on.  Got it?
He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news.  An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
You said you were going to get her out of this.
Hi, baby.  I've missed you.
He has his uses too.
You have to get out of here.  If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy.  He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid.  He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Yeah, for about a month now.  Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay?  And stay away from me.  Stop trying to rescue me.  Those days are over. I'm a big girl now.  Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny.  Coming here... Tran's just in there.
Who did it?
You see the look on that preppy puke's face?  Fuckin' pissed in his Topsiders.
I'm telling ya, it's over.  We used it all up--
Let's work it.
He's in this somehow... I don't know how.  Just stay close to Faith.
2-2-0-3.  Got it.  Stay on her.
I'll have that.  Glock 22.  Nice.
Only he doesn't know about me and Faith.  So I say to myself, if I turn the job down, he just gets somebody else.  And I lose Faith... to coin a phrase.  So to buy time, I do the skank.  I still gotta do something about Tran... I figure it's him or me... but I can't cap him without a chump to take the fall.  And who better than his girlfriend's loser ex-boyfriend... a known criminal... who has been seen hassling them in public numerous times.
Don't have a fucking coronary, Lenny.
I don't deal black-jack clips!  It's policy.  I got ethics here.
I said that?  Look, I'll take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.
Iris, man.  Pay attention.
I don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it.  Said I wouldn't want to see it.  She said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. Like insurance or somethin'
I always do.
Greetings, gents.  So let's hear this week's sad story.
Jeez, you're pathetic.  Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James.  I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
What the fuck are you doing?
I thought we were friends.
Macey... I've never seen you like this.
What is it?
Blackjack?  I don't understand--
Cause you're the man, right?  The Magic Man.  If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Uh unh.  No way!  They'd crucify me.
If he could do what's on that tape, he's a sicko.
And what about the guy that was following me?
How's Zander?
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
Lenny, give them the tape.
Shit!
Those two guys were cops.
So, let's see, I've got Tran's goons, some squidhead psycho and the LAPD all trying to kill me.  Happy new year, Lenny.
There's a plus side?
The only card we have to play is the tape.  You know, we get it to the media somehow...
Whatya mean?  We're going!  Tran's gonna do her right there unless--
I worked Vice, Narcotics... Violent Crimes... and I saw every known depravity.  I was lost, Mace.  In outer darkness.  Then I busted this strung-out little teeny-hooker. When I met Faith she was just another runaway giving twenty dollar blowjobs to buy crank.  Another lost soul.
But she was different.  There was a light in her eyes... and she had this voice.  It was scary, all that pain coming out of that little body. Like she could take all the hurt and rage of the entire world and lift it up to heaven in one voice.  I helped her.  And I promised her that I'd always be there... to protect her.  See?  It's not about what's in her head.  It's what's in mine.  I can't let go of the promise.  It's... like... it's all I have left.
Got your ticket?
You see Tran?
Alright.  We're going up.
Well...  Get going.  You're still bleeding.
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there.  Let's go.  Chop chop.
Problem is, Lenny knows everybody.
Was this him?
Testa?
Agents Duncan, Mackelway.  Anything new?
Anybody talk to the press?
Agent Mackelway.
Oh Jesus, Sheriff, I am sorry. I meant to call you -- I got distracted -- the Sumpter girl was not one of Speck's victims. That's the good news.
Show's over, boys. Nobody home.
Hi there.
You have the body?
A grill pattern.
Be my guest, Agent Kulok, scrub suits are in the back.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
You can't imagine how many men have told me that.
You... surprised me.
Ah... restaurant supplies. I didn't get your name.
Yeah.
What?
I've been looking for you.
Deputy Director, get out, sir.
Mackelway, I could understand. He is over-emotional by nature, but you, Agent Kulok, you had a shining career in front of you.
Look, sorry. Don't say a word.  I know this is improper. I've been trying to speak with Deputy Director Koessler. I left a message. I must speak with you before you go back to Washington.
Its called insubordination.
We had every reason to believe he was on that plane. He was supposed to be on the plane. Everything was incinerated, it was two weeks before we reached the crash site. We, the Director and I, decided it was in everyone's best interest to declare Dick Low dead. That way he could exit a hero.
Dunlevy said there was another case, Ron Rice. In fact, there were two earlier cases where serials were murdered. The second was George Sheldon. I didn't enter it into VICAP -- I'll get you the file.
You didn't tell anyone where you were?
He's got you believing in Zero now too.
Have you told Richard Low about Amarillo?
Hawkins isn't the target, Richard Low's the target.
You are so fucked up.
Thanks for the ride.
You used to be in the Behavioral Science Unit, right?
Doesn't fit.
Yes I do.
Relax.  J. Edgar's greatest fear: a female with a badge.
People end up in occupations for a reason. They may think not, but they do: occupations define us.
What's that?
Look at this fellow... or this one.
None. Can't find a thing. Nothing on file, nothing online. It's not a part of any known killer's signature.
It's a no-no.
I've been thinking about this.
He's called a couple times.
Mack, I'm sorry. I apologize. I should have called. I had no right to sneak in on you like that.
I came over because I couldn't sleep and was lonely. I wanted to see you. I thought I'd surprise you.
And nobody else can do that?
Hello?
This feels like something out of a spy novel.
Probably. I told him Koessler had ordered the report, kept it secret.
I'd be real careful if I were you.
But why this pattern?
Tom, you okay?
You okay?
Zero abducts victims all over the country, kills them, keeps them refrigerated for days, weeks, even months, then buries them hundreds, thousands of miles away. Karen Sumpter was buried, washed up in a flood. Evans was buried. When we get Zero, we'll find boneyards all across the country.
Okay, I'll unhook you. No weapon.
Bitch! Cunt! Please, please, please don't do this, Agent Kulok. You need me.
Dave Koessler must have you jumping through hoops.
What was your weakness, sir?
Suspect Zero?
It's my master list of missing persons: men, boys, girls, children over the last ten years. Two hundred and eighty-five names. A pool of possible victims.
[Reality very risky.]
[Lionheart, what happened?]
[You want to talk, Lionheart, or you want to take this a little more personal?]
[If you wanted a good steak, you should have gone to Omaha.]
Not everything is imputed to memory. The most confidential stuff is kept top secret hard copy. Why would the Zero file be kept secret?
I want to go live with you.
Leave this room, I'll go back with you, blow your cover.
Yes, sir.
Updating the condition of all Bureau- owned vehicles in the southwest sector, sir.
"Attitude Adjustment Issues" -- what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Headed there now. The same shift will be on at noon.
But why attack an Agent?
I don't think you understand.
You have to put things in perspective.
You really should. Life, after all, is really just a series of challenges...
How are you ladies doing this evening?
Well, you know, it's tough. A lot of traveling. A lot of hotels... but, you know, it's a dream... and the money's really good. I think I might buy another really expensive imported car after my next gig in Vegas...
Are you sure? Maybe...
Like the quiche?
I like quiche.
What else?
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
Did you, um, did you get that pilot?
...not until you book it...
It's like, you looked at my tape. You saw my picture. Why did you call me in? You knew I was twenty-four.
Let me just check on my boy.
He's so sweet. He really said that?
Can I get you something else? I mean, you shouldn't leave without getting something for free.
You have to lay it on the table.
Why not?
Well, who represents you back east?
I'm sure she'll call. Six years is a long time. You don't just break it off cleanly after six years.
It's a rebound.
I'll have to come see you sometime.
...Which one...?
...well, it suits you...
Hello?
How's it going? It's been a while...
Good.  I think about things.
Yeah.
You know, us.
It doesn't matter. I think about you every day.
Hi.
So I don't call either way.
Rob, I just want you to know, you're the only one I can talk to about her.
There's just something about being "Goofy". Any other Disney character would be fine. There's just this stigma associated with the character.
I didn't mention her once today.
You want to hit the town tonight?
How many strokes?
I'll give you an eight. 
An eight.
Kinda money, huh?
I'll get a Dewars rocks... 
I can't get over how cute the girls in this city are.
I can't wait till I actually get to touch one of them.
Oh, like that song...
Then why won't she call...?
How did you get over it? I mean how long 'til it stopped hurting?
By the way, the guys back home said she put on some weight.
...which means no one will get there 'til ten.
Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message. 
Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message. 
Excuse me. We're in a bit of a hurry.
I'm serious. This is how you do it. I'm telling you.
Wake up, baby.
They're all skanks.
Cut that shit out.
It doesn't matter...
First let's see what happens if we play it cool.
Always, baby.
Hey, man, I'm down too, you know.
Baby, you're money. You're the big winner.
What an asshole.
Let's go. I'm not paying for a room, and if we don't leave now we'll never make it.
I don't think so.
That's bullshit.
It's just tough, after sleeping with someone you love for so long, to be with someone new... who doesn't know what I like... and you gotta wear a jimmy...
No, man. I need to use the phone.
She asked me what I was thinking about? What should I have done? Lie?
Christy was nice...
I just don't think she liked me in that way.
Tee, girls don't go for me the way they go for you.
I hear she's getting real fat.
You guys are such assholes.
What time's this party tonight?
Was I money?
You're not just, like, fucking with me?
How long do I wait to call?
Guys... Guys... I got it under control.
Oh, it's on, baby...
Is she looking now?
...but it's worth the risk. True or false: It's worth the risk.
...we're not...
...you're so fuckin mmmoney.
...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
...Sue...
It's on...
It's on.
Sorry man.
...One fifty-nine, Two minutes.
The Don himself is coming to me tonight?
No.  You ask for too much.
You never think to protect yourself with real friends.  You think it's enough to be an American.  All right, the Police protects you, there are Courts of Law, so you don't need a friend like me. But now you come to me and say Don Corleone, you must give me justice. And you don't ask in respect or friendship.  And you don't think to call me Godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.
Be my friend.
Eat it, it's on the table.
That's all?  Don't you want me to send some people over here?
You take care of Paulie?
You're on, kid...I'll square it with Mom your not seeing her before you left.  And I'll get a message to your girl friend when I think the time is right.
Outside.
I'll think about it.
Good for ten men...
You think we'll go for that last place?
You look terrible.  I want you to eat well, to rest.  And spend time with your family.  And then, at the end of the month, this big shot will give you the part you want.
Is it necessary?
When I meet with Tattaglia's people; should I insist that all his drug middle-men be clean?
He was the one behind Sollozzo?
Tom, I never thought you were a bad Consigliere, I thought Santino a bad Don, rest in peace.  He had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when I had my misfortune.  Michael has all my confidence, as you do.  For reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.
What was this for?
I see you have your Luca Brasi.
Your wife and children...you're happy with them?
Godfather, you understand everything.
Don Tommassino.
I know.
Corleone.
What is it?
We hear.  We were told you were a Pezzonovanta...big shot.
Hey, beautiful girls!
You look wonderful, kid; really wonderful.  That doctor did some job on your face.
Mike!  The party starting!
The old man wants you; Johnny's here...he's got a problem.
Is the hospital covered?
Tom, you're the Consigliere, what do we do if the old man dies?
Pop, they hit us and we hit them back.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Hello Kay.  Your father's inside, doing some business.  He's been asking for you.
Bookkeepers know everything. Rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing.  They get a little more money than the job's worth.  Lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
Then Luca turned to the other man...
Tom...Tom, I'd like you to meet Kay Adams.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
I don't think so.  You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo?  They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Michael, it's not true.  Please tell me.
Oh no you can't, the old man'd be sore as hell if I let you get mixed up in this.
Clemenza?  No, I don't believe it.
Mike, good to see you.  Got everything you want?
You goddamn dagos.  I do you a favor and take Freddie in when you're having a bad time, and then you try to push me out.
I have to go back to New York tomorrow.  Think of your price.
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
What? What?
Hi Tom.
I'll come down.
I like to sail, believe me, I love to sail! Instead I make boats and other people sail them.
I met him in New York.
I'm never going back!
Good afternoon!
Could we sail to Venice?
That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
I know. I write like a child.
Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
What's the fight about? That's her fiancee, isn't it? Are they blaming him?
Esatto. I'm always planning.
Then I'll take it as a compliment.
Ha.
Yesterday you're ogling girls on the terrace, today you're getting married. It's absurd.
The funny thing -- I'm not pretending to be somebody else and you are. I'm absolutely honest with you. I've told you my feelings. But you, first of all I know there's something -- that evening when we played chess, for instance, it was obvious --
Come on, Frederico, do you really have to go back? At least stick around for the Festival of the Madonna.
I'm well, thank you.
Yes it is.
Yes. What's the detective hoping to find in San Remo?
And his passport photo? Did you hear? To scratch out your own face like that -- can you imagine -- the frame of mind you'd have to be in?  I've thought about going to the police but I can't face it. I can't face anything anymore.
Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
Is Mr Greenleaf here?
I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine.
Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me.
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
Is he really not here?
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home.  I'm going to go home.
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
I was looking forward to seeing him.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
I told you! I knew it!
Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith --  God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
What's your secret?
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
Let's go.
Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
My God.
Peter, I'm really sorry to put you through this. I just couldn't face going to the police by myself when my Italian's so rotten.
Anyway I've got to the bottom of the delay. Finally. We're waiting for someone from Rome.
Can you imagine, if Dickie did kill Freddie, what must that be like? To wake up every morning, how can you? Just wake up and be a person, drink a coffee...?
I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep.
Do you want me to stick around?
Hello. What are you up to?
Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
What are you talking about -- you're not a nobody! That's the last thing you are.
And don't forget. I have the key.
So, the Doctor, he has to make the --  -- come se dice?
Can we go up? Do you mind?
I really don't want to see anybody.
Thank you.
Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on. Nothing beats quality.  You interested in an automatic?
Nah, this'll be fine.
Is there a firing range around?
You want to canvass?
I don't know...
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
Where do you live?
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
What did you do?
That's really something.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
What hours do you work?
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
You know what you remind me of?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction". 
The singer?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
So you haven't heard this record yet?
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
No, no, please. This fare's on me. Please.
Tom, come here a moment.  I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county.  And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Sure we could run him. You realize he's already head of his block association.
No, why?
Oh, are you all right?
No, why?
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
What is your name? My name is Travis.
Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still.
...he called up the Dispatcher last night. Charlie McCall, our dispatcher...
Fuckin' One-Ball.
Stick up?
Where.
Well... I guess so.
What's your real name?
Can't you listen to me? Don't you want to get out of here?
Do they drug you?
Don't you want to go?
Can I see you again?
No, I mean really. This is nothing for a person to do.
I ain't ever been there, but it don't seem like such a bad place.
How?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
Sure you don't want to come with me?
Nice talking to you, Travis.
No trouble with the Hack Bureau?
No, I want long shifts.
No.
Are you a Secret Service Man?
Sure, Henry. I got it all. We'll send you all the stuff all right.
Anything you say, officer.
I saw. $20 fifteen minutes. $30 half hour.
I'm no cop.
I'm hip.
Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it. It becomes what he is. Why fight it? What do you know? How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in.
You fit in. It's lonely, it's rough at first. But you fit in. You got no choice.
Stick with Carla.
Thank you.
He says he's leaving the island sir.
Just come and get me, sir.  I'm tired.
Well yes I suppose ...
John Mason.  ' Don't be shocked.  I don't have much time.  Please listen carefully  ....
Limp dick?
Mason.  Mason?
Partners?
St. Michael's Church, Fort Walton, Kansas.  Front pew.  Right leg. = Hollow.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
What about you, Delly?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
I think  it's worse  now.
I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst.
Do you... remember me?
Me too.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
Nine hundred...
Well, there's got to be a way...
When did you start smoking?
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Huh.  That was nice of me.
Now, did you remember that, or...
Sir, that is true.
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Yes it does.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give before this committee of the United States House of Representatives will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you god?
Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back.
Wait'll you see the inside!
This is the staff of the Bijou.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make.  What are those?
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Luke... what time is it?
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it?
Zackly.
Too bad.  He says I'm a communist.
'Sides, car's right outside.  I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
Any idea how you got here, son?
What is it?
Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'?
You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk.
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
Please, sit.
I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident.
Ancestors?
I suppose.  Thanks.
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
I don't understand.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
I see.
I did.
And the second?
Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.  He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice.
Yes, I did.
Could I have a puff?
Don't you like Bodega Bay?
Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge.
Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
We've got an extra room upstairs and everything.
Mitch, let's turn back.
And the white house?
I see. How do I get down there?
Thank you.
How much for the phone calls?
What good'll that do? Smoke's as bad as birds.
One apple pie! You want more coffee?
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Whose side are you on?
How long have you known her?
She was selling birds.
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Yes?
Mother, get a rope!
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
We won't be here.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
No.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
I couldn't ask you to.
That's a chimney swift, all right.
There's an ordinance against burning anything in this town, unless it's...
Is that for Mitch Brenner?
Well, where did he go?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
I understand completely, sir.
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds... 
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Some of them are.
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
Can't see a thing.
Certainly, but...
With... with Annie, of course.
Will I be seeing you again?
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
What did it say?
But you tore it up.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
I have several jobs.
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
Last night? What do you mean?
It smelled of the fire.
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
I keep thinking of Annie. 
Where are they heading?
Santa Rosa?
When will they stop?
The power.
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
Yes, certainly. 
What do you think they were after, Miss...?
I don't know why.
Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity?
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
Help how? What do you want to do?
I'm only a student.
You have his promise, then?
Good morning, Mrs. Marsh.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
He's not home.
You know how we get the specimens we use for dissection?
And that's why you don't want to be a doctor, Fettes?
It was about last night I wanted to talk to you -- about the operation on the little Marsh girl.
But you did promise.
I wouldn't do that, Fettes.  I wouldn't report it.
Here is where you must watch closely, gentleman -- closely -- it is the very heart of the matter --
I just saw Gray.  What was he laughing at?
See that, Fettes?
This is not a woman!
Why do you want the white horse to bid you "good-day"?
Come, Toddy -- come.  Sit down here with me.
Mr. Fettes and I have professional matters to discuss.
You're a teacher, eh?  Maybe you're afraid to be a doctor, Toddy.
Afraid you are not as good a doctor perhaps as you make out to be.
Oh, it's you, Gray. Well, come in. Sit down. Have a glass with me.
Did he tell you how thoughts come and how they go and why things are remembered and forgot?
But why, Gray? Why?
What did you hear?
"A good-day to you Madame Tosspot, and would you like a little glass of something before you take your rest? Come with me to my house and I'll make you my guest. You shall have quarts to drink if you like."  Ah, how he cozened them.
I don't understand the song. Tell me plain how they did it.
Was the paralysis immediate?
Crony indeed!
Fettes -- where is Fettes?
What's been holding me together is the hope that maybe you do go someplace. And I'll be seeing her again soon. Only what will I say? That I was too stupid to find the guy who killed her? That he's down here laughing?
Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
One chance to tell the truth, Tommy. Who is the man with the scar? He planted this in my car.
Fucking Zombie.
Are you out of your fucking mind? We're going to die.
You killed that cop Dutton.
I know who you are.  That's why you paint your face. To hide.
No...
No. You don't.
You know what Lauren and I were fighting about that night? She had a secret, wouldn't tell me...
It's ok, it's ok...
Erlich gimping around in his goddamn hot rod is not discreet. I've got reporters asking me how much he made. I've got the entire force looking at this case now.
Tommy Leonard. The eyewitness in the Corvis case.
Guy dressed for Halloween?
They botched the execution.
An accident, Nathan.
You want me to walk a straight line?
Stay in the car. I'll only take a second.
What is it?
It still doesn't mean...
I think I dropped an earring.
You're in with them.
Stay away from me! Stay away!
They killed her because she found out.
As though unsure of what he's heard) Yes -- yes, I have.
We had our atomic wars -- thousands of years ago.  After that we fought with bows and arrows. Then, slowly, we learned that fighting is no solution -- that aggression leads to chaos.
I gather that your efforts on the official level were not entirely successful.
Such power exists?
Hi Mom!
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
I mean -- on account of that policeman last night.  You think he's a bank robber, maybe? Or a gangster?
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
Are you an FBI man?
Well -- Professor Barnhardt, I guess. He's the greatest scientist in the world.
Sure. Right near where my mother works.
You think it can go faster than an F- 36?
Maybe four thousand miles an hour. And outside the Earth's atmosphere a good deal faster.
You think they'll ever find him?
Mr. Carpenter -- what does velocity mean?
What does that mean?
Go to the movies.
Let's not say anything to my mother about this, Mr. Carpenter.
Aw, gee -- we didn't finish our story.
All you have to remember is, first find the common denominator -- then subtract.
Bobby -- have you a flashlight?
What do you want it for, Mr. Carpenter?
I don't believe it.
How does he explain that?
It's rather difficult for us to think of another planet as a neighbor.
Perhaps you'd rather discuss it personally with the President--
I'm afraid that would be a little awkward. It's -- it's completely without precedent. And there are practical considerations -- the time involved -- the enormous distances.
Before making any decisions, I think I should get out among your people -- become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.
Well, we could--
I'm at Bleeker's getting an appraisal on that diamond. I thought we might have lunch together.
Helen, he's the man from the space ship!  I had that diamond checked at three different places. Nobody on earth's ever seen a stone like that! After what Bobby told us, that's enough for me. Why is it nobody knows anything about him? Why hasn't he got any money?
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
Excuse me. I was just going up to my room.
I'm sure Barnhardt can arrange to hide me until the meeting.
But how -- how long--?
How dare you write on that blackboard!  Do you realize the Professor has been working on that problem for weeks?
Your name's Carpenter -- that right?  Any identification, Mr. Carpenter? Driver's license -- social security number?
Okay -- book him and get him fixed up.  Looks like everybody's goin' nuts.
People get hysterical enough, they do anything.  Look, Mr. Carpenter -- if you can't identify yourself, I got to send you over to the Army.
May I suggest that you call the Professor?
<u>I'll</u> have to drive!
The nightcrawler.  The bloodsucker.
Should I run him through?
Shut up!
Don't!  Stop!
What's going' on?
Where is she?!
With him?
Leave him alone.
I have something to tell you guys.  Not only is my own brother showing systems of being a vampire... but now I'm convinced my mother's <u>dating</u> one!
Oh, no...
No, Nanook!  Quiet!
I can't sleep with the closet door open, either.  Not even a crack.  Your father doesn't mind, though. It could be wide open for all he cared.  I think one of the reasons I divorced him was because he never believed... in the horror... of the <u>closet monster</u>!
Grandpa, the Widow Johnson called. She said to pick her up a seven instead of eight.
I guess so.  She said not to be late.
It's early.  Why do we have to go home?
Ocean air!
Do you mind?  It was a real scary comic.
Well if we're in your way we can just eat peanut butter out of the jar in the kitchen.
There's nothing wrong with Max.  I don't know why you don't --
Ohmygod...
Not impressed, are you?
Yeah.  Runaways, mostly.  They come from all over.  Attracted by the boardwalk and the ocean.  Lucy... listen I know I have no right to ask you this... but don't look for another job just yet... I mean besides being the best employee I have... I think you're cute.
This looks terrific, Lucy.
I'm really sorry, Max.
Maybe this is the night where everything finally goes right for a change.
Something the matter?
Let me tell you something about boys.  They're like weeds.  They grow best when they're ignored.
Are you hungry?  Wanna get something to eat?
Ouch.
You've got to put this on.
It's gone.  I feel it!
Grandpa does not own a T.V.  Have you noticed?  There's no T.V. Santa Carla has no malls, no Cineplexes and now I won't even have MTV.  I will not know anything hip happening anymore.
You're beautiful.
Where are we going?
Then what's the rush?  You're chasing that girl, why don't you just admit it?  I'm at the mercy of your sex glands!
Mom, you hitched all the way to Berkeley once, remember?
Lose the earring, Michael.  It's not happening.  It's just not happening.
Michael?
What??
No!  We can't tell Mom!  Please, Sam.  Don't tell her.
It's that girl from the boardwalk. Is she one of them?
Sixteen.
Was that dog, the Norwegian dog?
Listen to me, Garry.  Please...
What you doin'?
How you doin', old boy?
Somebody broke in.
Childs!!
I said where?  Where'd you go?!
Cut that out, Copper.  Nauls?  What's taking you?!
Somebody's taken it.  I can't find it!
MacReady!
... So it crashes, and this guy, whoever he is, gets thrown out, or walks out, and ends up freezing.
I can get maybe another five or six feet out of it.
Torch them!!
Palmer, you and Copper tie everyone down.  Real tight.
Would that test have worked?
Now hold him.
... Guys as crazy as that could have done a lot of damage to their own before they got to us.
Hold on, damn it.  We're getting nowhere... If this bit of Blair's about absorbing and imitating is true... then that dog could have gotten to anybody.
We're a thousand miles from anybody else, man.  It's going to get a hell of a lot worse before it gets better.
Put that down!
Let's rush him.  He's not going to blow us all up.
Pure nonsense.  This won't prove a damn thing.
What's...
What if it doesn't come?
This storm do that?
... Hey, somebody!  Open up, it's me, MacReady...  ... Come on, damn it... The towline snapped.  Been crawling around like a seal out here...
Get back!!
Magnesium of some type... or some kind of strange alloy.  And those poor dumb bastards had to go and blow the hell out of it.
Somebody else sure as hell thought so.
You hear that?
It's in between us and them!!  How we going to get back?!
Ah... no.
Kalen... Do you have any idea where they take them?
Sir... have you a name?
Regenerating fission reactor, you wouldn't understand.  It's power is well beyond your neanderthal cranial capacity.
Send him away.
Yes...
Vox?
Why did they built it?
This has to end.
You took her because she helped me.
She won't remember you.  None of them will.  You will be forgotten. That is how history works.
May I help you?
You're late.
Admiration?  My my.
Oh dammit, I love you!  I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think, all I do is moon over you and -- hum, apparently.
Darling.
All right...
Let's walk through the park...
Alex...?!
They are rare...  ... Orion's belt, pointing to the earth --
Heavens, look at that now!
Alex... people are staring.
Damned if I can keep her out of my equations.
Look at them, Philby, all alike, everyone in an identical bowler hat.  Do you want your students to turn out like them?
The most able inventor I know and you can't tie a simple four-in- hand.
That's absurd --
And your jewelry too.  I guess we could consider this your first little bump on the road to married bliss.
You're up!  You must be feeling better --
His curiosity is amazing.
It's hard for me to imagine a better place.  Where I come from there's so much... frenzy.  Day and night.  It seems we're all running faster and faster...  ... All in identical bowler hats.
That machine --
Is he all right?
You seem fascinated by the stars.
Yes.
This is magnificent...
This is where my journey started... right here.
Kalen...
Oh, I'm already swooning.
Yes, sir, he --
All right, Mrs. Watchit.  You can go.
As I recall the syllabus the name of your tutorial is "Applied Mathematics and Engineering", am I correct?
And roosters.
My equations are not parlor-tricks!
He said he traveled for two months.
To live in.  There's a lot of us... beyond the valley.
I found you.  I saved your life. You were bleeding all over the place!
We'll see about that.
Kalen, it's all right, I'm here --
Hello, Mrs. Watchit.  You're looking in the pink.
I wonder if that poor girl has any idea what she's in for?
Should we be...
I'm just looking at you. Does that make you uncomfortable?
I don't know better. All I know is that you left me in there.
We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
And what's that?
Becker, how do you sleep at night?
Who are you?
No. I didn't. I swear I didn't. I probably helped push you to kill yourself, but I didn't do it.
The three of you weren't regular patients. You were criminals that ended up at Alpine Grove.
That's right! Goddamn, you're the spitting image. I didn't know he had a son.
We're late.
You look like you've lost some weight. Are you eating?
I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it...
Your mom take anything before this happened?
But I like it I guess.
I think I can remember what's on them.
Jackie, I'm William Starks. I can prove it.
How'd he die?
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
[Beat] You bled to death.
How? Did they figure it out after I died?
I don't believe a thing she just said.
Maybe. I don't know. Seems more likely Becker does, but at the very least she knows how I died.
Me, too.
They're not here.
What? What are you thinking?
Then why isn't there anyone around?
They've got lives to be grateful for.
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
What's happening to me? Why am I getting so much weaker?
I think so.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
What case?
Well, do you think Dr. Becker would have any idea?
You don't understand.
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
Some part of you suspects -- even if you don't know for sure -- that what I'm saying is true.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
He's having absence [pronounced "absance"] seizures when he stares off into space like he does. He has them so often that that's why he hasn't learned to speak properly.
That's Kingsley. Old bastard hears us, I'm sure. He just doesn't want to bother answering so he makes us think he can't talk. I know. I tried it on my mother for two months once before she fished out my tongue. Literally. [Beat] You're the cop killer, right?
Yeah, well 30 times probably would make you seem crazy.
Mortality's actually a great thing to be familiar with. It means you're sane on some level.
It's worse than war. It's worse than anywhere you've ever been.
Can you drive?
No.
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
This is a great song.
But hey, who can forget those words? The man just wants simple and good things for his woman -- that she be warm and happy. How hard can that be to remember?
Hon.
You want anything special for dinner?
Honey?
Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
That's what everybody says.  Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face?  At point blank range?
Who do you think did it?
Weird.  Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
You're gettin' in deeper every moment you're gone.
Alright.
Is this the guy you saw them with?
What kind of gun was it?
It's just not working like this.  We gotta do something.  It'd be one thing if these girls were hardened criminals, but Jesus, Hal, this is makin' us look bad.  I don't know... maybe they're not movin'.  Maybe that little creep lied.
Well, if you don't mind me sayin' so, he sounds like a real asshole.
Louise, is that you?
Well, I guess I'd better...
I don't know.  Nowhere.  What are you doin'?
What did ya do?
Hey, peaches.
So whaddya think.  I mean... I could... uh... get a job.  Of some kind.  I mean you've been tellin' me that for years, right?
Don't worry darlin'.  I'll say I never found you.  I'll say anything you want.  We'll find a way to get you out of this, whatever it is.
Well, wait now.  I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
I don't know.  Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains.  I guess it gets cold at night.  I'm just gonna bring everything.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
'Cause I didn't ask him.
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
Thelma!
Alright...  I changed my mind.  I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
I'm sorry, Louise.  I know you're all upset.  It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess.  I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
Oh my God.
Shouldn't we go to the cops?  I mean, I think we should tell the police.
All of it.  That he tried to rape me.
It means shut up, Thelma.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop.  We'll get a motel room.  I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money.  We're gonna need money.  Thelma.  How much money do you have with you?
Oh, I don't know.  I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
What do you mean?
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home.  I don't know what he's got to be mad about.  I'm the one who should be mad.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
So what are you gonna tell him?
What happened to your hair?
Holy shit.
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
So what's the plan, Thelma?  You just gonna stay drunk?
Thelma.
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open!  We're fugitives now.  Let's behave that way!
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos.
What?!
I told you to slow down.  Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
I don't want to see any more beef jerky.  I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy.  The whole car smells like it.
What?
I said all that?
Thelma, that is not an option.
You awake?
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state.  I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico.  They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
Oh my God!  Louise!  Look!  Look! See if that's him!
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
What?!  What d'you think?!
You're a good friend.
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
What in the hell is that up there?
Go.
We been seein' you all along the way.
You women are crazy!
We're fine!  How are you?
Where you goin'?
S'matter with you? You look like you're fading.
Heavy? Heavy?! What I wouldn't give to know what heavy feels like, you insensitive prick.
Well, uh, can you tell us his name?
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Nah.
I mean since then.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
You're kidding? What did they say?
I don't know about this, Dom.
Never met him.
Got cash.
You know, clean the pipes.
Why's that?
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
Uh-huh. Where was he?
Who?
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
We're in love with your roommate.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
Very nice.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
So where the hell are you, Healy?
Oh yeah.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
I know he's around here someplace.
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
How about -- ?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Lint?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
I guess.
Mary ah, forget it.
Are you okay?
All you want is a phone number?
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
Nope. Never been.
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
Miami?
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
Among others.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
You know, I really should take your card.
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year?  Estadio Olimpico -- please!
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
I'd go with the seven.
Yeah, and you'd probably dump the poor guy halfway to Katmandu.
What? Steve seemed to put up with Warren.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
Good lookin'?
Holy shit...
Magda!
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
By the way, how's he doing?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
You look great.
Now by killer, you mean...?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
What what are you doing here?
Yeah? What do you want?
Is it the frank or the beans?
One guess.
You're looking at him. C'mere and take a look at this beauty.
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
Which is exactly what they appear to be preparing to do, Mr. President. We're tracking 26 ships inbound to Cuba. There's no sign they're changing course. The closest ships, the Gagarin and the Kimovsk, will make the quarantine line by this time tomorrow.
I believe the President made it clear that there would be no firing on ships without his express permission.
This was not the President's intention when he gave that order. What if the Soviets don't see the distention? What if they make the same mistake I just did?  There will be no firing anything near ANY Soviet ships without my express permission, is that understood, Admiral?
This private assurance represents the word of the Highest Authority?
He's right, Jack. Taylor is saying we may have some time. We've got to use it.
As if dealing with the Russians wasn't hard enough, we gotta worry about our own house.
Lying bastard. Lied to my face.
We have to pull him. He's not going to be able to handle the Soviets in front of the U.N. Zorin will eat him alive.
We're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove McCone right.
Jack, I'm as conniving as they come, but a sneak attack is just wrong.
Oh, still sore about this.
The Jupiters are obsolete. They were supposed to have been dismantled last summer anyway --
Hey, Mac. You're up bright and early.
Jack and Bobby are good men. But it takes a certain character, moral toughness to stand up to --
How long until the army is ready?
Guess we can't blame Khruschev for a few patriotic farmers. And the ships?
Then we have no choice.  General, issue the warning orders to our forces. They will be prepared to execute the air strikes Monday morning and the follow-on invasion according to the schedule thereafter. I'll need the official release orders on my desk Sunday night.
Kenny! What happened? They didn't let me up front, said the President was on the phone the whole time.
There are major rail disruptions in the South, two airborne divisions are on alert. That exercise is an invasion.
So what've we got today?
Didn't know Adlai had it in him. Too bad he didn't have this stuff in '52.
They know each other! Khruschev and Feklisov aka Fomin were war buddies!
Don't take it to court, but we've got good circumstantial evidence...  Walter agrees. My gut's telling me Khruschev's turning to a trusted old friend to carry his message.
Moving the line. Stroke of genius.
You must think I'm blind and stupid. I've already gotten the birds and bees from Bobby. The President doesn't have to double-barrel me.
At least it will expose whether Khruschev has been overthrown. We'll know what we're dealing with.
Dangle a settlement, tie us down in negotiations, we come up short...
Bob?
Captain, force the sub to the surface for inspection.
Heroes ain't supposed to shake. I'm shakin', man, look at me.
Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu-- Larry. That's not even your name, is it? What's your real name, you fucking scumbag?
Mr. Clear Moon.
Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don't know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.
Brooks, what's a perceptive fellow like you, doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that Russian shit you like.
You know how in your big cities, you got your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got Indians. That's just the way it is.
Taking ol' Leo somewhere?
We got the wire ya was comin'. You're the Indian official, yeah?
-- an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.
-- violation of the Major Crimes Act on an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Instigation. I know that.
What the hell you doing?!
Were you in Nam?
Leo's gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does quillwork.
What'd she say?
That's good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon run. Let 'em run Upriver.
Your first homicide, that's gonna happen, Ray...
I'll sleep around a little.
Eagle's claws and a bear's balls that's what her profile says.
Tread matches. It's the car.
Jesus, you alright?
We were sworn in on the Constitution to protect federal matters, Ray. I don't know about uranium, I don't know about Red Dog Table -- all I know is we did our job. It's over.
What?!
Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of that print, pressure releases... I'd say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen --
Go back to the M.E., take a look inside Leo's exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me, there ain't chickens in the Badlands. His mother's place is --
Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
What did he say?
Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
Don't be mad. That was just an old traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.
That's not solid.
The old man? He's gonna tell you who killed Leo?
I can't do that,  It's a Rolex.
I can't be dicking around here. That's all I'm saying. I don't carry crystals, I don't wanna come back in another life. I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta here.
Next time I'll be ready. You get the word to who ever it is.
Five-hundred year old turtleshell rattle...
Where's Maggie? Where'd ya take her.
You had a vision. You had yourself a vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.
Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just one of them, what do ya call 'em, fitful dreams?
That's what we're doing here. National interest. National security. Only this time it's not gold. It's uranium.
Alright. Shit's comin' down. He's callin' council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta be at Grandpa's place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together. We need to block this thing.
Ain't no Council Fire, Brother. Clear Moon...
What?
No plates. No registration. Serial numbers removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That's great. This is turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?
Yellow bird... is gonna sing.
I'm not that sure. Yeah, I think --
Since I got a iron pipe put across my knees, man. Fight with three wasi'cus, ya know.
Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, Richard.
I'll bet!
How so?
Where did you see that?
The what?
What would?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Lieutenant...
Why'd you do that?
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
No.
You don't believe that.
Want to play the game?
Goose is dead.
Looks like a tie.
Well... What   is   it?
Tomcats?
Can't shake him.
I've got a six strobe.  I think he's locked on us.
That's missile lock!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
WHAT? WHERE'RE YOU--HEY, WHERE IN THE HELL ARE YOU GOING?
What are you doing?
If I could fly like you I'd have everything I want. If I could fly at all. I can't fly. I can't fly like that. Nobody can. Whatever it is, you've got it!
Ohhh Mother!
Don't WORRY!!!?   You've GOT it!!? Are you CRAZY?
You're not supposed to...
What do you want?
Let me do the talking.
Well, I don't know. That depends.
You ever done this before?
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
What the hell is this?
What what are you doing? We're cover!
I was a victim of circumstance.
Mav's a great flyer but....
It's kind of ironic. All you guys have women troubles and I don't.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
GET LOST!
I've seen this before.
Who's the hell is that?
Helping him in.
You didn't help.
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
I called your house.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
So, where to?
What happened to number five?
Never mind.  Wet a towel and wrap it around your head.  That'll muffle the signal.
Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Brubaker.
Would you like the same suite?
That's what we wanted you to think. The fact is, Hauser volunteered to become Doug Quaid. It was the only way to fool the psychics.
What are you afraid of?  Turn it on.
I say we throw the switch and see what happens.
Kill him.
Listen to me!  He's been going on and on about Mars.  He's really been there.
Your sexual orientation?
Demure, aggressive, sleazy?  Be honest.
What do you want?
Ya know, Doc, you could have folled me.
Mr. Quaid, can you hear yourself? "She's real because you dreamed her?"
Suppose I do...then what?
Mr. Cohaagen wants to see you right away.
Richter!  Call from Cohaagen.
Pull them out.
If we don't hand you over, everybody in the sector'll be dead by morning.
They sell fake memories.
No shit...
You shoulda listened to me, Quaid. I was there to keep you outta trouble.
I want that fucker dead.
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
I've got a lock!  There!
Welcome to JohnnyCab.  Where can I...?
Let's do it.
Doug, maybe we should take a trip.
Well...What do you say?
You are somebody.  You're the man I love.
What are you doing?
I know it sounds crazy, but I went to this Rekall place after work, and...
You call this a paranoid delusion?!
But Doug...There's something I want you to know.  You're the best assignment I ever hand.  Really.
As real as any memory in your head.
All right.
I'm not interested in that.
Ooo, whatcha been feeding that thing?
She wasn't really my wife.
What can I do?
Like what?
Cohaagen knows it makes air.  But the bastard won't turn it on.
What's wrong?
Okay, Burt, listen.  Forget shooting them.  Tell me this: can you get to your truck?
Yeah, like they got a plan...
Miguel, the trouble's come to us. If we're not ready...
You're not getting any penetration, even with the elephant gun.
Knock it off, Burt!
A beauty, isn't it?  We bought three of them for the rec room.
What the hell you doing back already?
Burt, get out!  Get up on your roof or someplace!  We found out what's been killing people!  They're under the ground!
That's fine.  We've got some new things to teach them.
Jesus Christ, we're only going nine miles.  Be there in two hours, tops!
BACK OFF, BURT...!
There's nothing like them in the fossil record, I'm sure...Okay, so they predate the fossil record...  That'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now.  Right.
Hi, guys.  Burt loaned me his camera.
Uh...Digging that waterhole for Nestor.
Who the hell's that?  That's not what's his name...the grad student?
Well, <u>you're</u> the one won't work in the car wash.  You're the one's gotta have a plan.
Jeez, look at that guy.
Oh, Jesus!!
Brother, we decided to leave this place just one day too late, you know?
Car's gone.  We just missed them, that's all.
What the hell are they?
Here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, I guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.
Well, folks, what's the plan?
Shut it up!  Shut the little bastard up!
How the hell long it take <u>you</u> to change a tire?
Its tires are flat...
She likes <u>both</u> of us.  We both helped her out.
Hi, guys, what you been up to?
Ready?
I brought it... to the coroner.
You're fishing. You don't know shit.
You would have the court believe that these two bullets were fired from the same gun?
Gimme back my bottle.
Objection, your Honor! The fact that the witness is currently a patient is immaterial!
-- Then you don't wish to call any witnesses, Mr. Dowd?
You can't come back here... Anything happens to you I'm liable.
Look, I'm a lawyer and --
Hey -- the fact you popped Jimmy Chin in broad daylight proves it wasn't premeditated. Jury'll sympathize -- dude was banging your wife, right?
Clyde, you wait here.  Glenn, got a minute?
Come now. Did you see the gun?
How can you remember that?
We had information bearing on Mr. Kim's desire to gain admission into the Joe Boys by assassinating a member of a rival gang.
You see that? You wanna be like that?
I don't venerate drug dealers, Roger. To the contrary.
Ten years is a long time.
What other case?
Shoulda told the one about Shu being the bastard child of Mother Theresa.
Eddie Dowd.
I've heard from the last ballistics expert on the list. It's an even ten who say Shu's gun killed Jimmy Chin!
-- Eddie...
You're carrying that around like it was a picture of your girlfriend!  I don't want to see your heart broken when this case crashes and burns!
But Roeder's dead. Ballistics says it's Shu! We don't have one witness -- unless we put Cecil Stipe on the stand...
They could've been brothers. It's why the eyewitnesses picked Shu.
How long did it take Badalato to drive Jimmy Chin's body from Chinatown to the morgue?
Do you speak Cantonese, Mandarin, or both?
Lemme guess. Some corporate V.P.'s banging his secretary over lunch and you have to focus your camera and plug in your little tape recorder.
A fucking wheelchair?
-- Find him?
No. You tell me, Shu.
Quite a bit you didn't tell me.
'lo, Cecil.
When the D.A. hears I filed the writ, he'll send someone here, maybe claiming to be a journalist. That person will ask you lots of questions. Just be truthful, Cecil, okay? To all of us?
My staff tells me it's been mostly drug pushers... I said that can't be the same Edward Dowd.
I'm sorry if I've ruined your day, Mr. Reynard. But my client's had a rough eight years behind bars and --
Friday's the drop-dead date on the offer.
You're pissing me off again, Ed.
Isn't it a fact that the "six other Asian men" in the line-up were all of the classic Mongoloid type, whereas Shu has the distinct facial bone structure of a Korean?
To the best of your recollection, were you sober when you performed the tests?
In those days, they often worked as a team.
I can't be expected to remember the name of every informant eight years after the fact.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
It's okay. It was always like that.
Then it was your idea to have Chuckie Roeder scare Eddie off the case?
A Cubano army, basically... inside and outside prisons.
"Name, rank and serial," Mr. Ortega. Let's not hide behind the Fifth.
Isn't it unusual for an Asian to be accepted into a Cuban prison gang?
I think what Eddie wants to say is --
What color hair will she have?
Go away. I am not talking to you.
That's not important. I will tell you what is important. The fan will soon be starting.
No.
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
Here he comes.
This isn't Mike.  Is this Mike?
Your behavior is not funny and is wasting the time of the Federal Government.
It's 4:30. We close at five.
What the hell is that thing doing out there? You're not taking that body anywhere.
Maybe not a thing, but maybe two things.
We got a phone, here, that's got a little ring.
You try that you little monkey.
Phillip?
QUICKLY MEN... WORD ASSOCIATION, COOP. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
It was a year ago today that Teresa Banks was killed. I'm wondering if the murderer will ever kill again.
He's dead -- good and dead.
No.
There was only one job. Teresa took the job. Her friend took a hike. Never saw her again.
So the sheriff had got an Uncle who's committed a serious crime.
A blue rose.
Why couldn't he have just told you all these things?
I see. He does talk loud.
I doubt it was drugs, more likely a problem with a nerve. I could recheck the arm for injuries, but for real nerve work we are going to have to take the body back to Portland.
Take a look at this.
I couldn't help but notice that you had a suspicion that Deputy Cliff was the murderer. You did think that, didn't you, Agent Desmond?
James called me last night looking for you.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
You know what your problem is?  You're just too adorable...
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Okay, L.  I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight.  No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
I'm in a mess today, too.  I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
Goodbye, Muffin.
You're not mad at me?
But I love you, Laura.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Did you make me a tape?
Baby, you know why? Cause it'll never get here.
That's right. She called me. She even asked me what your fathers looked like...
We're on our way, Baby.
Laura, do you love me?
You always hurt the ones you love.
Say anything you want... I know you love me and I love you.
You'd think so.
History is on our side, Ben. It's no accident that the great explorers were named Hennepin, Nicollet, Marquette.
Believe me, Josie, you would not offend the customs of this country. For instance, I don't eat fish eyes.
Can I take the car?
Laura.
You lied to me about those school books. I found them upstairs on your bed.
Laura, now I can't find that blue sweater. Did you take it again?
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Good night, Mom.
Dad.
Sit down... sit down... Are you hungry?
Who was that?
Did you get this from your lover?
Bobby didn't give you this?
Did Bobby give you that or is there someone new?
Oh, Leland, sit down and eat you dinner.
I don't know.
He was accused of jury tampering.
So what I want to do is stop it here. I'm going to make him an offer. I want to do it myself. I want it to come from me.
I know that answer. If we went to trial would we win?
Yes.
That was our insurance company's recommendation.
That's not my handwriting.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
Neurology?
...of Anesthesiology?
We've touched on this, his own witness has said...
Objection!
Objection! This is ri... expect us to accept a photocopy, we have the original right...
Anything special about the case?
Mary Rooney, the obstetrical nurse...
...You brought thirty years of medical experience to bear. Isn't that what you did?
...the Archdiocese called up, they said who was our attorney, 'cause the case is coming to trial...
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up. Who do you think you are?  Who do you think you are...?
Cardiac arrest. During delivery her heart stopped. When the heart stops the brain's deprived of oxygen. You get brain damage. That is why she's in the state she's in today.
Are you saying that a failure to restore the heartbeat within nine minutes in itself constitutes bad medical practice?
I'm sorry...?
Do you know who her doctors were?
Uh, why, why are you doing this?
Hi.
One hour.
I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it?  See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
That's it...?  Come on, guys... life is too short...  You tell me if you're playing 'chicken,' or you mean it.  Frank: I don't think I'm talking out of school, but I just heard someone offer you two hundred grand... and that's a lot of money... and if I may say, you haven't got the best of records.
What is it?
I had a witness disappear on me.
Do we have time this morning to...  All right. Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Listen to me, fella...
Maybe I can do something right.
I've got to work...
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it?  I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Continental Casualty...
I'm sorry, Sir, we're not allowed...
I can't guarantee that...
Hello, I'm calling from...
Pardon?
We find that your subscription lapsed...
He's the Assistant Chief of Anesthesiology, Massachusetts Commonwealth. He says your doctors, Towler and Marx, put my girl in the hospital for life. And we can prove that. What we don't know is why. What went on in there? In the O.R. That's what we'd like to know. Something went wrong. And you know what it was. They gave her the wrong anesthetic. What happened? The phone rang... someone got distracted... what?
You know what happened.
I can subpoena you, you know. I can get you up there on the stand.
Who put my client in the hospital for life.
I'm... Mrs. Doneghy? I'm Frank Galvin... why didn't you go in?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
Well, well, well. Huh?
...he's a good man...
You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance.
Right.
So what?
How are you holding up?
What are you doing in New York...?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...there are notations every thirty seconds...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
Brain damage could have been... it didn't necessarily take nine minutes, it could have been caused in two...
Yes.
That Frank was working on. Yeah. He thought Franky needed some help, so they bribed a juror. So Franky finds out. He comes to me in tears. He thinks that anybody who knows what a 'spinnaker' is got to be a saint. I told him 'Franky, wake up. These people are sharks. What do you think they got so rich from? Doing good?' He can't be comforted. He tells the boys at Stearns and Harrington they've disappointed him, he's going to the Judge to rat them out.
That explains why communication is cut the moment their machines begin to move.
Hey, you!  Better get outa here!
Hurry up!  Jump in!
Did you see it come down?
I'm sorry.  I don't smoke.
Aw, he isn't that good...!
Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up!  But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren.  I teach Library Science over at USC.
I almost forget when I ate last.  It looks so good.... You know, mostly I get my meals in coffee shops and restaurants.
No, on the campus.  I haven't any family.
A big family must be fun...I imagine it makes you feel you belong to something.
We'll get safely out of here, don't worry.
I stayed right by the door - praying for the one who loved me best to come and find me.  It was Uncle Matthew who found me.
He liked you ... I could bawl my head off!
How long was I out?
What was it like?
How'd you guess?
I probably wouldn't be able to get to them if I tried...
This Martian blood...  Let's make a quick analysis and see what we've got!
That probably dropped half way to Pomona!...What do you think?
What'll we say to 'em?
I thought he'd stopped doing horror.
Which means he's having nightmares again?
Sweetie, you've got lots of fans, we've done market studies.  You rate right up there.  We've already got Chase working on a prototype for the glove.
Dylan, it's breakfast.  Not arts and crafts  What?
No, you don't.
What if it isn't over?
Heather?
Someone's coming.
Rex saved me.
"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire.  'We will bake cookies first,' she said.  'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough.  Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."  Dylan, this is too violent.  I don't know why you like these stupid old tales.
He's on his way.
Dylan, you go back to sleep now.
In my bed.
You okay, champ?
Yes.  It's a story.  A story for a movie.
Must've read about the funeral.  Sick mother.  That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
You're not crazy, by the way.
Seemed, not was.
I've never mentioned it to him.
You got it.  What's happening?
You're right.  That sounds crazy!
I want to see the body.
I'll call the cops for you.  You've got the number on the fridge, right?
Captured?  How?
The way to stop him is to make another movie.  And I swear to you I'll stay at my computer and keep writing until I finish the script.  But when that time comes...  You're gonna have to make a choice.
Of course he is.  Freddy's dead and gone.
He would have loved this.
All his years at sea, he never stopped talking about these islands.
What?
What are they doing?
Oh I was walkin' down Lime street one day...
She said "None the better, you all go to hell..."
We'll bear off to port and run down wind.
Carry on.
But your instinct was to lose sail?
Okay, here's the duty.  Gieg, Weathers, Lapchick, Schucart: scrape and paint.  Corry and Stricklin have the brass.  Robinson, you're the Galley slave.  March you're on chain gang with Barnes. Johnston, solo on bilge detail.
There's still a way.
When we were growing up I always felt like you would take care of things, that everything would be okay.  But you can't make this okay, can you?
She isn't that old.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's right.  You wanna come in and shake it for me?
They were gonna put me into special- ed this year.  I stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. Shit, who am I kidding.  I'll never pass the boards.
You okay?
That we're going back.  I don't want it to end.  I don't want to be what I was when I left.
Who I am, outside of this boat. What the hell I'm doing here.
You gonna jump?  Or are you just having a last look?
Why then.
He does.
Why'd you do it?
Do you have your ticket?
Goodbye Mom.  I'll be okay.
What the hell is going on?
So... What happened?
Hold her steady into the wind. Southwest by west.
Remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.
Uh, huh.
Chicken is a fool's game captain.
But the Captain ordered you hard to starboard.
Is that what you were trained to do?
Your cable said you wouldn't be putting out until mid-October.
I'll be frank with you.  This was his mother's idea.  A romp through the Caribbean on a sailboat sounds more like a vacation than an education if you ask me.
Well, we thought we'd drop in and see if you were all still in one piece.
Humor me.  Eat it anyway.
Oh, really?
And being sixteen.
What's that?
Jesus.  She's got guns.
What's your problem?
Because I felt like it.  What do you care?
How would you know?
What?  Come on...
Why, man?
Tie it off!!
Do you have something to say?
No, sir.
What's it going to be?
We'd come twelve thousand miles together, through every kind of seas imaginable...
Yes.
Sorry, gentlemen. I'm 'most finished on my shoppin' here.
I'd just soon have a paper bag rather than a plastic one, if it's same to you.
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Need a hand?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
What'd you say?
Gas?
Club Zanzibar.
About. Where Lafitte crosses over Galvez Highway. State Road 86.
Hell, that rings a bell. Someone told me somebody lookin' like her was at the Nothin' Fancy yesterday.
It's none of my business, but when are you and Marietta gonna tie the knot? I always wondered why you never did.
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
But how are you finding New Orleans, Senor Farragut?
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Would you like to enjoy a martini with us?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
I still ain't sure what my daddy looks like.
Heard grandpa Santos and grandmama talkin'.
Hey baby...
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
Actin' funny how?
Sailor!
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
What's that, honey?
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
My God,  it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
I do.
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
You ready for this?
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
More'n likely.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
What's that, peanut?
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
It's a comfortin' idea.
Sailor?
Sailor? You know what?
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
So where'd you say you was?
Let's leave here.
I mean tomorrow.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
Six.
Wouldn't make any difference.
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Just tell me what you want.
Simple? Kill him? How?
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Explain it... I told you.
Where? In the leg?
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
What?...
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
Does that girlfriend of yours know that her mama and Santos killed her daddy?  Does she know her own daddy was one of the biggest drug dealers around - till he started snortin' the shit himself?...  Does she know you was around that night her daddy was set fire to?
I ain't heard of nothin'.
Hey, pal, you don't start doing crazy eights in the middle of the street none of this happens.
Actually... I just want to go home.
Hey. What are you guys doing here?
I like what you've done with it. When's Captain Nemo moving in?
You all right, Professor Tripp?
Oh, well, that's just it. She's been coming down here, every half hour or so, to, sort of, check on me. If I'm not here, she might... call the police or... something.
You snore.
It's the Chancellor.
I was explaining to Antonia how a book comes to be published. What you do as a writer, what I do as an editor...
You didn't actually purchase this car, did you. Trip??
Trip??
Left you...? Who? Emily?
No sexual confusion there, eh, Professor?
Not Curtis.
And now he's addicted to painkillers.
He lives with his mother.
Groom. Named Claudell. And his mother blames Vernon for his death.
Christ, Crabs, what do you expect me to do? The kid's practically in a coma.
Wait here. I'll be right back.
You stay there.
James? My James? What's happened?
Crabtree.
Let me get this straight. Jerry Nathan owes you money. So, as collateral, he gives you his car.
There's only one problem, Tripp. We don't know his real name. We just made it up. In fact, we made the whole guy up.
Came to my senses.
No. But I don't think that matters.
No...
It's cool, Jeff. Really.
I've been doing that a lot lately.
She told you about...
Look, Mr. Tripp. You have a drug problem, all right? On top of that, you have a bite on your ankle that is severely infected. We pumped you with antibiotics so you'll be fine, but another day or two and you might have lost the foot. As for your spells. I'm guessing they're a result of the anxiety you've been experiencing lately.
Let me get this straight. All that paper that went into the river. That was the only copy?
You cold, James?
Actually, I saw the greenhouse. So I thought... I thought I'd come out here and take a look at it. You don't see one of those every day. It looks like heaven...
They're glass. The buttons.
Can I ask you something about her?
Looks like... our old friend Mr. Codeine. That should take the pinch out of my ankle.  Have one.
Thank you.
Huh? Oh, no. This isn't Emily's. I just write in it.
The guy on the phone.
I think it's sort of writing itself at this point.
But... ?
How's that?
Outside Scranton.
This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again?
It feels really... good... here.
Yes you are. My stuff stinks. I know it. You said so yourself.
That's why you're having them. Your spells.
I'm not going, with them.
Get out of here.
Professor Tripp...?
So what are you going to do?
Actually, He's not the Chancellor's -- What?
The aunt, Hannah. Where did you take James that day?
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
I got the message you called.
And? Are you going to tell him?
Sara, my arm. I'm stuck, honey.
Not have it.
You heard? How?
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
What's he doing out there?
Sara.
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
And what do you think you might have said?
I went and looked at some babies just now.
Did you tell Walter?
Does he still love you?
Did you just make that up?
Listen, Antonia --
Who's this ?
I know it's you, Grady, I just... Christ, Grady, do you know what time it is?
Say, Professor Tripp, is all that stuff true about Errol Flynn? How he used to put coke on his dick. To make himself, you know, like, last longer?
Do you get high, Sam?
Holy shit. Are you serious?
Yes. He's a good kid. Maybe a little messed up.
I -- just wanted to see her, I guess -- Emily. And to see you too -- you and Irene. And to let everyone know that, even though it may be difficult to comprehend now, this -- everything that's happening -- it's not forever. It doesn't mean "Goodbye."
You look good, damn good, considering you're an old man now!
Hey, is that a school?
It's made from cherry. That's a hard wood.
She was going to throw it out, wasn't she? Just toss it like a scrap of wood.
Soon.
It's not what you think.
I get horny as hell for other women.  I mean I fantasize about raping some beautiful woman.
What are you looking at?
There's a million birds here.
Not too far.  Are you a bird-watcher too?
See anything interesting?
I would.
Doesn't everybody?
Your ivy. Too much direct sunlight. These plants don't like a lot of sun.
You don't want to know, but he's damaged goods -- real damaged goods, if you know what I mean.
What?
I know a place in the park where only very small birds go. There are no people or dogs or ugly crows and pigeons. It's quiet except for the song of these tiny sparrowlike birds. Would you like me to take you there?
Yes.
What's her name?
But will he... ?
That's right, you did.  Have you made any friends there?
You seem a little hostile today.
Why not?
Oh. It never crossed my mind.
Because if you did, I know a therapist named Ryan. I also know a therapist named Chung.
Do you think you're crazy?
Why do you think you're here?
I mean, when will I be normal.
Will I ever be normal?
I want to be normal!
Walter, we'll pick up here next time.
You're very late.
And what are you doing?
Did you get an erection?
What?
Doesn't it get noisy?
I'm not easily shocked.
Hey, that was... intense.
Tell me about it.
Did I say something wrong?
Is that all?
What's the worst thing you ever did?
You're not joking.
What was prison like?
You really believe that?
For men like me. They say most of us end up back... there. I'm saying there are risks... seeing me.
What's this?
What's going on?
This ain't no drill, slick.  Make me proud.
Nice shot, Lins.
Thanks.  How you feeling, big guy?
You never did like being called that, did you?
You need me.  Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do.  What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off?  What would have you done?
You wanna know what I think?
What are you still wearing that for?
I haven't worn mine in months.
What happened?
Fine.  Be that way.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here.  You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
I think it likes you.
Good hundred yards, I'd say.
Okay... okay.  We gotta get you out of here.
I know!  I know!  But we better come up with something.
Lindsey, just put the thing on and shut up--
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me.  Right?  So I got a plan...
Oh God, Lins... I--
Hi, tough guy.  I guess it worked, huh?
Just get around so your lights are on the hatch.
Lins, stay away from that guy.  I mean it.
Go to the infirmary... get the cart .. oxygen... de-fib kit... adrenaline in a... ten cc syringe... and some... heating blankets. You got all that?
He's convulsing!
Howdy, y'all.  Hey, Lindsey!  I'll be damned! You shouldn't be down here sweet thing, ya'll might run ya stockings.
I think they're from 'you know'.  Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure.  No light.
Quiet!  Quiet!
Get comfortable.  The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down.  The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
I want 'round-the-clock manning of the sonar shack and the exterior cameras.  We need early warning if the Soviet craft try another incursion.
He can't get to the door... I think he's going to try and take him himself.
High-Pressure Nervous Syndrome.  Muscle tremors, usually in the hands first.  Nausea, increased excitability, disorientation.
What kind of light?
Used to what?
And have you any other truths to tell me?
Up until now, Dad, I've been the one who hasn't wanted to marry him.
Allow me to inform you that my daughter is not a fugitive.
It's already two hours... What are we going to do?
Well?
Have you decided?
Find anything?
Yes, you should go.
Good. It's better if it were absurd. That would mean nothing much can be done about it.
Really, I've got to stop this business with Ettore... I would like to go back and start working on my own projects again. You know, I had many ideas...
Why are you looking at me like that?
Claudia, let's get married?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
I'm too sleepy.
But where did you finally end up?
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Please, you come too...
I'll stay here also.
Up until now those smugglers were operating only around the Palermo area. This will be a nice surprise for the Lieutenant in Milazzo... Call up headquarters. Bring them up to date and have them give you instructions on what to do with this crate.
And who is this?
Ettore...
Nothing, nothing  at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
The trouble with you is that nobody can speak to you, that's all.
Giulia...
Because there is no landscape as beautiful as a woman.
Oh, there are as many as one wants.
They tell me you have a lot of trouble at home. Is that right?
What other boat?
I work there but I'm really a stranger.
Just a moment ago... didn't you hear the sound of a motor?
Listen, Patrizia... The Marshal says there's a current that passes by here and ends up at another island... I don't know which... He wants to send one of his men over to have a look... One never knows... Do you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him?
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
Yes.
Because...
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
Why?
Should you see a doctor?
Uh huh.
Often?
I don't know.
Down... there.
I fell asleep.
What baby?
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Would you like some?
No questions.
You liked Sister Paul?
What else did she tell you?
How did she know that?
Agnes...
Did your mother see angels often?
Do you believe she really saw them?
Why not?
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
You can tell me.
She's dead isn't she?
What?
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Of telling you.
Why?
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
Of what?
She said Michael.
So I could go to him.
No...
I've been watching. We were fine 'till she came. She brought the devil here.  There was blood on her hand that night.
The longer you take to make a decision, the more difficult it will be for us.
The bishop is breathing down our necks.
Here you are. Don't let anyone know where you got them.
I don't know.
Thanks. 
No!
Hello, Mama  ... brought you something.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
Could there have been anyone else?
From other people!  I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
She didn't!  This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
Who?
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand!  She could have bled to death.
The Catholic Church...
She is not a child.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Visitors to the convent.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Oh, Dear God...
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.  And of course 
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
But how did it happen?
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
Who knew she was pregnant?
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
How fascinating. Do go on ...  ... John.
Gerron out of it, you're only jealous 'cause you're old.
You heard, it gets on my wick.
Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.
Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
Sure.
Would you like to be a little more precise, sir?
He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell ... It's 'cos I'm little.
I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
That's not your Grandfather.
Gerron.
What's up?
Eh, I don't know if you realise it, but ...
Yes. Your grandfather's stirred him up.
It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.
Go away! You've spoilt it.
I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
I see.  Do you like the play?
Thank you.
Oh, you're the understudy, sort of thing?
Well, the way you were spouting, like ....  "I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.
Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?
... all this and a jam butty too!!
Of course ... Look, if she was a Liverpool scrubber ...  Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it ... Y'what? ... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it ... so there!!
Yes.
And what's it all come to in the end?
Where are you off to?
What are they saying?
I'm soldier of the Republic, you'll need the mahogany truncheon for this boyo. A nation once again.
Come on let's get this coffee.
Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
Well, what are we waiting for?
Gie's a kiss!
What's he know?
Well, I got a few things to say to you, two-faced John McCartney.
Are you listening to me, Lennon?
No.
Now get on with it.
Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.
No, you look here, John. I've only one thing to say to you.
You are.
And my nose...
It'll only get you into trouble.
Temper! Temper!
Well!
Have <U>you</U> lost him?
Eh, where's my grandfather?
Well, you stick to that story, son.
Paul's grandfather.
Down the ... er ...
Yeah, down the ... er ...
He's out there somewhere, causing trouble just to upset me.
Oh no... this is a battle of nerves between John and me.
I'm adjusting the decibels on the inbalance.
How's that?
Eh. I thought you were looking after the old man.
Shove the gentleman jockey in the make-up room or something and keep your eye on him, will you?
I'll set John on you!
Oh, a little savage, is he?
Locked.
Engines off.
Are you in pain?
Dell, what's the last thing you can remember?
I'm sending.  Do you hear me?
I'll go first.
Just machinery.
What is it?
I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers?
What's wrong?
I have interrupted the course of the voyage.
What happened to the lights?
Where does that go?
Hurt!  How?
Well, uh... good luck.  I hope you won't need me, but if you do, I'm here.
Jay... how's it coming on the repairs?
And when will you be ready to do that?
Then why the hell are you sitting around here?
It looks completely different from the first one -- it's more like a worm with legs... and tentacles.
Hey, are you guys still there? What's going on?
There's some more combustible fuel down in the storage lockers next to the lounge.  I'll go get it.
All right... but do <u>not</u> go below decks.
Where did it come from?
That thing, God almighty, didn't you try to get it off him?
No, don't open the door.  We don't want it escaping.
Yes?
The machine will bring his temperature down.  His vital functions are strong.
While the rest of us wait down in the cooling unit with the net.
Can you get them back?
What?  What was that?
Oh no.
I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
What's happening up here?
This is horrible.
We can't kill it on board.  It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
If we don't hear from him soon, I think we better go in after him.
But what can we do?  He's out of radio contact.
That sounds a little fanciful...
They're getting pretty close now.
Men have waited centuries to contact another form of intelligent life in the universe.  This is an opportunity which may never come again.
This is Chaz speaking.  Sorry, but we are not home.  Our present location seems to be only halfway to Irth. Remain at your posts and stand by. That is all.
Atmospheric turbulence.  Dust storm.
10% argon, 85% nitrogen, 5% neon... and some trace elements.
Ten to the fourth dynes per square centimeter.
Still worried?
I understand why you did that.
We made it!  Damn, we made it!
Now what?
Hey, wait a minute!  That's all our food supplies in there!  We can't pump poison gas all over them!
This stuff's deadly -- I hope we know what we're doing.
Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
<u>Hey watch it</u>!
No good... it's eaten too much of me...
Can I... um... have some water?  Please?
Nada. No radiation... no movement... nothing.
Looks like a spore.  Fungus of some kind, maybe?
Nice howitzer you've got there.
We've got no option.  We're gonna have to get it off.
That's the second time I ran it, and it still reads the same.
How many of them are there?
I can't reach her.  Too much signal break-up.
MarsCo went belly-up on the Dow Jones.
Where're they headed?
When?
Picking up velocity.
Listen to what?
What?  Are you nuts?  Just the two of us?
Can't see a thing.  Are you sure?
Oh, man.  That's no glitch!
Secondary fluidic shunt for the sewage system.  I found the grating ripped right off.  The little fucker was strong.
Hey, Jan.  See if you can get someone to check out the chopper.
She was running a little sluggish on the way back.  Think the turbines might be playing up.
That's what we thought.
Already working on it.
They've changed their heading again.
It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind.
There's still time to back-out.
Okay, we're in business.
Hey, boss.  Wondered where you'd gotten to.
Four.
First light, we'll take a chopper out there and tell them to head back.
Yeah.  Somebody won.
Cornering it shouldn't be a problem.  Each part of this station is basically a self-sufficient deep-space transport module running off external couplers.  If we disconnect them and seal off every section, we've got a ceiling of about thirty-six hours on internal power.  That should give us ample time to find it.
That's the wrong way!
Hurry it up.
I can... feel it moving around inside me. You've got to kill me.
You have to...
Today's party's finished their sweep, the relief team's out there now. Everybody else is either asleep or running shift in the auto-shop.
'Bout five minutes.
Phoebe?
Let's have a minimum of pretending. I'll want to do a column about you-
I don't think that's funny.
Suites are for expense accounts. Aren't you being extravagant?
I know nothing about Lloyd and his loves - I leave those to Louisa May Alcott. But I do know you.
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great!  You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
You sat and talked until it was light...
What have you got to do with it?
Your name is not Eve Harrington. It is Gertrude Slescynski.
A matter of opinion. Granted. It is also true that you worked in a brewery. But life in the brewery was apparently not as dull as you pictured it. As a matter of fact, it got less and less dull - until you boss's wife had your boss followed by detectives!
That's not true!
And you realize - you agree how completely you belong to me?
Every now and then, some elder statesman of the Theater or cinema assures the public that actors and actresses are just plain folk. Ignoring the fact that their greatest attraction to the public is their complete lack of resemblance to normal human beings.
Let's go sit by the piano.
Claudia dear, come closer.  This is Max Fabian. He is a producer. Go do yourself some good.
Tell me this. Do they have auditions for television?
I'm giving her a very high-class party. It ain't like a rehearsal, she don't have to be late.
Margo? Lunching in public?
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
Just slipped your mind.
Bill didn't say - but Lloyd was beside himself. He listened to his play as if someone else had written it, he said, it sounded so fresh, so new, so full of meaning...
Bill...
Good luck, genius...
Forty-five minutes from now my plane takes off and how do I find you? Not ready yet, looking like a junk yard-
Only in some ways. You're prettier...
Oh well...  ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Bill...
You in a hurry?
Kid stuff or not, it doesn't happen every day, I want to heat it - and if you won't say it, you can sing it...
Many happy returns of the day...
She did...?
Yeah... I will.
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Well, we started talking, she wanted to know all about Hollywood, she seemed so interested...
So she seems.
Many of your guests have been wondering when they may be permitted to view the body. Where has it been laid out?
Addison-!
It's obvious you're not a woman.
It's not nonsense.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
But you may quote me as follows. Quote. Tonight Miss Margo Channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which I have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. Unquote.
To Margo. To my bride-to-be.
It's only for the license. There's a three-day wait - blood tests, things like that...
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
Yes, dear.
Often enough to keep the franchise.
Hello, what's your name?
Every day.
I'll admit I was worried when Max called. I had my doubts.
You think?
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint.  It's only a fur coat...
You need new girdles.
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect!  I want to apologize for Birdie's-
You don't like Eve, do you?
She works hard.
She's loyal and efficient-
You all put together?
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres-  Voila.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Who are you?
You probably won't believe me.
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you?  From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
That's the door.
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
You look just fine...  ... by the way. What's your name?
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
Karen...  ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
He can help you.
She knows enough not to be here.
It's been a real pleasure, Eve.
No, don't go...
That's my job.  See you at tea time...
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
How far to the station?
Do you want it on?
He's in love with you.
Why should he - and why should you?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
With tears?
How was the concert?
Lloyd, what happened...?
That's on time for Margo.
Lloyd, be careful...
But it can't be! We can't be out of gas! I filled it myself yesterday!  Wasn't it full when you drove to Brewster this morning?
- it's Addison, from start to finish, it drips with his brand of venom... taking advantage of a kid like that, twisting her words, making her say what he wanted her to say-
She's been to see me, as a matter of fact she left just before you came in - you just missed her...
What with taxes coming up - and since I'm a playwright and not an oil well operator - well, I've been thinking...
No, I got the idea myself - while she was talking to me...
- well? What happened?
You mean - all this time - she'd done nothing but apologize? What'd you say?
What's so funny?
I didn't think you would! It seems to me, Karen, that for some tine, now, you've been developing a deep unconcern for the feeling of human being in general-
Who's left out there?
How's the new one coming?
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
Spoken like an author.  Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh.  That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
She's your understudy.
I'm sure.
Hello..
That's right, but I don't understand-
"Liebestraum."
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
When's the audition?
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Anything to help you out, Max.
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
You get quick action, don't you?
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
--it was fine the way it was--
--and you've had some fucking meteoric rise, that's for sure--by the time you turn forty you might be the head of the Montana bureau--
--Bradlee went to Harvard--
Carl?
All right, what do we know?
Maybe a political operative of some sort--
You think they are confidential? I don't know anything about how this town works, I haven't lived here a year yet.
Goddamnit--
And?--And?--
Who's first?
I don't get it... this really was my turf...
Anything you've got.
And that something's got to be more than just Hunt, Liddy, and the five burglars--those indictments are gonna be bullshit when they come down. What else do we know?
We never reveal our sources, which is why you can talk to us.
I hate both parties.
Republican?
'68.
I  couldn't believe what she told me. Eight cups of coffee worth.
It goes very high--we've got to find out where--
--if we could name the guys got the reports, we'd be ahead again--
--I want you to shut up and listen to me--
That's what we've got to find out, but Segretti went to Southern Cal. and so did a bunch of Nixon men--
You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
I think that's him.
Well, we are trying to ruin his life.
How many fucking sources they think we got?--
You overslept?
You want Barker's phone stuff or his money stuff?
I never could figure just who this Dahlberg was.  Think it might be anything?
Sure. Him I liked, he was a very nice person. Secretive too, traveled all over, but a decent man.
Listen--we know you're involved in this--we're going to get the story, why not help?
By "they" you mean the White House, don't you?  Your buddy from USC, Dwight Chapin-- he works for the White House.
None of it was my idea, Carl--I didn't go looking for the job.
I don't know anything about Haldeman, except, Dwight's frightened of him-- everybody's frightened of him--Christ, I wish I'd never gotten messed around with this--all I wanna do is sit in the sun; sit, swim, see some girls.
Can't help you.
I'm the one sent you to Toronto, Bernstein--
You're a sex junkie, you know that, Carl?
It's awfully hot--  --and you haven't finished telling me about the money--
Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
Something maybe big.
But they both worked at the White House?
Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
Then it's our asses, isn't it?
Same kind of crap--
--I don't know, I don't know, it feels thin--
--well shit, we oughtta be tense-- we're about to accuse Mr. Haldeman who only happens to be the second most important man in America of conducting a criminal conspiracy from inside the White House--  --it would be nice if we were right--
I got Clawsen on hold--
We can't talk inside either?
Mr. Caddy? My name's Bob Woodward, I'm from the Post and I wanted to ask about how you happened to come on this case--
You thought I'd help out on specifics?  I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.  Are you guys really working?  How much?
Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in.  You come up with anything?
Follow the money. Always follow the money.
In my day, it was simply called the double cross. I believe the CIA refers to it as Mindfuck. In our context, it simply means infiltration of the Democrats.
Yes, the little ratfuckers are now running our government.
What?
And Justice and FBI know all this?
Where?
I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said "don't, don't" and I was frightened but I knew if I said no, I'd lose the whole fifth floor. So we published, and that night, after I'd told Ben to go ahead, I woke up in the darkness and I thought, "Oh my Lord, what am I doing to this newspaper?"  I woke up again last night with that same question.  Are we right on this story?
--you are ignoring the importance of the Dahlberg repercussions--
Mr. John Mitchell, the head of CREEP, says it means nothing.  "...This man and the other people involved were not operating on either our behalf or with our consent. These is no place in our campaign or in the electoral process for this type of activity, and we will not forget it or condone it."
What'd you get on W.House?
The second most powerful man is Robert Haldeman. Just below him are a trio: Mr. Erlichman is Haldeman's friend, and they protect the President from everybody which is why they are referred to as either The German Shepherds or the Berlin Wall. Mr. Mitchell we've already discussed. Mr. Colson is the President's special counsel.
Whaddya got, whaddya got?
You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
--which Young?
Mr. Sloan?
The report on the cash in Maurice Stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?
I can't say anything, I'm sorry. 
I'll do it.
Christ!  I didn't say you were out of the game!
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
Ah, Stifler's mom!  Thank you for letting us have a great party.
So...would you object if I said you're quite striking?
This is your plan, Finch?
This.  Right now.
Not bad, Chris.
Hey, what're you doing here?
Stifler told me.
Onions?
I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it...
I think I've had one.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
You think she was serious?
That's stupid.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
No, no that's fine.  So you doing okay?
Can I come in?
You're not...busy?
Dad.
What was your name again?
Whatever you want.
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
This'll do.
Oh yeah!  Put it in your mouth!
She's a <u>cartoon</u>, dude.
You guys got the Latin homework?
Ooh, here's an easy one:  "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
You can do that?
I still think you're okay.
You did it.
Yes.  No.  Yes.
Uh...
No, no, you must put your whole body into it.
Jim...
Did you see this?  This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
Oh, Kev.
Tonight?
Vicky, wait.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Hey...
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
Try the spicy tuna hand roll.
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
So does your tongue cramp up?
Wow.  You two really have something going, don't you?
Hah!  Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at <u>her</u> store.
I think you need your balls reattached.
What the fuck are you doing here?
Our last game is this Saturday.
You know.  If we hook up, tomorrow I'll just be some girl you go telling all your friends about.
Geez, I feel bad for him. Maybe we should've told him abou -
I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?
Salots! Shitfucker!
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Fan-fucking-tastic?
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?  My treat?  Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
Don't you want to change?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
This looks familiar...
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
What makes you so sure this will work?
I don't know...
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
Holy mother of God...
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
Pull over! Now!
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Claude...?
The ADM. Let's go.
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
Ha. Some wonder drug...
That's not all...  Marcel - Officer Boulard was following you.
I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
What?
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."  These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.  Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
Because Gaston was after it.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Merde.
You better follow that McDermott kid. He's going to wind up like his uncle if he's not careful.
Saint Severin...
I thought you were told not to tutor your servants anymore.
Where is your home, Anya?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
Is everyone all right?
We have to prepare you for an audience with Sophie.
People say Anastasia was the only member of the Royal Family to escape alive.  That makes her an orphan too 
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
I don't know.  I don't see what this has to do with me.
By pulling my hair?!
Just what do you think you're doing?!
Come on!
You must enjoy causing me pain!
I'm so scared...
Anya, wait!
Don't you, child?
What?
Hurry up with those papers.
Wake up, young lady, that's our train.
What do we do now?
So where will you go?
You're insane! You didn't kill the Romonovs - it was the...
Anastasia's music box... She had this all these years...  You could have found it...
Yeah, I do. It's for my girl friend. Make it out to Ralph.
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
We've been through this.
Yeah, Earl Warren?
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
Alvy, I...
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Well... thank you again.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Sylvia Plath.
Neat?
Uh, narcolepsy.
God bless.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay?
No.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
Those are the two categories...
You see, like you and I...
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
You- Do you love me?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
Yes, it is.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Yeah.
You're so sure about it.
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
I'm home!
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
What's- It's me, open up.
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired.  You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
Very big spider.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Okay, okay. Okay.
Happy birthday.
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my... 
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous.  If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
You look very pretty.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening.  So wanna get married or what?
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
What-
Where are you going?
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
I hope you don't mind that I took so long to finish.
without getting... well, let's put it this way...
Yes.
Charlie Chaplin.
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Just give me the license, please.
Ah.
Oh.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
How about a ginger ale?
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
There are no twos, Max.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
You fired the cleaning woman?
All right-so we can afford it.
Oh, I can imagine. P-p-probably the wife of an astronaut.
Heavy! Eaten by some squirrels.
Oh.
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
How long have you worked for the Therrians?
She's a constant surprise.
Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her.
Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend.  I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand...  You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess.  Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  "Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more..." And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film?
You don't have any clothes on.
What what's about?
Honey?
What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
What is that thing?
Let's get the kids.
He's gonna miss his flight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Directing suits you.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
So?
You need to call your dad.
And you know our friends, how?
Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero?
Just every once in a blue moon, you know.
We closed.
I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.
We'll be fine.
You're out of your mind.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Take your time, Jer.
What was it?  What the fuck was it?
I love you.  Most beautiful woman in the world.
What?
Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her.
You want me to uninvite her?
I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna.
In the kitchen.
Two minutes.
It's an unfair advantage.
I think we should all take it tonight. Everyone's staying, stays.  No driving. That's the rule.  I love you Sally-Mae. You're going to have a fabulous time.
Someone left the goddamn gate open.  Otis got out.  Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
Otis!!!!
Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
Who?  Who?  Who thinks that?
Cal, too?
I told you when we met I never wanted children.  I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it.  You weren't listening.
I'm a monster.  Exactly.
Pretty much a disaster, tonight, wasn't it?
I love gifts.  What did you guys get us?
The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead.
Yes, she is.
No.
Don't I find what?
Joking.
And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies?
Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe.
A little out of my element.
Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction.
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism...
The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
Easy tiger.
What am I, five?
Lemon or raspberry?
Yes.
Ryan.
I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila.
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog!
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Come on in.
The charades.
Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism.
Fuck you, Panes.
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Like the last time.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
Everyday.
So tell me, how's it going?
You're my best friend.
We're going to have to go back out there.
Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
Monica and Ryan.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
Oh my God!  America told me your neighbors are coming?
What do you mean, thank God?
Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
I don't have a drug problem.
Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Well, because he's more than a worker...he's a...what did he call it, Azteca...
So uh -- how come I haven't seen you around here before?
You dance...
That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
What <u>was</u> that thing?
I order you to find out where we are!
<u>Insectopia</u>?  You stupid worker, that's just a fairy tale!
My skin's dry, my exoskeleton is cracking...I wish I'd never met you, you ruined my life.
We're going to die!
And only you can become a Queen?
Why do they have you tied up here?
I felt the same way before I got married.  Confused.  Scared.
You new, kid?
So we're going back for more armor, right?  I mean, these guys are from outer space, how are we supposed to beat them?!
Don't be scared, kid.  Barbatus's got yer back.
No, no, you're...lookin' good. You've got good color in your cheeks.
Princess Bala, sir.  Your fiancee.
We know what makes an ant colony strong, don't we?  We know that no ant can be an individual.  No <u>single</u> ant matters, right?
Geez, and I forgot my toothbrush.
Affirmative.
Wow, what a spread -- you know, there's a food shortage in the rest of the colony.
...Not enough food?
Well I, I don't think "living it up" is the right term -- how about "working themselves to death"?
ARREST HIM!
General, the severe food shortage that faces the colony...<u>pains</u> me. The thought of any of my children going hungry...  Who's the cutest widdle worker?  You are!  Yes, you!  Don't forget to brush your teeth!  Ship 'er out.  What steps are you taking to remedy the situation?
I can't help it.  I have a thing about drinking from the anus of another creature.  Call me crazy.
Of course.  You were born two seconds after me.
Get real, Z!  She just dropped the scarf by accident!
It's a sign that you're crazy!  Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
I'm getting lonely.  Who are you talking to, anyway?
This the place?
So this is your mother's apartment?
Oh.  Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
You wouldn't have such a thing as a napkin, would you?
Beatnik! Go to my kitchen -- third drawer, under the good silver, there is napkins.
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Sure.
Eight-thirty.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
One more?
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order.  Shall we join the natives?
You all right? What's the matter?
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Here.
Your phone.
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
Something wrong with your legs?
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
You want me to move the television set in here?  You play gin rummy?
I don't want it.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Cut.
Why not?
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
Are you all right?
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner.  I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN  Why not?
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here --  -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
We're going to finish that gin game.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
Some weather we're having.  Must be from all the meshugass at Cape Canaveral.  You locked out of your apartment?
Oh, Mr. Baxter -- I'm glad you're here -- I was just going to get the passkey.
I thought I smelled gas coming from your apartment.
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
The Vice Squad?
Where is your apartment?
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
You know how people talk.
Oh, yes. Thanks.
So it was.  She threw it at me.
You're going to take her off my hands?
Yeah --
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
On account of me.
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
Mr. Sheldrake?
Let me worry about that.  Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
Want to tell me what happened?
Help yourself.
I'm not sure.
Yeah, wasn't I?
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
That so.
Family?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
You got a girl-friend?
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Yes, I know.
I don't know what you're talking about.
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I don't believe you.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
Remember what we talked about?
You didn't really believe me, did you?
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
I have that date -- remember?
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
What are you talking about?
Please, Sylvia!  It's a quarter to nine!
Did you have a nice Christmas?
Look -- you know the girls -- Thta's Terri -- she was playmate of --
Well I mean like they also took our fuel -- We've been here two days.
We need all our fuel anyway.
How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think --
No -- absolutely not --
You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together.
Two whole drums --
Winning the war by yourself.
That's good gin.
That's quite an array of ribbons...
I was an FO for the 25th.
Yeah -- typical A.R.V.N.
Chef -- is that 'cause you like mangoes an' stuff?
How?
And the grass?
Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time.
Can I go get those mangos now?
Smoke !
Yeah, Chef -- go ahead -- take Lance with you --
Get in there !
I --
Listen.
What cat  ?
I never heard about that.
Jesus -- that guy's too damn much.
You didn't like him.
Touchy.
Yeah.
Attacks repulsed, as I was saying.  This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise.  Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain.
Captain?
I guess this is whAt men of war do -- eh?
What's your name, sailor ?
You think that section on the point is ridable, Lance?
Mike, you know anything about the point at Vin Drip Drop?
Why the hell didn't you tell me about that place -- a good left.  There aren't any good left slides in this whole, shitty country. It's all goddamn beach break.
Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission.
What'd you do for supplies?
Seems to me he got himself fragged. i heard some grunt rolled a grenade in his tent. Maybe a rumor. Helluva man -- remarkable officer. Walter Kurtz woulda been a General some day. General of the Army. Shit, Head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Did you knew Kurtz?
I mean it's hairy -- they got some pretty heavy ordnance, boy -- I've lost a few recon ships in there now and again.
You talk like him. I don't mind taking casualties, Captain, but I like to keep my ratio ten to one in this unit -- ten Cong to one.
You were not coming here, to see me?
Do you know me?
I said get the fuck out !  I'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.  He's only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. He knows how to use a hypodermic.
You've gone crazy.
You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense.
My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife...  ... my death.
Love him... Yes, it is true. That's the hard part for me... I knew him better than anyone ... I knew him best.
I'll never get over it -- But I'll always remember him...
I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard --
Simple. They don't want him to go.
Right on -- he's been waiting for --
Are you warm, Captain?
I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta --
What show ?
Soldier -- where''s your C.O.?
20   CONTINUED:  
30   CONTINUED:
See the blood?  Pack of wolves took down a moose.  Greedy, gut-ripping sons of bitches.  I'd kill the last wolf on earth, right in front of the President of the U.S.  Stinking, cowardly predator, the wolf.
134  CONTINUED:
...I won't let a killer walk!
26   CONTINUED:
Watch it with Meyerling.  Man's as mean and corrupt as they get. Cut his mother's throat if it'd get him a couple votes.
How long have you been up north?
My dad was a Navy doctor.
Had?
What happened here?
Was there any trouble?
What's going on?
Surviving is what I know --
Next time you want to kill yourself, don't include me.
We'll stop here, dig out a snow shelter.
Be my guest.
Most dangerous thing in the world: A regular Joe, in over his head.  You trying to prove how tough you are for me, or for yourself?
Where in hell Meyerling dig you up?
Sure love to know where you fit in up here.
Have to get these wet things off.
Don't push me..!
Maybe...maybe not.  I'll tell you what scares me -- stumbling through life, like an ordinary jerk.  That's why I want to work on the front lines, where what I do means something.  Soon as I got here, I realized my job was bullshit.  Oil company propaganda.  I was ready to leave, then I thought screw it, I'll outsmart them, do the work anyway.  I don't know anymore.  Maybe I am fooling myself.  That's what I'm afraid of most of all.
Goddammit, I don't need this aggravation.  I'll shoot you, Ben.  Bank on it.
I'm not too old to knock the snot out of you!
Mr. Desmond!  Arthur Neff.  Area rep for the Federal Assistance Plan.  Tell the boys in DC to keep those goodies coming.
Not a damn thing.  What's going on?  Mr. Meyerling was here, all steamed up, looking for you.
Jiminy Christmas.  What do you want from me?
Bastards killed Sam, you think they won't kill the rest of us?
Alleged killer.
Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?  That's good.  Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
Wilder's missing church services; you believe it?
You're out of your greedy goddamn mind.
LeMalle.  We got a problem. Where's Mitchell?
It's a three-hour flight.  They shoulda got there yesterday.
I ain't gonna leave a seven- hundred-dollar Remington behind.
Thought that door was open last night...
Kenai's PA -- but how the fuck she seein' us?
...Ben never sent a signal.
Naah, Wilder knows we got friends in town.
Okay, let's backtrack, try to pick up his trail.  You know the kid out on the pipeline that Wilder's buddies with?
It's Sam Wilder!
Next plane's not coming 'til next Monday.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
C-o-n-s-c-i-e-n-c-e. I got Sean from the bakery to baby-sit so let's go out.
How was it talking to him?
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
Have they done blood tests on him?
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Sorry.
Uh, Udall?
I'm not kidding.
What's this?
Okay.
Lovely.
Nice of you... thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
Melvin, I'd rather not.
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
I'll never forget you said it.
I don't want to hear that music right now.
Hello.
That seems like a good choice.
Because...
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Well...
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Uh-huh...
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
I love you...  Let him take you home.
What the heck are those for?
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
I also regrew my beard...  but you're not interested in changes in me... so it's like I always told you...  when it comes to people you...
Hey, hey...  Haaa...  bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago...  the hand will come back...  they're sure...
You are very certain my dog is okay...  because you have no idea...
No touch. No touch. No touch.
How's Verdell doing?
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
Actually, I don't think so.
How you doing, great one?
The medical bill are 61 thousand now. I've spoken to your parents and they didn't hang up or anything -- they just said they would feel strange calling you.
Oh, is he dead?
Which color was that?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Yeeeess!!!
No...  actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
I carry bacon in my pocket.
Now we'll both call him.
I brought you Chinese soup.
Not it at all, really.
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
Good-bye.  Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Wait -- I want to see the painting.
Why are you doing this?
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm a waiter.
What?
Uh, Fontella's
Where you from?
What are you doing?
You can't --
Oh!  I got a question.  Jesus, this has been driving me crazy for years -- shit, listen to me.  I sound like some fucking fanboy.  I'm sorry, but I just got to ask you.  Everybody talks about how you left the Agency and got into the business and then how you went after the Russian, Nicholai Talinkov --
So what happens now?
You understand what's going on?  It makes sense, right?
Game over, bitch!
I'm on the scent.
Such language in front of a lady.
You're one of them, aren't you?  A fucking pro.
Now what?
Okay.  How did you find me?
Nikita?
He wants to kill you?
I don't need you to get the money -- my money!
Why?
Had?
Some people said that.  I never thought so.
Of course.  I was going to be James Bond.
It was... mechanical.  Very precise. It was exactly like the training drill except for the adrenaline.
No.  Just the first one.
Did it ever bother James Bond?
No.
Do you think about the game?
Not even a stalemate?
What will you do if this works, if we get the money?
What do you think he's doing?
He can't.  The bank has an expensive security system; metal detectors and X-ray machines.
If things go well, I don't have to. You'll already be in a rented car waiting for me.
Five million apiece.  You get on your plane, I get on mine.
I've been thinking about it for a long time.
What did he say?
You didn't take it.
Did you think they were newlyweds?
When I first saw them I thought they were married.
It was no big deal.  I saw them leave, I went in.
No?
I know.  It makes me crazy.
I don't know.  When I was in college, I was forced to go to a psychiatrist because I was caught drilling holes in my dorm room floor.
Because, I'll take it.
Attraction is a complication?
Is this becoming complicated?
Was nice.
I prefer it like this.
Would you like a drink?
You're very good at this aren't you?
But when you finLsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?
Do you think about their wives or their families?
Do you ever think about starting over?
Then, I'll sail alone.
Hey, do you mind if I talk a little?  I feel like, I don't know, talking I guess.
One hundred thousand?  That's it? Jesus... Is that a lot?
'Taken.'  That's nice.  When I had someone taken I would call our General Contractor, transfer the money and as soon as I hung up the phone I forgot about them.
Everyone handles it differently. Some are ready, some are not.
Some.
Can I ask you a question?
Why didn't you fade?
Yeah.
Look at that.  I haven't watched the sun set in a million years. Do you mind?
You wish to close this account today?
Excellent, senor.  If you could follow me?
Of course, senor.
Your a good guy Chris you deserve a nice girl.
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
Who's your friend?
I ain't sure poetry will go down too well here.
Okay, we're listening. But I'm with Katka on this one.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
Well, don't get carried away.
Really, "The Freeman Centre"?
Oh yeah, what's my connection to that?
Moved on to plumbing huh?
Like helping a sick kid?
Afternoon!
And a tram hit you?
You Romeo's sure pay a high price sometimes - anyone I know?
Couldn't keep your hands off the hired help, huh?
A fine specimen for conversion.
Chris, can you do me a favour?
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
I don't want to ruin your day.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
What about me?
Time for lunch I think. I'll get the sandwiches. What would you like Holly?
Sure, it's on the red metro line you....
It's that one isn't it.
Good morning.
Well, I'll try and get that clarified. As I understand it though, the charges include break and enter, theft, trespass, operating an unlicensed facility, vandalism and destruction of government documents - Whatever possessed you to start destroying people's medical records?
Well a plea of ignorance won't go far here. Frankly, I think you deserve everything that's coming.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
Doug you said you wouldn't be long. Come on, I've got to go. Now!
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
If you get out can we be together again.
But we could go to London and live in England.
No, I am an actor not a labourer, I am just warning you, that's all.
Yes, The Obelisk but it's closed for repairs.
No thanks, I must go, but maybe you could get some beers for the guys.
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
You mean it's started?
No act of love but willing violence demanded by one and begged by the other. As life turned to fantasy and reality to ecstasy a need, so deep no light could reach, surfaced like a nocturnal creature unearthed for momentary and glorious display. Left alone in a rose-tinted afterglow dimming fast she tasted the moisture of her body and wondered why light came to day and such desires to her pale-skin body.
I thought I'd help out.
Why are you doing all this, what for?
A champion of lost causes huh?
Shall I wash these out?
Is it dry?
I'd better get going, do you need a hand to get into bed?
Better than you.
Where did you steal the car?
Why did you break into that particular building?
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
What is it you want?
I'll need to make a phone call.
I don't want to go.
That's my bag.
It's more than what you're worth.
What are you an idiot!
Delay Mr Greenwell's departure until the disks have been located and you have notified me. Then, have one of your officers drive him home - I'll see to the rest.
She's coming over here...
That's one girl who can't take a hint.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
She's like some Puritan.
I don't make small talk --
Because, growing up, books were my world.
You don't know me.
'I hope your dreams come true.'
What's with the friggin numbers?
Looking for intelligent life?
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
He doesn't trust you.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
Oh. Just not at school...
Or anywhere where people might see us.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
Like fire.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Stand right here.
You make me feel...
What'd you tell your father?
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
What are you going to -- ?
Nope.
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
What are you thinking?
I'll talk to your father.
Did you give him a gift?
I'm asking how much.
I care for her.
It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now.
Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle.
Landon. We've lived with this for over a year now and --
Landon. You go on home.
You have materials for the side bearings?
You know about this stuff?
I thought she built it herself.
Now I can do what I want.
Show me some respect, you little asshole. It's Special Officer Tannen to you.
Listen you little Asshole, I oughta --
I don't get it. How come there's no rock 'n roll?
This is 1952....?
What's N.R.C.?
Hi, Marty.
Well, I was on my way to school, and I just wanted to stop by and see if you were feeling okay.  You seemed like you were in pretty bad shape the other night.
Hi, Marty!
Are you all right, Marty? You seem a little...nervous.
No, Chinese food is fine.
Oh, no! That was for the cafeteria! This is different!
Why what?
Yes, that's my name. Who are you, young man? Are you supposed to be here?
I'm sorry, there's no answer.
What, am I radioactive or something?
Professor Brown! It's almost eight thirty -- I'm outta here!
The power of a million hydrogen bombs!  ...and we get twenty four measly volts. It's not fair! I've been working on this power converter since 1949, and you'd think in all that time, I could find the right chemicals that would efficiently convert radiation into electric energy! But no! Thirty three years of dedication and research, and all I've got to show for it is a bootleg video operation!
Did you ever consider that some doors are locked for a reason?
Exactly two minutes difference...  and it's still ticking!
He will be. Simple inebriation, is all. The young man must have a rather low tolerance for alcohol... something that runs in the family. You see, he's a second cousin of mine on my mother's side. Came quite a distance to visit me, he added. His name's Lewis.
Professor. Well, not exactly, Professor. You see, we don't point it at the sun.
I told you not to interfere with any of the events of this time! Nobody's supposed to see you here! What if I was a mailman? Or a salesman?
Let me put it on a level you can understand. You don't belong here. You don't know anything about this world. You don't know the customs, you don't know how to talk, how to act -- you don't even look like you belong here. And if you walked out on the street, you wouldn't get 100 yards without being arrested. Then there would be questions, and where would we come up with the answers?
An atomic bomb.
Look, it's not a big deal! I can fix it! All I gotta do is get 'em together and make sure my old man asks her out!
In a manner of speaking, yes. And because of that, she's no longer interested in your father.
You didn't?
Now who's being stupid? The guy who runs this place.
Gone?... Where?
Oh yeah?
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
Catch!
What'd they look like?
Kit... Kit, I've got a question for you.
Holly's over here, Kit, if you want to see her.
Sure is pretty.
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
What's going to happen to Jack and me?
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
Nothing.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Why?
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Look at all this junk.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Yes.
I'd like to get out of here.
Have you got a better idea?
This your place?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Hi, whatcha doing?
Yes.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
So we'll help.  Let's get crackin'!
November 1, thirty days have September, April, June, and November...when short February's done, all the rest have thirty-one. October 31st!  Halloween!  Don't you get it?  Orson Welles!
Halloween. 1938..."War of the Worlds"...that fake radio news broadcast that got everybody scared, thinking that real live Martians were landing in Grover's Mill, New Jersey!  But then it all just turned out to be a hoax.
Ever since that phony phone call from the President.  Look at this. What is it?
Then what?
The professor and Dr. Emilio Lizardo were actually the first to discover the Eighth Dimension.  Almost fifty years ago.  Before Buckaroo's parents even knew each other.  But there was trouble, a rocket catapult failed and Dr. Lizardo got sucked half in, half out...when they hauled him back ,he wasn't the same guy.  His hair was orange...
We will, old fried, we will.
Planet 10?  The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy?  The invisible body?
It's Whorfin, Buckaroo.  Line 3.
What is this thing?  A fighter?
We're going down!  Onto the runway!
They're armed for bear, Buckaroo.  Check out those radiation levels.
Raise your hand...where?
Did you say..."Peggy"?
He offered you money?
Go away.  Let me rot?
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Never.
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
What? A black ship?  Where?  A black thermopod's been shot down ten miles back.
What's happening with my call to SAC?
What's his problem?
It's a spittin' image.
So where's Buckaroo?
Unscheduled surgery.  He'll be waltzing along momentarily.  What're you doing tonight?
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
I see.
Let him go.
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Okay, but that doesn't excuse his –
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
Ever talk to him?
...No. I never saw him with anyone else.
Look, maybe it's none of my business, but a man with your talent – don't you think your first obligation would be to your gift? Shouldn't you be doing whatever you have to do to work again?
...Huh? No, I'm –
Don't worry about it. It's just a B picture. I bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. Life is too short.
Getting STARTED! Christ Jesus! Started?!  You mean you don't have ANYthing?!
A souse!
I don't understand-
I can't write anything by tomorrow.
...I guess I'm sprouting off again. But I am certain of this, Garland: I'm capable of more good work. Maybe better work than I did in Choirs. It just doesn't seem to me that Los Angeles is the place to lead the life of mind.
...Look, they love you, kid – everybody does. You see Caven's review in the Herald?
Barton? What time is it? Are you all right?
...That's fine.
And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
That's okay, Charlie. I'm a playwright. My shows've only played New York. Last one got a hell of a write-up in the Herald. I guess that's why they wanted me here.
Caught me trying to be fancy! Yeah, that's it, Bart.
...I don't guess this means much to you.
And that's the point, that we all have stories. The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life – why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater?  Goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater.
...It was taken by one of my policy holders. They're more than just customers to me, Barton.  They really appreciate what I have to offer them. Ya see, her hubby was out of town at the time –
...This must be boring you.
...All right now, when I say "Ready... wrestle!"  you try and pin me, and I try and pin you. That's the whole game. Got it?
It's okay, it's okay.
I hope these are your shoes.
Because that would mean they gave you mine.
...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
And there's hope for you too, Charlie. Tomorrow I bet you sell a half-dozen policies.
Why don't we go to your room-
Hold on –
Hold on. Stop. Take a deep breath. Tell me what happened.
Jesus... They can tell that...
Yeah, but Charlie –
...Where did we put him?
...Well Bart, which is it? Orphan? Dame?
Mr. Lipnik, I really would feel much better if you could reconsider –
Sex?! He's a MAN! We WRESTLED!
Yeah, and I'm Buck Rogers.
Also known as Madman Mundt.
Started in Kansas City. Couple of housewives.
Doctor. Ear, nose and throat man,.
Good luck with no fuckin' head.
Hollywood precinct finds another stiff yesterday. Not too far from here. This one's better looking than the doc.
Sixth floor too high for you, Fink?
He teach you to do it?
...Maybe we should do a treatment.
Get down on your knees, you sonofabitch!  Get down on your knees and kiss this man's feet!
Okay.  I went after him.  I lost my temper.
Where were you tonight?
All night?
Yeah, I was drinking.
There's no smoking in this building.
How is your -- personal life?
You okay?
Catherine Tramell.
We were in some of the same classes.
Who?
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
What do you want, Nick?
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
Put your fucking hands up!  Don't move.
How long were you having sex with him?
Did you leave the club with him?
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
I told you -- I quit.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
But you didn't hurt --
Even though you were fucking him.
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
It was an accident.  They got in the line of fire.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
I didn't.
How exactly did you hear?
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
My wife used to call me that.
Why take the risk?
Did you think it was so special?
You shouldn't play this game.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
You won't believe me.
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
I have to do some research tomorrow.
No thanks.
A detective.  He falls for the wrong girl.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
What do we do now, Nick?
There is no smoking in this building, Ms. Tramell.
Did you ever engage in sado- masochistic activity with him?
Did you kill Mr. Boz, Ms. Tramell?
How did he die?
No suspects, no motive.  Unsolved.
Yeah, he said it was routine too. Now it's two guys saying it's routine.
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
Ain't that cute?  They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
How'd it go, son?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
You think I --
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
You all right, pop?  You want me to drive you?
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what.  You don't know what the hell was in it?
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
You look like dogshit.
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
I love it.  She's got a hundred million bucks.  She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars.  And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
So what do we do -- nothing?
What is all this "Nick" stuff -- Nick would you like a cigarette. Nick can you give me a ride.
Now what?
Come on, Phil.  You're not gonna let this slide.  What about her parents?  What about what else she's published?  At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
Beth?  Now you've got Beth killing people?
Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again.
You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way --
She's a suspect.
She's got enough money to burn this whole department down.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
Who are you?
My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you heard of me?
When's your show?
This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..
You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
It's in New York.
Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket.
Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery.
Yeah – I'd do that... You could teach me.
How come you're not peeing on them yourself?
Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.
You shouldn't have put it in the show. This is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.
Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage?
Yes, I understand – but where do you take them from?
I see..  And... How do you respond to being called – hmmm...  – yes, "the pickaninny of the art world."
Would you like to see the wine list?
I'm sorry, Mr. Basquiat.
Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.
You want me to put it here?
It's Maria Portos. What should we do?
I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday.  Here – I made this for you.
You got a date already?
Oh man! Folklore guy – worked on the railroad. Y'know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day they invented a machine to do it. And he says "Fuck that, I'm a MAN" and he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end, and he beats it by one spike.  Got a cigarette?
She's good.
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
You're back.
Which island of Hawaii do you want our house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?
... babies.
What's wrong with me?
Hi.
What's that?
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.  Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you're –
Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were –
I really... admire you.
I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different.
See you later.
No, I'd like the scarf.
Uh huhh... Band practice?  It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...?
Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts – you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett..
That one's for you.
You don't have any!!!
You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too.
YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.
Selina ... more facets than Vicki, huh?  Funny, but sort of mysterious...
Ah.  "Who", may I ask, are you going "as"?
Admiring your handiwork?
Well that's a ... long story ...
I don't see how ... Anyway, it's a treat to find you out in the world, away from Ebeneezer Shreck.
You're not coming to that, are you?  "The Relighting of the Tree" thing?
... and me.  No, that's be me and me.  Is that what I said?
I'm sure he's wonderful company and all, but ... doesn't the gold- plated bachelor bit get a little ... stale?
Well?  Was "Vicki" right?  About your difficulty with duality?
There's a big, comfy California King over in Bedding.  What say we ...
A kiss under the mistletoe. Mistletoe can be deadly, if you eat it ...
... What do we do?
No.  No glass on the inside.
If my life has had any meaning, that's the meaning.
Let's make a deal.  <u>Other</u> than my blood, what can I off--
Selina!  Selina Kyle!?  You're fired!  And Bruce -- Bruce Wayne! Why are you dressed up as Batman?
Appetite for destruction? Contempt for the czars of fashion? Wait don't tell me ... Naked sexual charisma?
Thanks.  Jeez.  Not used to this man-woman, cat-mouse business. Generally the babes flock to me, I tell 'em take a number.
Me, domesticated?  By you?  I doubt it!  You repulsive... awful... <u>penguin</u>.
You buy this "blurry" business?
Most of all, I want to find out who I am.  By finding my parents. Learning my "human" name.  Simple stuff that the good people of Gotham take for granted.
Don't look, Oswald.  It's a surprise.
I don't.  So, no.
Big giant <u>capacitor</u>.  And that, instead of generating power it'll sort of be --  -- <u>sucking</u> power, from Gotham City, and storing it ... stockpiling it, sort of?  Which, unless I'm being dense, is a novel approach, I'd say.
How long has it been, Uncle Alfred?
You certainly will not.
I guess they don't have fax machines on elephants.
It's good to see you again, Uncle. I've missed you.
I came to give you your freedom, a chance to live the life you choose. The same gift you gave me.
He's over-eager, impulsive.  I can't trust him not to get hurt.
You have?
Well, I hope you'll stay with us.
I am as well as can be expected.
I love you, old man.
It's good to see you.
This is to replace the bike I lost. I'll get you the rest.
Servants, Masters, it's  ridiculous. Alfred is the sweetest, most noble man alive and he's subjugated all his life and dreams to someone else.
Paying someone to prepare your meals and do your laundry and clean your dishes, you call that family?
Nice suit.  And today you are?
She's definitely part of this.  It's weird, for a while Ivy was all I could think about.  But then...
Umm-hmmmm.
Why is she so desperate to kiss us? I'm betting her lips are poison.
We gotta get those locks changed.
Winded, old timer?
What can I do for you, Doctor?  A research grant?  A hospital wing?
We cut our support.  A conflict of ideologies.  Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.
And?
You're not even listening to me.
Julie, I'm not the marrying kind. There are things about me you wouldn't understand.
Who's Ivy?
What happened to his wife?
Absolutely.  Just as soon as you take ten hours training in the simulator.
Of course.  Alfred still keeps your mother's picture in his room.
Like hell you do.
Hail the all-knowing Bruce Wayne. Here's what I know, she loves me, Not you and it's driving you crazy. It's why you stopped us from kissing. Because if you can't have her, nobody can.
One question.  When Batgirl and I rolled off the telescope, how come you didn't try and save us? It was the first time I fell and you weren't there to catch me.
Let me guess, Plant Girl? Vine Lady? Ms. Moss?
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals.  Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe.  The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them.  For we will be the only two people left in the world.
What say we turn up the heat?
How about dangerous curves?
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal.  These lips can be murder.
...Would it be a terrible imposition to ask you to take better care of your equipment?
It's happening again. Just like my parents. A monster comes out of the night. A scream. Two gunshots. I killed them.
Letters in the alphabet.
What now sir?
Up here, Al.
...dual personalities. Abnormal psychology. Washington's poster child for the criminally insane. I read your work.
I wish I could say my interest in you was purely professional...
A girl cannot live by psychoses alone.
Welcome to my parlor said the Riddler to the Bat. How's tricks?
Death.  Death. Without taste, sound and all around us.  Because there is no way for me to save them or myself. This is one giant death trap.
Mr...?
Um...I'm pretty sure I'm Bruce Wayne. And you are?
Call my secretary, she'll set something up.  Factory looks great, folks.  Keep up the good work.
How can I help you, Mr. Wayne?
Patient apparently suffers from acute obsessional syndrome with potential homicidal styles. Work better for you?
That kid is amazing.
Me? I'm easy. Especially after a couple of martinis.
Why do you do that?
And the beast slouches towards Bethelem.
There's something I want to talk with you about. It's...Well, we.. I...
We don't kill. Killing is what damns you. It-. What am I talking about? This conversation is over. You're going away to school.
You can't-.
But what about all the good we can do? There are monsters out there. Gotham needs us.
Who is The Batman, Edward?
Yo. Charlie. Gimmie an order of brain deep-fry. Extra well done. Hold the neurons.  Patient exhibits symptoms of psycho neural overload. Notation: obviously higher settings can be dangerous to the subject.  Riddle me this, Fred. What is everything to someone and nothing to everyone else? Your mind of course. And now mine pumps with the power of yours.  New from Brain-bok. Da pump. Think faster. Reason higher. Out-cog-nate every homey on the court of life. Da pump. Yeah.  Ho! Mark. I sense an odd penchant for the anagramatic. The acrostic. The crypto-graphic. What doth this bode? Answer me Marcutio, you little runt.  Fred, I must confess you were a wonderful appetizer. Simply divine. But now I yearn for a meal of substance. The main course. A wide and varied palette. Ah, to taste the mind of a hero. A nobleman. A poet.  A chick in a short skirt wouldn't be so bad either.
...or death.
How'd you find us?
Harvey. You need me. Since you've gotten out of Arkham, you've managed, what? To bungle stealing a safe? Wreck a statue? And, correct me if I'm wrong here, but weren't you outsmarted by an acned acrobat at the circus?
Holy shit.
Where are you sending Batboy this time?
How high up would you say that is?
I know the feeling. It won't last.  He's a long way ahead of where I was at his age.
How long's it been, Alfred? A quarter of a century?  It seems like yesterday. I guess we ended up doing more harm than good.
GET IN THE CAR!!
Look! Police!
What about the girl?
How much do you weigh?
Thank you, Vicki.
How'd you find this place?
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost.  Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
That's how it is, chum. One column - and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets for good.
No.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
God.  You would.  Come on, Bruce.  I just want to get two drinks in you.  As an experiment.
Who's this 'Bruce'? Are you trying to make me jealous?
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We --  -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
Got it all figured, huh?  Grissom just sits back and hands you the reins.  -- Maybe he don't know what we know.
I dunno, man.  After what happened to Johnny Gobs - -
My brother's a priest, man.
Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in?
God, Vick, a girl could get hurt doing this.
Small so far.  I think he's leaving the big fish for Harvey Dent.
No.
Man, I feel like Robin Leach.  You actually know all these people?
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent.  They would know.
Vicki. We got a wealthy millionaire here... who dresses up like a bat. He goes out at night and swings around -- in his cape -- on a rope.  CRAZY BAT-STARD!
Jennifer can stay and look after Kevin
And what did you say?
I'm not sure I got the right person but they were a bit busy ...
I know you are.  Very serious ... most of the time these days.
Here, let me do that.
Goodnight Annie.
David.  There's a call for you.  It's your wife.
Better go.  Grierson hates people being late.
Seems to be a problem with the door. Where's the picture gone?
Oh yes.
It wasn't a dream, was it.  I have to go in to work and tell them Whistler's Mother now looks like Danny De Vito.
It's very good Bernie.
And howls Alison?
Saw her at the movies the other night with that boss of hers.  Nice guy.  Good looking.
Lord Walton assures me this guy's one of the very top scholars in the English art world.  Has a couple of doctorates no less.
So, why not haul your ...  nice little ass into this room and explain to me and my wife why our precious daughter is going to be absolutely fine because of all the fantastic intelligence and attention you are going to give her case.
Oh, look, I mean, it's kind of the last thing... I mean, I'd really like to, but... things at home are kind of sensitive, so I couldn't really er ...
The thing is, sir, I've just been giving the painting a very thorough inspection, with the help of Dr Bean here - and we feel the time's come for Whistler's Mum to have her first face-lift.
Well, congratulations.  Isn't that great, David?
All the guys they claim are English to and good-looking like Dan Day- Lewis and Liam Neeson, turn out to be Irish.  Even Anthony Hopkins is welsh.  Prince Charles is so ugly they pay him two million bucks a year to stay indoors.
As you can see, security's pretty tight in this section.  Nobody gets past Elmer here.  Isn't that right?
He was incredible.  This guy is fearless.  He has no fear.
Well, there is that ...
We need you urgently in C Theatre.
off the peg?
I wish I could use that at school.  "Hey, Teach, no hard feelings ... It's just things between us ain't what they used to be and I need a little space, ya know?  So I'11 see you around in a couple of years, maybe".
Come on Sting!
Huh huh huh. That was cool.
We're gonna get paid to score.
Wait, I wanted her to do it.
Hey Butt-Head, why's that guy holding a sign?
Beavis. This is what it's all about.
So, uh, huh huh. Are we gonna score now?
No way butt-hole! I want the window.
This is dumb, let's find that chick.
Check it out Butt-Head, TV!
Ow! Cut it out Butt-Head.
Whoa, my life is cool!
Hey Butt-Head it's that chick!
Yeah, heh heh. Umm, isn't Seattle in Washington? Heh heh... 'cuz I was thinking maybe we could go see Hole.
Shut up, dill-hole.
Um... ass... head...
You already said that, Butt-Head.
Beavis.
Yeah, heh heh. I think I just had an accident. Heh heh hmm heh hmm heh.
Hey, Butt-Head, it's that slut from the plane!
You must bow down to the Almighty Bunghole.  Heh heh, this is cool.  Bungholio-o-o-o-o-o!
We got nothing, Chief. We tore the place apart. We can only legally hold her for another couple of hours.
Did you give him a full cavity search?
We just cleared all four floors. No sign of him.
OK, nobody shoot. He could still have the unit on him. Keep your distance. We don't wanna take a chance on hitting it.
Whoa, this kicks ass! Huh huh huh.
Uh, hey. One of you kids got a match?
You scored with two chicks?!
There are a thousand things... Why did you disappear when you walked off the front porch?  Is this a punishment?  Are we halfway to heaven or are we halfway to hell? And how long is this going to <u>last</u>?
Oh, Adam, don't ever leave me alone.
That's it?  No number, or instructions?
There's nothing we can do.  It's just a matter of time before they unlock this room.  There goes my model.  There goes our last refuge.
My God, we're back where we started.
Lydia's trying, but they don't believe her.
Did you copy these gravestones right, Adam?
But <u>we</u> let him out.
Ah, Adam, you don't know anything about little girls.  She's just... missed out on some love, that's all...
<u>You</u> did this?  You carved all these little figures and houses and things?
You tell them that we are desperate horrible ghoulish creatures who will stop at nothing to get back our house.
Nine months?  What difference does that make?
I heard.  Tore your face right off!  Bad news.  It obviously doesn't do any good to pull your heads off in front of people if they can't see you.
Just get some people out of our house.
Just one daughter.
I don't like Charles Deetz particularly, but you could have <u>killed</u> him.
The whorehouse was my idea. I want Betelgeuse out of the picture!  We've got some serious talking to do.
He said if I let him out he would take me over to the other side to find you.
You could double the size of your hardware store!  You'll be rich.
Oh, honey... I didn't mean anything ... it's just too big for you two. I know these things.
Mr. and Mrs. Maitland?  I've come for the last time.  Where are you?  Barb...
Well, yes, of course.  It's great over here.  You'll meet all the greats.  James Dean.  Buddy Holly.  'The little things a you say and do... make me want to be with you-a-hoo.'
I can't help you from this side, but here's how we do it.  So <u>simple</u>.  Say my name three times. That's all.  I'll be all yours. Then I'll bring you over here in style.
Your name is <u>Beetle Juice</u>?  Yecch! That's as bad as <u>Deee</u>lia <u>Deee</u>tz.
No I don't.  I don't take orders from smurfs.
They'd look silly on me.  I'm fourteen years old!
It's <u>Otho</u>!
Otho knows as much about the supernatural as he knows about interior decoration.
Lydia, relax.  We'll build you a darkroom in the basement.
Yeah, maybe if he's nice, he'll let me hang myself from a rope in his barn.
Skeleton keys never work.  Anyway, this can wait.  We'll get a crowbar later.  Your mother...
Well this is... I mean, this is the weirdest --
Look at all that <u>parking</u>!
Now, let's get back to business. I want to get Maxie Dean and Sarah up here immediately.  I can make history here!  I'm going to turn this sleepy little backward town into a leading supernatural research center... and amusement park.
I'll bring the wine... and the business plan.  And Lydia you'll bring the ghosts.
They're... not here anymore.
Are they suffering?
I plan to have a stroke from the amount of MSG that's in this food.
Don't you <u>dare</u>.
What do you think?
<u>Oh my God</u>!
'I' will tell you what is boring.  Once you cover up the wallpaper, knock down a few walls, alter the traffic patterns, and -- perhaps -- only perhaps -- think about an inground pool -- the place <u>might</u> just be livable.  What's on the third floor?
I have a feeling there's some very interesting space behind this door.
Is this the key to the attic?
Are we going to be seeing you at Miss Shannon's Boarding School?
It's bad luck.  And I believe hugely in luck.
Otho, that's terrible.
Wait a minute!  What am I worried about?  Otho, you can't even change a tire!
Their wedding clothes.
You can pull your trousers up, now.
An attorney?
Oh, I see...  ... Well, then... You're a very funny man, Mr. Gardiner. You caught me off guard, I must admit...
Good, keep your weight off that leg, Mr. Gardiner. In fact, it would be best if you could stay here for a day or two, if that would be would be possible. Since Benjamin became ill we have our own hospital downstairs. I can promise you the finest in care, unless, of course, you would prefer to go elsewhere.
... And please call me Robert.
... Benjamin has been hounding me to allow him to address the annual meeting of his Financial Institute today, but obviously, the strain would be impossible... How about here, Chauncey, any soreness?
... Oh.  ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
Eve is going to stay. The house will not be closed.
Yes. I love Eve very much.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
Some pain is to be expected...  ... And I think what would be best for the two of you is a good night's rest.  ... It's late, I'm afraid it's time for my patients to prepare for bed.
Good God, Eve - you'll freeze out here.
Not necessary, but preferable. I don't think he'll be a bother, he seems like a most refreshing sort of man.
How true. Mr. Gardiner may be a welcome change of pace.
... Do you think we should look for him?
Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.
Gentlemen, I didn't call you here at such an hour to make accusations, I just want to explore the possibilities. Now, I have three questions; Is the man a foreign agent? Or, have we suddenly found that our methods of gathering data are grossly inefficient? Or, thirdly, have the man's files been destroyed? Now, I'd like some answers.
I don't think that's entirely true, Grover.
Well, Mr. President... They don't quite know what to think.
A Black man gave me the message.
Mr. Gardiner, I have a telephone call for you. Sidney Courtney, the financial editor of the Washington Post.
Of course. They would like you to appear on the show tonight. The Vice President was scheduled, but he had to cancel, and they asked if you would be interested.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer...  ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Chauncey...
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
I know you are, Chauncey...  ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
I'm sorry to disturb you, Mr. Gardiner, I know you must be very busy.
... Are you sure you like it?
I'm sorry we haven't met sooner, Mr. Gardiner. I had the pleasure of seeing you on television last night and I listened with great interest to your down-to-earth philosophy. I'm not surprised that it was so quickly endorsed by the President.  ... Tell me, Mr. Gardiner, just how serious is Benjamin's illness? I did not want to upset Mrs. Rand by discussing it in detail.
And I have noticed in you a certain reticence regarding political issues - so why not a coming together? An interchange of opinion? We may find, my friend, that we are not so far from each other, not so far!
Yes. Tell me, Mr. Gardiner - do you by any chance enjoy Krylov's fables? I ask this because there is something... there is something Krylovian about you.
I feel very good in here.
Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
Bravo!
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength...  Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
Tell Eve? You mean Mrs. Rand?
... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
How about taxes, Mr. Chance, surely you must have paid taxes?
Might you have a birth certificate, Mr. Chance?
I am allowed to go to the attic and select any of the Old Man's suits. They all fit me very well. I can also take his shirts, shoes and coats.
This is terrible, sir -  I hope you're not badly injured...
I don't think we should call anyone just yet, it may not even be all that serious.
How long do we stay in here?
... Evening, Chance.
... I see.
I'm sorry to say that our time is running short, but before we close, I'd like to ask one final question. What sort of gardener, sir, would you be?
Hello, Thomas... I'm Chance, the gardener.
... We're with Franklin, Jennings and Roberts, the law firm handling the estate.
Your lunch? You have a luncheon appointment here?
... You've quite a sense of humor, Mr. Chance - but all kidding aside, may I ask just what you are doing here?
Mr. Chance, perhaps you could show us some identification with your address -- a Driver's License, a credit card, checkbook?
Mr. Chance, that was twenty-seven years ago.
... We shall need some proof of your having resided here, Mr. Chance.
Correct.
... Sid, be reasonable - I've been everywhere, there's no place left to check!
You heard?
... Ben, really...
I shall take the gentleman to the third floor guest suite, ma'am. Dr. Allenby is standing by.
Come on, Eve. Let's let the men talk, there are so many people that have been asking about you.
... Is it me? Is there something I've done?
... Would you take me on a tour?
... Yeah...
No! He's a real gardener!
... Business, bullshit! Going out in the middle of the night to meet that bitch in a bar...
What do you mean there is nothing? That's impossible.
Hmmm... Take this down.  I want this quote included in the Tass coverage; 'Chauncey Gardiner, in an intimate discussion with Ambassador Skrapinov, noted that "Unless the leaders of the opposing political systems move the chairs on which they sit closer to each other, all of their seats will be pulled from under them by rapid social and political changes."'
Kaufman, I'm going to need information on Mr. Chauncey Gardiner's background.
And put it through on a Code Red - I want it as soon as possible.
I do not want Benjamin Rand disturbed! You have other ways of gathering information than to trouble a dying man. Use whatever agencies are necessary to put together a detailed history of Chauncey Gardiner, if you run into problems, alert Honeycutt.  I'll be in the office at seven in the morning and I would like to have it at that time.  I've got to take a leak.
This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that.
... So what does all that add up to?
You have proven that already, Comrade Skrapinov, you are to be congratulated for recognizing the importance of this man and establishing an early friendship.
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
... Well?
Well, Ben... I...
Hello, I'm here about the ad.
When you say, I can be somebody else, what do you mean exactly?
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Seven-ish
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
So how was it? What was he doing?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
My God!
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Welcome to LesterCorp. May we meet your filing needs?
Pardon?
You're not like the other boys we've had here. Granted, I can't understand what you're saying either, but your soft palette resonates tremendously well and you never ever constrict your epiglottis.
No. I understand perfectly.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz.  Ma'am
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
Moving story.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Why not?
Who told you?
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
That's the usual?
Hi.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Really?  But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
You're late.
I've fallen in love.
Lotte, this is so good...
Lotte? Is that you?
So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
No. Don't be an ass.
Vegas? What'd you think?
What kind of circumstances?
Do tell. I love a good plan.
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Do you dream often?
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
You don't look a day over one hundred and five, Captain. What's your secret?
But now we've lost access to Craig.
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show.
You still there, sweets?
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
Bad dream, darling?
Yeah what?!
Captain Mertin?
You still know.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
DID YOU COME FROM THE OTHER SIDE.
I had another dream last night.  The dead man laying on top of me and I had nothing to eat. And the ghosts without skin stuck their fingers in me and said Beloved in the dark and bitch in the light..
You gave me the bad dreams. You left me behind...
I want somethin' sweet.
Well, good luck with the job.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Yes?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Morning.
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
True.
Why's that necessary all of a sudden?
What run him off? Tell me that!
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
Oh yeah. Oh that's load off. I thought everybody gone crazy.
You remember your price, Stamp?
They'll know. They'll know as soon as they born. Cause it's inside us,Stamp. It'll be inside them. We'll pass it down. Schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..
I was there Paul D...There in the yard. When she did it.
Stamp, leave off I said! I knew her when she was a girl. She scares me and I knew her when she was a girl...
You shaved.
Aw, girl. Don't cry...Me and you, we got more yesterday than anybody. We need some kind of tomorrow...
I'm looking for a gal name of Judy. Works over by the slaughterhouse. Said she lived on Plank Road.
Yeah, yeah I know. Okay.
Pin your diapers on, Lebowski.  Jackie Treehorn wants to see you.
Well, enjoy, and perhaps we'll see you again some time, Dude.
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier once we get instructions for the money.
That had not occurred to us, Dude.
Hey, man, I'm not--
Jesus fucking Christ.
Okay.  Vee take ze money you haf on you und vee call it eefen.
Excuse me?
Yeah, well, what do you care, Walter?
Sheesh.
Where you going, Dude?
Almost five!
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?
Kill that poor woman.
Fucking Germans.  Nothing changes. Fucking Nazis.
--So he says, "My son can't hold a job, my daughter's married to a fuckin' loser, and I got a rash on my ass so bad I can't hardly siddown. But you know me.  I can't complain."
Jesus, man, can you change the station?
Please, feel free to inspect them.
That's a Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever award, which is given--not necessarily given every year!  Given only when there's a worthy, somebody especially--
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.  And this picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation, yes, yes? Not of California.
They're not his, heh-heh, they're not literally his children; they're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, inner-city children of promise but without the--
One--oh!  Heh-heh.  You never went to college?
...Me, I don't drink coffee.  But it's nice when they offer.
White Russian, thanks.  How's the smut business, Jackie?
No!  No!  NO!  THAT'S NOT--
Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man!
Francis Donnelly.  Pleased to meet you.
"Johnson"?
Huh?
You mean coitus?
Lord.  You can imagine where it goes from here.
Shit yeah, the achievers.
Do you have any news regarding my father's money?
And please don't call her my mother.
Well...yeah--
Well, no, not exactly.  It's a complicated case, Maude.  Lotta ins. Lotta outs.  And a lotta strands to keep in my head, man.  Lotta strands in old Duder's--
And then. . . let's see, I uh--music business briefly.
Increases?
I'm saying, Cynthia's Pomeranian. I'm looking after it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.
Anyway.  How much they offer you?
...They  gave  Dude  a  beeper,  so whenever these guys call--
I figure it's easy money, it's all pretty harmless.  I mean she probably kidnapped herself.
The fucking point is--
The what?
Walter--what the fuck are you thinking?
We're screwed now!  We don't get shit and they're gonna kill her! We're fucked, Walter!
...Huh?
Walter!
No, Walter!  I said I thought she kidnapped herself!  You're the one who's so fucking certain--
But Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand- off!  They didn't get, the fucking money and they're gonna-- they're gonna--
You don't know, Walter?  You seem to know the answer to everything else!
You want a toe?  I can get you a toe, believe me.  There are ways, Dude.  You don't wanna know about it, believe me.
I'll  get  you  a  toe by  this afternoon--with nail  polish. These fucking amateurs.   They send us a toe, we're  supposed to  shit our- selves with fear.  Jesus Christ. My point is--
That makes me feel all warm inside.
They're nihilists.
What're you, a fucking park ranger now?
He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-and-Out Burger--
Uh-huh.
I mean we totally fucked it up, man. We fucked up his pay-off.  And got the kidnappers all pissed off, and the big Lebowski yelled at me a lot, but he didn't do anything.  Huh?
His million bucks was never in it, man!  There was no money in that briefcase!  He was hoping they'd kill her!  You throw out a ringer for a ringer!
AS IF WE WOULD EVER DREAM OF TAKING YOUR BULLSHIT MONEY!
It's all over, man!  We call your fucking bluff!
Oh, shit.
Fuck you.  Fuck the three of you.
What's mine is mine.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING MONEY, SHITHEAD!
Huh?  No, she, she hit me right here.
Well sir, it's this rug I have, really tied the room together-
Well, she's back.  No thanks to you.
Bullshit. Walter!
I'm not--
Seems like he's doing me a favor, then.
how long since he was bitten?
No hemoglobin left. Their metabolisms are too fast.  They burn out.  That's why they're having to feed so often.  Their systems are self destructing.
I've never seen anything like this.  The Reapers are as different from us as we are from you.  It's almost as if the virus is re-wiring their bodies, creating new, parasitic organs which consume the old ones.
Because one of us is going to kill the other before this ends.
Get real.  I was useful to Damaskinos as long as the hunt was still on.  Now that it's over, all bets are off.
What do you want me to do?
You came back for me.
What do you think?
What do you really think?
Where were you, Whistler?
Eau de suckhead.  Tasty.
Come on, Blade.  Talk to me!
And so will we.
The genetic material you spliced into Nomak --  Where did you get it?
You got something in mind, Blade?
Nomak?
I would hate to think you were losing your perspective.  Who do you think God favors in the web?  The spider or the fly?
Any casualties?
You worry too much, Stevens.  I have assurance from our friend inside that events are unfolding as scripted.
Gave it a more aggressive exhaust profile ramping.
You're wasting your time, already been tried.
I had to increase the dose. You're building up a resistance to the serum --
Get in. You’re leaving.
Why not? The future of our race runs through your bloodstream. You've got the best of both worlds, Blade. All of our strengths and none of our weaknesses.
No longer.
You shouldn't be here.
I can't just leave. I have a life here, a career --
But, he could've --
But he's a policeman --
That's a glyph, kind of like a vampire cattle brand. That means Officer Friendly here is someone's property. Any of the other vampire's try to bleed him, they'll have to answer to Friendly's owner --  This glyph belongs to Deacon Frost. We've been tracking him for a while now --
Look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance I could turn into one of them, then I've got no choice, do I? I have to work with you. I need to learn everything I can about them. It's the only way I'll be able to find a cure for myself.
What are you looking at?
I can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.
I do. I remember from day one. People staring at me, sensing I was different. Watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts I wasn't human.
My mother used to say that a cold heart is a dead heart.
Get out of here --
How's it going, Kam?
This isn't human blood.
I thought you promised to give me some distance?
Five minutes, not a second more. And I don't want to hear a word about "us".
I see. And what would you have us do with this "half-breed"?
These archives are restricted to members of the House of Erebus.
You're wasting your time, Frost. Far greater scholars than you have tried to decipher these words. Whatever secrets they hold have been lost.
You're a monster.
What -- ?
So what do you use, then? A stake?
Blade's unique, you know. A one in a billion anomaly. He can withstand sunlight, garlic, even silver. But he still has the Thirst.
Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who <u>cares</u>?
What do you mean?
No.
--Jamie Kurth, Jonathan Edmunds--
Domini?
Just trying to set the mood for the mission--get the "feeling."
Yeah, so?
You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
Druid Hill Park.
--the witch kills children--
Cheery little place.
No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--
--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
--now c'mon!
We'll stay overnight, get a hotel--
Nothing. I dunno--
Oh, Jesus, no--
I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
Beer and weed is what I've got.
From-the-movie-Mary-Brown, Trailer Park Bible Psycho?
If you're looking at me, look elsewhere.
No fucking.
We should be so lucky.
Where <u>is</u> it?
Where's Domini?
--into the <u>Black</u> <u>Hills</u> with--200- something miles from here--
Who?
--Cotter--
They're making "Blair Witch II," too.
Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
Well, she's got to be <u>somewhere</u> here.
Why was <u>she</u> exempted, Nick?
She got <u>paid</u>.
Pointless.
Someone want to tell me what's going on--
What?
The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
Domini's the only logical explanation.
She's far from "fine."
"It's why the witch kills children."
--yes--
--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
Your mother's pastor.
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
...Ray?
What was that?
Why d'you wanna leave all this?
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
On the phone. Was it for you?
...Well I'll be damned.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
...What?
Well... what happened?
...Where is everything?
...So?
If he does come in I'm not here... What were you drinking, Debra?
You want to hustle me. I don't want to be hustled. It's as simple as that. Now that I've communicated, why don't you leave?
And how many room got TV, Dusty?
What night is it?
I told you. I like you.
Sign.
Ray. Did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?
...Anything else?
I'm supposed to do a murder--two murders--and just trust you not to go simple on me and do something stupid. I mean real stupid. Now why should I trust you?
...What?
Something I got to ask you, Marty. I've been very very careful. Have you been very very careful?
No, he's off tonight. Where was he last night?
What's this?
Got a problem, Meurice?
...Why?
...and Abby. Maybe. But as far as I'm concerned that only leaves one fucking possibility.
Where was I?
What day is it today, Angie?
I think it's important not to get depressed. Depression is a terrible thing. They say it can bring on illness.
I don't want to talk about it. Everything's okay now. I don't want to talk about it.
Suave. goddam are you suave, you fucker. You want some beer?
To your health, Frank.
See you Tuesday, Frank.
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont - I live near you. I believe you know my father, Tom Beaumont - Beaumont's Hardware Store?
Detective Williams here. yeah. Tell him to go to Sergeant Milton. yeah, copy.  Well, Jeffrey, you found something which is very interesting to us. Very interesting. I know you must be curious to know more.  But. I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you not only not to tell anyone about your find, but also not to ask more about the case. One day. when it's all sewed up, I'll let you know all the details. Right now, though. I can't.
I guess you've seen some bad things.
What is this? What color is it?
Okay?
And that man came out with a third man - this well-dressed guy. here's the photo. I think a girl named Dorothy Vallens is in trouble with these people. I think Frank has taken her husband and her son.
For now. Alright. you better be. And Sandy better not be involved with this, I can tell you. Be prepared to come in for further interrogation on this later.
Yes it's me!!! Frank is on his way up to Dorothy's apartment.  Oh no. Frank has a radio and is hearing everything we say!!  Detective Williams. hurry. I'm in the apartment. hurry. I'm hiding in the back bedroom.
Not yet.
Who's this fuck?
Can I feel 'em?
Bull.
He's comin' back?. What for?
He's the reformed dealer though who wanted to turn himself in. he's the one that caused Frank to come and Frank's fucking us real good. I just feel so horny. I'm supposed to be here watching you why can't I be here fucking you. Listen. I know his cock's the size of a pin - let me give you the real thing. let me wet my whistle, baby.
That oughta do it.
Jeffrey. Jeffrey what?
Yes.
Do you like me?
Maybe you don't know. I know you though. You're Jeffrey Beaumont and I know where you live and I know ways to get you and I know ways to kill you.
Nice guy.  Who's he?
I can't. I can't. You think you know so much.
Look.
Who is Don?
I came back to help you. You said do I let girls sneak into my house. You know where I live. if you need to. come to where I live. O.K.?
Come in.
Yes. Frank-
Do you like my body?
I want you to hurt me.
Shut up.
Wait a minute. Wait. Whatiya want? For cryin' out loud!
You called me Jeffrey.
Yes.
Where have you been?  Oh God. they hurt him, Jeffrey. Jeffrey, Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me. HOLD ME. Oh God.
Shh. I'll tell you.
Hold me, Don.
We're going to leave that up to Detective Williams. I'll tell you though. you're okay. you shot a real son of a bitch.
Don't be a good neighbor to her or I'm gonna send you a love letter. straight from my heart, fucker. You know what a love letter is? It's a bullet. straight from my gun, fucker. Once you get a love letter from me, you're fucked forever. Understand, Fuck?
Oh yeah?
I'm home from school. My father's in the hospital.
Come on. you brought it up. Do you know anything?
The ear is from a missing person maybe?
I guess you have to get back home soon?
I have to help out in my father's hardware store. they're giving me sort of my own hours for a while. which is nice.
What happened to him?
I guess so. Like you said. It's a strange world.
I guess Mike's got some sort of sports practice in the afternoon.
You said it was a strange world. and you're the strangest part of it. Are you crazy.she is possibly involved in murder. This gives me the creeps.
Now, how are you going to do that?
I'll tell Mike I'm sick. There's a game tonight anyway and he'll never miss me. Afterwards he can go out with the guys. Just so the record is kept straight though, I love Mike. What do want me to do?
I already know. The "Slow Club." It's on Route 7.
What's the plan.
Brilliant.
I'd like an ice-cold Heineken.
Okay. thanks.
Well, how did it go?. What happened?
You want a Dairy Queen?
You want to tell me about it?
Wow. Should you tell my father?
You're sure right. It is a strange world.
So are you.  I mean you're a neat guy. We better get back.
Shoot.
Number two. I saw the Yellow Man come out. This time with a well-dressed man with an alligator briefcase. They drove down this factory building and stood on a staircase looking at something in the distance. Number three. now get this. In the distance was a murder. a drug dealer shot to death and a woman with her legs broken.
Okay.
It's good to see you.
NO.
Oh my God. What's wrong?
Take her to my house. My dad can get an ambulance faster than anyone. Do you have anything to put around her?
I should go with her, Sandy.
... Sandy?.
Please get to your father and send him and the police to Dorothy's apartment right away. Be sure your father comes. Something is happening over there. They're hurting someone. the guy she loves. Tell them to hurry. I'm going over right now.
Look Jeffrey.
Looks like they've got you strapped in pretty good.
Are you feeling okay?
Good to see you, son.
How ya doin' Dad?
Well. Okay.
No.
Well.
Hey, you ivy league shit. COME HERE!
I just wanted to ask him a few questions, that's all. Maybe I better go.
It's a real good chocolate cake. Duncan Hines' devil's food. real good.
What are watchin' this junk for?
Sandy?. Could I talk to you a minute?
Greetings, Mr. George.
On the plane.
Pleased to meet you finally, George.  I am Augusto Oliveras.
Yes.  Jack Stevens is already a very busy man.  Along with many others.  You shouldn't stay away so long.
I'm so glad you two could make it. Mirtha, look at you.  So beautiful.  You look like you're about to burst.
Nothing like this back home.
This is it for me.
Are you sure this guy is cool?
Should we buy it?
Promise me that we'll never be like them.  I don't want to wind up like that.
George, I went to the doctor.  I don't have two years.
Excuse me?
Not so fast.  I would like to go over the details.
Hmm.  I see.  Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
Whose cloths?  Your clothes?
I demand to know everything.  I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
Mirtha.
What the fuck is that?
The way we figure it, Barbara flies to Boston twice a week.  Two bags per flight.  Twenty-five pounds in each bag.
Come on, George, no one is going to pay that.
I don't think so.
Half a million for you.  Half a million for me.  One-point-three five for the Colombians.
It's nothing personal, George.  Just business.
I lost sight of everything.  Forgot who my friends were.
Your offense?  Why are you here?
What do you got there, Diego?
Twenty-six months.
I've got to get out of here, Diego.
Yes, you have a dream.  And maybe you accomplish your dream.  But yet you failed.  Why?
George?  What do you know about cocaine?
Oh my G-d.
I know.
George.
There's no room.
Nothing.  Todo esta bien.
Estoy bien, okay?  Everything is alright.  There's no problem.  Okay? This never happened.  No one has to know anything about this.  Diego, I want you to calmly tell them where the fucking coke is.  Do it now.
Derek Foreal.
You'd better kill me now, Diego, because you're a dead man.
He's in tachycardia.  George, your heart is racing.  Have you been using drugs?
Cocaine?  How much?
Yeah, layaway.
Surprised to see me?
Thank you.  Have you been getting the money I sent you?
Mirtha comes from a very wealthy family.
So, this is the man who takes fifty kilos and makes them disappear in one day?
Un rata - no good.  But he could have run, fled the country.  Gone to the policia.  But then his wife, his children, his parents, his friends, many people would die.
I like you, George.  You are loyal. That is good.  That is rare.  Maybe crazy.  Yes.  I can tell already.  You are like me.  I look at you and I see myself.  It's in the eyes, no, George?
So, you are wanting to sell the cocaine for me in your country, George?
Freedom.
George, you look terrible.
Please.  Sit down.  We'll drink some scotch.
It is very difficult.  Diego makes me a lot of money.  If Diego goes so does the money.  You were an excellent teacher, George.  When the student has learned well, the teacher is no longer necessary.  We must remember we have wives, friends, familia.  Even familia that has not been born.  But sometimes, we must forget as well.  I am like you. I must teach the lesson.  We want to teach the lesson.  But we cannot.  We must remember that life is the teacher.
I'm sorry, George.
There's something out there for me, Dad. Something different.  Something free form, you know?  Something for me, and college just isn't it.
I know.
What are you going to do?
Just low.
Yeah, Dad.  I really did.  What am I gonna do?
I know.  I'm great at what I do, Dad.  I mean, I'm really great.
No, it's good.  You have a family.  It's good if it makes you happy.  It's nice to have nice things.  Are you happy, son?
Give it to her, Dad.  It'll make her happy.
...you sonofabitch.  Putting on George's boots.
I guess I kind of lost sight of things. "May the wind always be at your back and the sun always upon your face, and the winds of destiny carry you aloft to dance with the stars."  Love, George.
You hear about your old friend, Diego?
Look what the cat dragged in.
I don't know.  My name is George.
Look, Mirtha.  She's walking.
Hey, why don't you just put a "I'm doing cocaine" sign on the car.  What is your fucking problem?
I haven't seen one dollar from you.  You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
Yeah?  I better see some money out of it.
Yeah.
I don't know.
California?  You can go anywhere in the world.  India.  Tibet.  Australia. Paris.  And you choose California?
I swear.  On my life.
I fucked up.
Mr. Jung, can you describe the circumstances of how you began talking about cocaine with Mr. Delgado?
You're looking at him.  We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go.  You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment.  You assume all the bust risks.  We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further.  If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
Ramon tells me you are looking for some mota.
Well, I'll tell you.  I was walking down the beach, minding my business, when who did I see but this fucking guy.  I didn't know you guys were living in California.
I'm on vacation.  On my way back to school.
Not that far, only halfway.  You sure you know what you're doing?
But the NLF has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...
In Indochina, <U>they</U> won.
The law is often inconvenient, colonel ...
Which "district" do you belong to?
Third group. What's your assignment?
With an unloaded pistol?
I don't do that kind of thing.
Why? Isn't he sleeping here?
Go away!
To show them to the UN, right?
Where were we?
Good, thank you, Corbiere... . See you tomorrow.
Mathieu! Mathieu, a name ...
What is she saying?
How you doin' Mister D?
I don't think that this is the time, or the place.
So she knew about his heart?
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of death?
Then how did it get into his body?
Your Honor, the State enters this evidence as exhibit A.  Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?
What would be the effect if someone secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make love?
Objection, Your Honor.
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
Why would she want that?
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
Did you use it the night Marsh died?
Mr. Marsh's Cardiologist and his nurse have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least two occasions.
What about Miss Lawson?
Why not?
When you say your sexual relations with Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors.  I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
What did she do next, Mr. Roston?
Did you suggest any?
-- And what did you suggest?
Well -- as I remember it, we had an argument.
Yes.
You can suggest anything you want. It happened.
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
How do you know that?
Yes -- he mentioned it.
I suppose.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
Dristan nasal spray.
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
I'm not asking for names or specifics.  I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
Yes.
Do you think I did it?
Frank!
Can we get out of here?
Hello?
Hi, Frank.
Yeah.
Sorry.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Yes -- it would be nice.
You and me -- making love.
I called you all weekend.  Where were you?
What are you going you doing?
You killed him -- didn't you?
You killed him.  You killed him -- and I got you off.
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends?  How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
I love you.
Because I'm expecting a call.
Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
Really.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye.  That was Sattler.  He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson.  He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
Humped
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Working.  Charlie and I were going over some statements.
I don't know.
It's more involved than that.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
Did Marsh use it?
How bizarre!
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
Lawyer here?
What?!
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
What are you doing?
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Nobody did.
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
My niece had "the changes" when she was thirty-one.
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
He's very... clean.
I better go. You sure you're all right?  It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Help cook?
Why did you stop?
Do you miss it?
I'm sorry. That was...
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
You really don't need anyone?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
It's Robert.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
Are you comfortable?  Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
Yes.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
What do you want me to say?
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
Mrs. Johnson! Mrs. Johnson! Is it true Cary Grant has proposed to you?
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Okay.
About an hour ago.
Your mother left explicit instructions that she wished to be cremated.
We can't go back there.  Are you crazy? You saw --
Hey, watcha doing with that dog?
Take my advice.  And shoot that dog.  Or let me.
Oh yeah, I guess this would be that space that was so perfect for a recording studio.
...Bones ol' Bones so mean and bad, whupped his mamma, shot his dad.
You want us to move in here?
Tia ain't a chick.  She's family.  And don't forget it.
Where's the others?
Where's the gangsta of love?
Don't poison your mind with that ghetto paranoia.  That's all just ways of people justifying their own failure.
You tell my old friend Mackie, I'll be seeing him.  Soon.  Real soon.
Yeah, we used to do the after-school b ball at Kenwood.  What it is?
I ain't interested.  And if you gonna sell it, don't sell it round here.
Jimmy, you've got --
I want you to do something for me, baby.
But.
Trust me, Jimmy, there's big money behind this.  Not just big.  BIG.  Like big business big.  Big corporation big.  Big government big.  Our little acre alone'll net hundreds a thousands.  Nothing but net.
One simple word, three little letters. Yes.  That's all it's gonna take and we could move out of this dump, get the real deal.  Big houses, legit business...
What will it take?  What do you want? Just tell me, Jimmy!
I'm sorry, Momma.  Maybe next time.
It's alright, baby.
Like what?  I got a little power, sure. A touch of the shining, a little of the sight.  But no more than you do.  We're not witches.  I can't wiggle my nose or say a magic word and make him go away. Besides, maybe they deserve it.  Maybe we all do.
We'll have to sneak in.
Are they on the radio?
Why couldn't you just tell him to let us in?
I'm here.
Patrick, he's...
We're here.  Where the hell are you?
You got the cash?
Let me see it.
I saw your face.  You knew that place. You knew those people.
Please...help me...
No way man...
Not your style.  Is it Eddie?  Killing off your customers?
Fair enough for the shit.  But I think a little bonus is due for knocking out the competition.
I know it.  The old slaughterhouse.  Hey, Sal.  That little weasel we popped today?  He's got something for us.  I knew he would once he thought about it.
That you stole off those white boys was down here last night?  Are you crazy? Everybody from hell to breakfast heard that screamin' on Blackstone last night!
And damp, too.  Let's not forget damp.
I thought you were bringing the Colonel?
Not really to live, just to play.
Boy, put that thing down.  You can't take that.  Might be evidence.
Shit!  Damn dog.  We gonna have to do something about you.
Glenlivet, right, Gino?
So Caesar, what did it total out at?
Open the case!
How the fuck can I open it?
Caesar?  What is this?
Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit!
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
They just left, didn't they?
It's impossible!
Violet, please!
Where is the money?
Stupid cunt!
Don't try to tell me what to do.
What did she do to you?
I saved you.
Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
I'm going to ask you where the money is.  Every time you don't give me an answer, I'm going to cut off one finger.
Yeah?
Mick, I know it's late, but there is a problem.  They haven't shown up yet.
No.  I don't know where they are.  I even called over at Johnnie's, but no answer.
Is that the money?
Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks.
Ma'am, you have to open the door.
This is a beautiful place.
Who?
Oh, I'm sorry --
Yeah.
Thank you so much.  You have to let me pay you something --
No.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
What's wrong?
Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
Because it's the truth.
I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
I don't.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
You said he washed the money?
What happened?
What time did you say they would be there?
Where will you be?
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment.  Everyone will think I did it.
It's me.
I was so afraid you ...
How'd it go?
Done.  We go now.
Johnnie, what did I say?
Mickey?  What are you doing here?
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
Storm clouds are gathering, Ted. It looks like rain and I don't have a thing to wear.
Yes.
She's a gypsy.  If it's a cover, it's a great one.
-- he went inside! --
Forget it.
So now you know.
Keep it. 
Did you bring investment advice for me tonight?  It was tax shelters, wasn't it?  Swiss debenture-swaps.
You're a U.S. Citizen?
Well, either you are, or you aren't.
His brother.  You know his brother?
Well...  I must admit, when my assistant told me you were here I was, really -- I was quite -- I was surprised.
Was it the break-in?
Jesus...
And I don't get hurt.  I get twenty thousand dollars and I don't get hurt.
What if I say no?
Sounds like you were in an accident or something.
Lots of people have guns.  You're American.  Americans love guns.
We're about an hour away.
Okay, so...
Look, you could come up.  Or you could wait if you want.  I could go check it out.  You could wait.
Marie, just --  -- just stay there! -- just --
He's dead isn't he?
What is that?
xxxxxx
xxxxxx
What about you?
Yes.
It's an angle of the street -- some sort of alleyway -- you can just...
-- but it was <u>him</u> --
You're on a boat.  A fishing boat. Italian flag.  We're out of Vietri.  It's the cold that saved you.  The water.  The wounds are clean.  I'm not a doctor, but the wounds, it looks okay.  It's clean.
You drink rum?
It's not much, but it should get you to Switzerland.
...ervices.
...Be back.
...ixed itself.
What have you got there?
We know everything here. This is the Storeroom of Knowledge.
And the cost of it all, Deputy Minister? Seven percent of the gross national produce ...
I know he would have wanted me to help you ... And I promised your mother I'd take you onto the team at information Retrieval. But I gather that ...
I'm not a terrorist! You must know that! I'm not guilty! Get me out of here!
You are late.
Triplets.
Sorry about that ... Mr Helpmann told me you were coming aboard - congratulations!
How much do you know?
There are some real bastards in this department who don't mind breaking a few eggs to make an omelette, but thank God there are the new boys like me who want to maintain decent civilized standards of terrorist eradication. We've got the upper hand for the moment, but they're waiting for us to slip up, and a little slip- up like this is just the chance they're looking for.
What's she done?
Right. Er, you're not going to keep calling her Barbara, are you?
Then we'd better keep this business just between the two of us.
Thanks, Jack. I'll be in touch.
Trust me.
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
You think these are tits don't you?
Don't litter my cab!
Yes, of course. Sorry.
What's going on here?
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Security.
Shit! The house is on fire!
This is a hell of a time to buy a nightie.
Please, Jill ... I love you.
I'm going to pull some strings. It's our only hope.
What do you think? ... is it me?
Oh my God, a mistake!
But if they did promote you
Try next of kin.
Problem. She doesn't have a bank account.
Oh God! I think I've broken a bone. What a pathetic thing I am.
That's it.
Can I forget it?
You don't happen to know how I can get around an IRQ/3 do you?
I know that.
What! Shit!
Lime, I need to use your computer
My mother said it would be all right.
Hello, Spiro. Merry Christmas.
Numero une, crevettes à la mayonaaise. 
What were we saying?
Actually, Alma, that's one of the little things I was dying to tell you ... Sam's been promoted to Information Retrieval.
Sam ... you haven't had dessert.
Is Mr Helpmann here?
My husband's dead, isn't he?
Uh ...
Here we are! I'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.
Ah ... hello, Mrs Terrain. SAM lets go of the parcel and pushes JILL away. She moves off.
Yes, but. I've got to have a heating engineer
My name is Sam Lowry. I have to report to Mr Warren.
Er, don't you want to search me?
My I.D. cards.
But I could be anybody.
And you can't tell me what the proper channels are, because that's classified information?
A steak, please. Rare.  Mother, I need to ...
Now look what you've done to him.
What the - ? How did you - ?
Sign here please.
The pace?
Well I suppose one has to expect a certain amount
Can you fix it?
What do they want you or?
Thank you very much. How much will it...?
What am I going to to do with this guy?  Pierce, I was just on the phone with Borough Command. Out of twelve shifts this month, you've been late for nine, sick four and that includes the shift where you came late and went home early.
Nobody tells me to fire anyone. I told them: shove it up the big one.  Sorry.  I said, you want to fire him, come over and do it yourself.
You're late, Pierce. I know, but I can't fire you. I've got nobody to work sixteen XRay with Walls.
No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
It's okay, Kanita. Come on in.
Frank Pierce.
She wanted something to help her sleep.
That shit is poison, Frank. We don't drink alcohol here. What you need is one of these.
So, Frank, am I going to live?
Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
All right, all right, he's been snorting that Red Death stuff. Been going for four days.
IB Bangin.
What the hell.  The next year, tiebreaker for the division, in Boston, Yanks down two to nothing, Bucky Dent steps to the plate.
He's very very sick.
I wouldn't do that.  The doctor seems to think he's suffering from some rare disorder.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
You shouldn't smoke.
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
Sleeping.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
Excuse me. You seemed like you were in trouble.
Don't seem so bad to me.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Mary. Mary, we've got to get going.
Who is it?
Nobody gets fired. Look at me. Only thing they might do is transfer you to the Bronx. You look like you aged ten years since I rode with you last.
No, you never listened. I was going, man, if someone on high hadn't pulled me in. I had put all I had into saving this dumbass lowlife suicidal that when he went down, there was a part of me that wanted to go with him.
Who's that?
Went over to Sal's got this. There must be some place in Hell for a guy who sells a dollar-fifty a slice. I call you if anything comes up.
Rule number one: Don't get involved with patients. Rule number two: Don't get involved with patient's daughters. You understand?
Three legs.
Backup?
I'll drink to that.
No.
Where's Burke?
He's dead, Rose. Your father passed.
Tom, where are the Band-aids? This is an ambulance, isn't it?
Whatja doing?
The brakes are shot.
Get ready, Frank. Missed a drug shooting while you were dicking around in there. There's gonna be trauma tonight!
Destruction, distraction. I feel the need.
Get the kit! We're gonna tube him!
Oh yeah, you don't eat food.
Mr. Oh.
Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
I'm not feeling very well, Larry. I say we go back to the hospital and call it a night.
You're in the stomach!
Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
Don't name them.  Just tell me if you know.
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that.  You don't want to look shifty, do you?
Impossible.  There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
You packing up tonight?
Yes.  You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
He excels at gratitude.
That's your full name?
I might as well ask you the questions on tape.  Is that all right?
Eventually rising to...
Nine seconds.
I didn't sleep.  They're giving me less and less air time.  They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here.  Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
How'd it go?
Then what was good about it?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
I know you care about him.  I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
Why not try it for a few weeks?
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
Okay.
Prepare what?  You have Saturday's news handy?
You think anyone who's proud of the work we do is an ass kisser.
I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Do you know you're the second woman in network news history to produce?
Because...
You know, I like Tom, because hi...
Yes.  That's right.
No...no.
...and the White House is hoping to keep a lid on it for a few days till they figure out what to do.
I wish it were you giving the story.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Good.  He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
How horrible.  We'll be fine.  You'll be fine.  Stay here with me -- we'll go for a drive, have some drinks, make happy plans.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
It must be nice to always believe you know better.  To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn.  I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
So he was indicted?
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work.  I have it cold, confirmed.  They have five million dollars in this thing already.
Nervous?
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
It's not important.
What pills did you take?  You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic.  Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
So what did you think?
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
What?
That's not it.
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
Why?
I felt funny about it afterwards.  It's verboten, huh?  I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you.  That's not the reason you're not coming?
I got promoted for things like that.
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
This is very awkward.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up.  Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
That's enough.  That's enough.
That's not true I am a sculptor!
Well I'm touched.  You're serious, aren't you?
Tonight.
It's kind of dark -
That doesn't look like very much clay.
Walter can I ask you something?
Alright we're clear.
Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
See you later -
It's called spontaneity, Leonard. Get with the program.
How did you ever find it all in yourself, Walter?
These guys came by to help me try out some of my new organic recipes.
More champagne, your majesty?
Did you hear what he said?
I know what it is to be ignored.
Walter...stay away from me!
Ah, your new head shot...  I like it, very much...
Are you alright?
Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
Walter, what are you doing?
Where'd ya buy that?
Yeah.
You want to buy it, put it in the club?
Well...why did you put a knife in it?
Look, go home and...work on something. Make another cat.
You didn't mean to what?
It's hot in here...
A show?!  Like this Sunday?
Maxwell!  He's behind all this with all his stupid blowhard poetry!  Listen, you've got to stop right away!  I'm beginning to feel responsible!
Police officer.
But I got a feeling you're gonna cooperate with me.  Yessir, I think you and me are gonna be real good friends.  Why don't you tell me about your connection.
I didn't do nothing wrong!  That was Mayolia's!  I didn't ask her for it.  I don't know about any -
YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT ME!
I don't think anyone gets what I said, their blank faces staring, mute, unfeeling -
Wheat germ omelette, guava nectar and garbanzo sprinkled with smoked yeast.  Join us?
An' everyone will say Walter let me shake your hand...it's a real pleasure to have known you...
I won't say good luck, Walter.
It's like...you've turned on.
Let me into your world Walter... let me into that white hot inspired world.
Uh, Mrs. Swicker I got to meet some friends later, and I have to take a shower!
I will - good night Mrs. Swicker!
I don't think this is gold.
I like it.  Can I be your friend?
Nice to feel needed.
Man has a complex.
No, we didn't.
Come on, come on, fork up the scub.
It's coffee.
Let me in, Pike!  I'm hungry!
Did you see a girl come by here?
Wheels?
Hi, Buffy.
He doesn't look fifty.
Oh.  Who's in it?  I know what it is.  It's what's on instead of the movie.
Where were you last night?  I called your house like four times.
I can take care of myself, Jeffrey.
You left me a message?
This?  This is you only weapon? Your puny faith?
I am a God!  A God!
You want some water or something?
You had a car full of stuff.  Were you leaving?
Well, stay here tonight.
Hey, jeez are you okay?  You need a hand?
Things are kind of confusing.
I didn't expect to see you.
Dress, huh?  What for?
Right.  I'm the chosen one.  And I choose to be shopping.
I'm going out the front.
It has to be, like a socially conscious theme.
Bugs.
Like what?
What are we doing?
Wait a minute.  My birthright is in the graveyard?  Later not.
Let me get this straight.  You're like, this greasy bum, and I have to go to the graveyard with you 'cause I'm chosen, and there's vampires.
Just stay away from me, okay?
I was a slave.
How do you know all this?
Where's the other one?
Go to school tomorrow.  Try to act normal.  Don't let anyone know what's happening.  This is important. When the vampires find out who you are... you won't be hunting them anymore.
Meet me at this address after school.
Why do you keep saying that?
What?
Not a pressing issue.
Uh... gym.
Put your head back.
No... I guess I would have gotten Jeffrey to hit you.
What about bats?  Do they turn into bats?
And the alley was a mistake.  Never corner yourself like that.  If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now.  One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
A wet!  Didn't I just kill that vampire?  I think I did.  I didn't see you killing any vampires.  You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers?  Five.  Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart.  Do you want to live?  Do you?
So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
I mean, most of the time Jeffrey's really sweet, but sometimes he gets kind of... 'Me-Tarzan'ish, you know what I mean?  Lately it bugs me, I guess.  Merrick?  Are you still breathing?
I want to die.
Interesting.
There isn't time.
Oh, I'll be there all right.  I'm not letting you out of my sight. Not till you're ready.
Mr. Howard is so heinous.  He's always giving me a hard time.  I get a C-plus on the test and he tells me, 'You have no sense of history.'  I have no sense of history?  He wears a brown tie.
You guys blow.  I'm waiting on Cassandra.  She's gonna help me with my history.
Well, I guess you got what you came for.
No, wait.  I can be dumb.  Really. Or mean, or whatever.  I can learn. I'm useful.
The mark of the Coven.
But as long as there have been vampire, there has been the Coven; the line of Slayers.  Ones with the strength and the skill to kill them, to find them where they gather and stop the swell of their numbers. One dies, the next is called.
What are you grinning at?  You think I was scared?
You think so?
Write that down.
Okay, let's go.
I can't believe they still ate it.
I got all the plastic stuff.  What should I do with it?
And Spring Fling.
She was even crazier after that.  I mean it, you wouldn't even have recognized her.
Omniplex?
You're kidding.
Oh, my God!  Ouch!  No wonder you quit.
Environment.  That's cool with me.
Oh, yeah!
Buffy, the ape-woman.
Where am I gonna find another mechanic stupid enough to work for my money?
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
Sorry.  You look great.  I'm totally exhausted.
How was that?
I'm yours.
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
That's my leg.
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
What'd he say?
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Neither will I.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
Your place or mine?
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
And now you wanta teach me?
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
Annie---
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
God bless you.
You missed the tag!
Fun?  What's he know about fun?  Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
Why you shaking me off?
Fastball.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
How come you don't like me?
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball.  In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
I'm going to the Show.
You will.  Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it.  Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat.  That's the secret.  You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
I'm too old for this shit.  Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
I don't believe in fighting.
I'd kill ya.
Who you calling a "boy"?
Well tell 'em, honey.
No.  The guy's professional debut and he forgets about it.
Struck out eighteen...
Ohyeah.  I shoulda throwed a slider.  Damn, Crash, how're ya?
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once.  Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it.
I was never - I was never your guest at the Tangiers.
Mr Rothstein is being very typical to this point.
You know damn well I was at that dinner, and you swore to me that I would have a fair hearing at that dinner! Did you not?! Did you not?!  Well, tell me I was at least at the dinner! A-allow me that much.  Give me that much at least!
A powerful man.
You don't have to have a license to work in a casino. All you gotta do is apply for one. The state law says you can work in a casino while they're processing your application. They got a ten-year backlog.
He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this?  He's out of his fuckin' mind.
Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake?
I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad?
Even after a little vacation, they hassled him at the airport.
No, you're not calm.
Fine, fine. How's your family?
Okay.
Hello.
Now this is just a signature card.
No, tha-that's good. It's just unusual. To tell you the truth, so many of my clients don't.
You don't know? What time did your mother do this? When did she leave?
Yeah.
No, of course not.
But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose.
...Nicky was dreamin' his own kind of Vegas.
If he does it again, he's out for good. I don't care what it is, Nick, I'm gonna ha- I'll - I'll never let him in the place again.
Hey, I gotta give the guy credit. He does the most obvious thing. This is the only town in the country where a bookie joint is legit, so, why not take advantage, right?  So... he took bookie joints off the street and then opened them up inside the casino. Well, within a few years, by doin' all of this, he had every casino on the Strip trying to copy off him.
You better watch yourself. There's a lot of heat on you already.
Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this?
In other words, I'm fucked.
Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them.
No, no it's okay.
I have no control over that. Ronnie and Billy were right there. They'll tell you exactly what happened.
Looks bad? I'm gonna tell you what looks bad.
Nicky was questioned in two dozen murders, but they always had to let him go. There were never any witnesses.
What - what, Caesar's?
You want me to get out of my own fuckin' town?!
I'm what counts out here! Not your fuckin' country clubs or your fuckin' TV shows! And what the fuck are you doin' on TV anyhow?!
I just told you. She called me.
Hello.
Yeah, uh, who's this?
...Ginger's missing and she tied Amy up and she locked her in her room. I gotta find her. I don't know where the hell she is.
She's there with you?  She's there with you?
Ace don't... listen, don't... don't make a scene, all right?
Hey, it is my pleasure.
Are, uh -  - are we certain that you want the Gamin' Control Board eyeballin' your record and your gangster pals like Nicky Santoro?
You see?  Never tells me nothin'. Ace, what do we got on for next week?
Okay. You come by the house?
Seven o'clock?
Oh, yes. Will you help me fold these, please?
I mean, that's what worried me, 'cause it turns out Nicky was about to be sent to Vegas.
Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera?
Want something to drink? Charlie you want a refill?
Half of everything is mine.
...trying to offer you the respect that your...
...position...
It's always been our policy -
I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work.
We need this guy.
Yeah, Billy Sherbert, please. Put him on.
I-I'll do it.
I'm going to go powder my nose. 
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Understand?  I'm sorry.
Want to go? Let's go back in.
Oh, it's so soft.
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much.  Put your arm in there.
Twenty-five thousand? For yourself?
You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he?
Listen.  Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think -
You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones.
How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody.  You can do it.  You can do it.
...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.
...under?
I'm just tryin' to figure it out.
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
With Jennifer.
She had the same.
Why do you want to do that?
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
I was with somebody.
I want you to let me go.
Get - get up!
I wouldn't -
I am not!
I'm afraid she's gonna destroy stuff.
Should I let her in like - ?
Loose machines are right back over there.
All right, I will, I will.
Well, I... I never tried.
Yeah.
No, no? You didn't?
Fuckin' kids at home!  Here.  Get the fuck out of here.
You know where she gets this from!
What expenses?
Yeah, that works out.
So I put some of the money into legitimate deals with Charlie Clark. He was Ace's banker.
No, I don't want one.  Hey, Mr Clark, how you doin'?
You know... I think that you've gotten the wrong impression about me. I think in all fairness, I should explain to you what it is that I do. For instance, tomorrow morning I'll get up nice and early, take a walk down over to the bank and walk in and see you, and, uh... if you don't have my money for me, I'll crack your fuckin' head wide open in front of everybody in the the bank. And just about the time that I'm comin' out of jail, hopefully, you'll be comin' out of your coma. And guess what?  I'll split your fuckin' head open again. Because I'm fuckin' stupid. I don't give a fuck about jail.  That's my business. That's what I do. And we know what you do, don't we, Charlie? You fuck people out of money and get away with it.
I'm just trying to get in my house!
Can I go in?
Oh my God, what are we gonna do? I'm sorry.
Do you see that? Dumb Jew motherfucker. Grew up together and he's actin' like he don't even know me. I know we're supposed to avoid each other, but, you know, there's ways to do things and there's ways not to.
Oh.
He's not here?
...I want all the names of all the other people he had with him. And I don't care what you have to do to him to get 'em. You understand?
Frankie... they found a guy's head in the desert. Do you know about that?
You gotta tell him... to take care of things a little better.
Frankie, I want to ask you something.
So, I lied... even though I knew that by lyin' to Gaggi, I could wind up gettin' killed too.
Well, you gotta understand it. He doesn't know if this guy is shaking you down or taking advantage of you.
You're a beautiful girl. You don't want to ruin your looks. I've seen a lot of girls get shot to hell from this stuff.
What? What?
Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead.
No, he's not.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
Yeah.
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway?
Great.
...same outfit.
Come on.
What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too?
- with stupid braces on your teeth.
Every time I ever see you, that's what I see.
Don't give me any of your shit!  Okay, this has always been a dream, but we're going.
Ginger... It means he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, waiting for me to call him back. Now, I -
He's sittin' by the phone -
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
No, I'm not gonna drive with some crazy -
- back to  Nigeria.  Yeah.
They checked in alone.
There's more! There's a couple stuck in there. I know there's more.
Wow.
Incredible.
How many of these you gonna eat, huh?
Mm-hm.
Well, how come I laid nine?
Ace saw Vegas one way.
Come here, come here.
Whenever we got local merch, we'd usually send it to Palm Spring or Arizona... LA. I had a couple of sand niggers out there. You know, Arabs.
This is Nick.
I do all the work. Somebody don't like it, fuck him.
Mm.
Yeah, but they keep askin' about it.
Take it easy!
I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad.
Frankie! Frankie, you piece of shit!
All right, yeah. You got that thing for me?
Again!
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
Yes, uh...

How heroic of you...
You designed Gotham Plaza?  The big silver guys pulling on those big silver things...
I checked out your stuff at the library.  Awesome work, really. Why would someone like you want to go out with a...with a..what exactly am I, again?
Exactly. I don't know what I'd do without you.
Tonight, somewhere in the city, innocent people will die--but then one of you knows that; for one of you is a vicious pirate-terrorist posing as the beloved superhero Captain God.
In many ways, that obnoxious creep Cactus was the worst one of all. He got off on giving out pain...
I thought you said you weren't a very good liar.
Women, huh?
We're waiting.
But then we knew that all along, didn't we...
Catwomen. Lots of them!
What do you want from me?
Oh Honey, it's so much better when we do it without the helmet.
Boss-man, what were you going on about last night: "I am the Law and I am the Danish..."
God-damn..
Ah, did you hear that?  Spooky loved you...
Quite a little performance you gave in the casino today--for me and that other guy. Come on down, let's chat..
Car wash, Captain?
The Tranquilizer Tranquility will hold for about an hour..where is she? These women are out here on a lark-- Ladies Night at a discotheque.  It's not in their blood the way it is for Catwoman...Where is she?
I want out of tonight's mission. I can't do it anymore, Captain. I can't let innocent people die to prove our superiority..I can't.
I loved you.
My, those little ears pick up a lot. The Cult of Good will die heroically preventing a world-class heist. Since we will be the ones performing the heist, our deaths will obviously be fake. But have no fear. There will be many other deaths tomorrow...and those will be quite real. I'm afraid these questions of yours put you in a position not unlike a long-tailed tabby in room full of rocking chairs.
I'm supposed to be taking personality tips from you three?  You people were once heroes. You had ideals.  You fought for things.  Spooky told me so...
I heard what you said, Spooky. I can't believe he shot you...
You Housewives have no idea what we go through!
You know, Kyle, you're still pretty hot for a pre-Bicentennial babe...
Oh, what?  I offer you a job in implied exchange for physical favors and suddenly it's "sexual harassment..."
I don't know what came over me.
No, of course not. You're listed. Not the hut, exactly, but the rest of..
Lose the smile, Mr. Good Reflexes. We were having a pretty okay time the other night--good food, good conversation--some Catwomen show up and it's "You need cab fare?; I got to go to my Hideout--Oh, I'm sorry, I mean "warehouse."
Okay, deal.
You're late.
You're the One. I thought I told you to stay hidden behind the couch, CAT! You've torn the unit apart.  You've driven a great leader insane...
Was someone in an accident?
What are you doing on Theo's line?
I know he's there!  He doesn't even have the balls to pick up the phone!
Who's on the phone?
What was that for?
So what?  What could be important enough to put your hands on me?
She can't!  It's busted.  Now hand that on back!
What's this?
In case you crapped out it was my job to go after that briefcase.
I told you I should've cuffed him.
He's seen both of us now.
I don't like anybody laying their hands on me.
If you know that just back off.
First off, this Mr. Chow Yen doesn't speak a lot of English. The girl with him will interpret. There will be a third person to accompany you into the men's room where you can take count.  I hope you know Krugerands better than they know a <u>Hockney</u>.
Okay, okay, Lenore, calm down. Either let me call the school or better yet, the F.B.I.
Lose the hardware now.
Any minute.
If this is some sales pitch I'm not buying --
Lady, try making some sense.
What'd you do!  Just pick my number out of the air?
Who smashed the phone?
I don't want to know --
Okay.  The police are gonna need your full name and address.
I'm fine.  She's back on.  Hello?  I'm here.
I'm with two friends now.
The bigger man is driving our Mercedes to the school.  Rachel will recognize the car.  She'll get right in.
26th off Wilshire.
What do you think I'm doing?  I'm on my way to the school like you wanted.
Hey drop it, okay?
I have no right to ask for help. I've never thought of anybody but myself.
There are cables overhead.  Hang on.  It'll clear up.
What's happening?
Don't say anything.  Don't alarm them.  Just go!
He's copying down my license -- for all the good it'll do him.
Which means you can't be more than five or ten minutes from here.
Do you know what's in that box?
You're doing what you can.  Why's all this money stashed?
Yeah, sure that's me.  Ask anybody.
You can't give up.
What did you do?
He's in back.  Lying face down. They haven't hurt him anymore -- but he was crying.  I never heard Jack cry before --
Yes sir.
They won't allow that.  It's one at a time.  And you have to be first.
We've almost got your husband and your daughter out.  So don't get any ideas.
So far they're keeping their part of it.
For Christ sakes don't point it at me.  We want to get Rachel out of there in one piece.  I'm waiting for the girl.  Her mother wants to talk to her.
Your friends are probably still on the line.  Pick it up and say hello.
Those shots your associates got off may not have done him too much good.  That's on their head.  All I did I was put him there.
I'm still okay.
Do you think they'll walk away?
Wonderful feeling of security knowing your adversaries are both crippled and unarmed.
Any idea where you're going?
What's really on your wicked little mind?
What's your point?
Maybe your friends already accomplished that chore for us.
I'm going to cuff you and leave you in that house.  It may take awhile but you'll be found after we're long gone.
Think about what's going to happen to your valuables when that trunk flies open at 75 miles per?
Five ... six.
Oh God -- Oh no -- Help me -- Don't let me -- Die.
Don't leave me here to die -- Theo, please -- you can't let me die --
Who are you working for?
Twenty percent.
They saw you kill the driver.
You're walking away with a clear fifty percent and a guarantee nobody can afford to I.D. you.
I want you all in one vehicle. Your van.  If I see anybody else cruising around I'll keep going. No second chances.  You can kill them and I'll keep what I've got.
You should've done all this before.
Her husband said there'd be one million eight.  So nine hundred to you.
And then?
I'm opening the side door.  She'll step out.  But before she gets in your vehicle I want to see the first installment put down in plain view.  If it isn't there I'm shooting her in the back.
That's how it is.  You see her approaching you toss out installment one.
Seems like it.
You're going to have to see to it that both lanes of this road get blocked.
From what I can see you're a pretty fair wheelman.  There's a hairpin coming up -- that's the place for it. The cops'll plow right into you.
Yeah?
In the hills above Sunset.  Just below the Getty.
I'm in awe.
Since when did you guys start changing tires?
The 405 is coming up.
See that, Col?
Just cut his hair, you know.
What you think?
Saw that one.
That's what he said. Jimmy.
Maybe he wants something.
He's back, Col
Cunt. Scrag-eyed dyke cunt.
Take your clothes.
No, I won't fucking fuck off. Said I'm sorry, didn't I?
Do you mean that?
What's that supposed to mean?
Sorry won't bring the bloody thing back, will it, Mr. Franknum?
I'm sure you do, Mr. Deveroux.
No.
What was that?
You all right?
He's getting up.
Someone out there.
You want to know how I kissed him?
Do I?
Did he come here too?
Maybe.
The thing is, can you go the distance?
Tell him it hurt --
Sure I do.
Kind of liked you as a girl.
How?
Do they know?
That's true.... Your soldier knew, didn't he?
Should have stayed a girl.
Don't.
She's the thing you had to tell me.
What you doing, Jimmy?
You'd do anything for me?
You want another haircut, baby?
You said anything, Dil
You'd like me better that way, Jimmy?
Why are we going here, Jimmy?
Are you supposed to take that many?
Dil Can I tell you something? I knew your man.
You didn't.
You tried.
Wondered why you came on to me like that when you gave me the look.
See, I should blow you away, Jimmy. But I can't do that. Yet.
Then say it.
What would you do for me?
What's Fergus?
Dil!!!
She was --
Yes.
Got you the multivitamins and the iron tablets, hon --
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
Leave us, Judie.
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
Of course. I forgot.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Made the front page. They'll move now, the fuckers.
So?
Why?
I'm getting emotional. And I don't want to get fucking emotional -- you understand, Hennessy?
Who is he?
Hope not.
No?
But I won't. We're more polite around these parts.
What makes you think that?
She's a friend of mine
Well, in Antigua cricket's the black man's game. The kids play it from the age of two. My daddy had me throwing googlies from the age of five. Then we moved to Tottenham and it was something different.
Thank you. I had a case of the clap two years ago. Crabs in Ulster. But all in all it's served me well.
Come on, man. If this shit was all over.
We don't look on it like that.
That you guys shouldn't be here.
Is it bad?
Don't know her.
What?
Help me.
Cause you're my friend. And I want you to go to the Metro --
Don't run off, Jude.
Never pissed holding a girl's hand, Jude.
I never know nothing.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 --  no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- Élysées! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
Now what?
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
I believe you.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Carson?
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
Are you sure there's no mistake?
No.
That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
Around one.
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to --  marriage license! Did you say -- ?
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Sorry about that.
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
Your --
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
Said what?
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
I'd love some, thanks.
Reggie -- open the door.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
No -- not yet.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
Monsieur Félix -- ?
I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854.
The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer.  Today it has a value of $100,000.  Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them.
What for? If it's not here, why bother him?
You think that mebbe we're fishin' the wrong stream?
Nachurly. Jus' like I'd tell you.
What do you mean, no?
Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead.
I'm afraid that will have to wait, Mrs. Lampert.
Yes.
Where did he keep his money?
Obviously.  One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Of course it is.
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild.  We don't know each other, do we?
Please, not on my account.
Doing what?
We'll find you a hotel.
Hallo, Peter.
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
What are you doing in here?
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
On the street where you live.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
Nothing. Good night.
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
It belongs to me, Miz Lampert -- an' if you don't give it to me your life ain't gonna be worth the paper it's printed on. You savvy what I'm sayin', Miz Lampert?
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
Have you no idea who could have done it?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Howdy, Miz Lampert.
This ain't no game, Miz Lampert.
I think it's funny.
ARE YOU THE KILLER BEN?
I get all your CDs.
So you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.
I swear to God. It's her. She told Jody she was Kenny's 'AUNT LISA'. I'm getting this sickly feeling...
Hi honey.
Not much further.
Who is she Daddy?
Did you warn her?
She's not here.
Can you describe her? How old was she?
Is there a picture of her somewhere?
No.
Really?
Why?
You gave me a 'D'.
of COURSE. You're not scared?
Yes.
You get to be a little Chelsea Clinton. Everyone wants to meet you. Party with you. Have sex with you.
He's just trying to mess with your head. Ignore him.
Oh nice save.
Personally I think he has a deep, almost pathological desire to corrupt you. But I suppose that's a type of love. I certainly wish someone wanted to corrupt me.
How do you know what to type back when they start to cyber with you.
Sandy, you have to chill out, at least two-thirds of the kids in our class are still virgins. He can't butcher all of us.
You ok?
It's like a pop your cherry party. Everyone's saying it's 'Fuck or Die' time.
Unfortunately I qualify. Think I'm too old?
I was supposed to be home fifteen minutes ago.
I got to get home.
I heard you got attacked.
You know I want to go with you.
You flaunt some slut in my face.
My dad's down there!
Mom?
Did he say anything else about her?
She's nobody you should be concerned with.
I don't know. We just did. I guess I was kind of scared going against the gain. Against the whole town.
Who?
Two men left town right after it happened.
Yes.
You got a great mom. I'm lucky to get a zucchini stick.
Yeah I was talking about Twinkies the other day and I realized I hadn't had one in years. Then I remembered seeing you with one.
Maybe it won't stay in.
Unfair?!
Where's Sam?
The guy's a fuckin' moron.
Since today.  New policy.
Yeah, well, Darlene didn't say anything about it to me, so tell Andy to bill her like usual and let them sort it out. Move.
Well, he told me to collect cash.
...moron.
Uh, huh?
Bein' that it's cash, I'm gonna give you ten percent...
What did I say?
No, no, no.  You don't need my truck. You need somebody else's truck...
All right.
Wait, wait, wait.  Hold up.  Hold up.  Look.
I'll rent the truck from you.  You can stay here, you can go.  Whatever you want.
All right, then how about this?
...up.

...town. 
No way.  We're goin' through McGrud-...
Look...I kinda borrowed the truck from Andy.
...-damn!

Okay!  All right!
...-er!
Shut up, shut up!  It's beeping.
Holy shit...
...up!
Come on, old...
...is, old Pete!  Come on, baby!
Oh, shit.
Hey, and what if we  don't make it?!
Come on, old Pete.
I'm goin'.  I'm goin', baby.  I'm goin', I'm goin'.
Get over!  Get over!
Oh, shit.  Come on, old...
...-hood of you knowin' any prayers is slim...
Come on...
Whoo!
 Okay.  That didn't work.
...ho!

 Oh, shit.  Oh, shit. 
He's crazy!
You're--?  What?!
This thing just went up a degree.  Ice cream's not workin'.

...did you?
Hey, I didn't steal the truck.  You...
Hey, I told you I did not steal that truck.  Andy owes me a lot more than that four-wheeled...

...deal with this asshole.

Arlo, shut up.
We're gonna die!


Arlo!
Oh, shit.
...tunnel!
Mason.

What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

What'd you come back for?!
We're the shit.  Bigtime.
...and-and-and truckless in the service of my country...
Thank you very much.
...-tiatin'.
...us.
No.
 you see, that was a-that was my mission.

 Just give me Elvis and I'll make sure you have enough money for a dozen ice cream trucks.
Why don't you get that tub of shit Sam to...
 ...have it.  You have to...have to get it to M...to McGruder.
You got a prob-...
...the guy the Army guys are lookin' for!
We've got it...

They were all wearing hardware.
Yes, sir.
Sweeney tells me you don't have computer confirmation?
"I am become Death, the...
No!
...about--
No, go--
...-ple.
Mm-hm.
...always done, Richard?
All right.  After they put you away...

I can't say it's a surprise.
Get 'em on line, then stall.  Long can't have gotten far.


Of which we have more than enough.
Carl!  Set up the camera.
Hit him again.
This was supposed to be a...
Shit.
Dennis!
What about these two?
Hemmings!  Sam, I thought I told you to close up shop and be ready to move up the island by night-...
...gear?
....-lene.
Doc...
Doc Long.  Yeah, I know him.  Weirdo guy. He comes in from...
...should be right outside.
Yeah, I'm listenin'.


 



No.


Why?  You're a nothing, nobody!  Why?
...it.
 Two pots of coffee...
Uh, we both like to fish.
Video lock.
Rangers.
Morning, doc.  Awful early, aren't ya?
...create a piece of bait that sends the fish's instincts into overdrive...
Cold?  Cold.  How cold?
And only then does our noble friend realize...
 I don't know.  Um, he's working, but there's a lot of data. Maybe...another hour?
...you, Mason?
Mason.  Mason!
If it was Wednesday night, I was workin'.
You find yourself wearing a...
...to talk, son.
I said let me see your hands now!
  All right.
...gotta seal it.
Negative.  Negative.
How come all these new names are pasted into the plat book?
They're calling it an accident.
Lou Escobar – he's a Lieutenant.
Oh yes.
Far as it goes. Of course he has to swim in the same water we all do.
...Exactly what do you know about me, Mr. Gittes?
'Course I'm respectable. I'm old. Politicians, ugly buildings and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. I'll double whatever your fees are and I'll pay you ten thousand dollars if you can find Hollis' girlfriend.
Yes, his girlfriend.
Yes. She's disappeared, hasn't she?
No.
Just find the girl.
How do you do that?
Of course I do. Where are you?
What are you talking about?
You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
...No...
How much do you owe me, Curly?
Thanks, Lou.
Congratulations.
Looking for someone.
What are you doing here?
You were following him night and day. You saw who killed him. You even took pictures of it. It was Evelyn Mulwray. She's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.
Yeah, I once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. That's where she drew the line.
I know what he says.
No, Gittes, you'll show us.
Well, let's go.
You never learn, do you, Gittes?
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
Mr. Gittes.
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
What?
May I speak frankly, Mrs. Mulwray?
Mrs. Mulwray, I'm afraid that's not good enough.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
Mr. Gittes.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
How did it happen?
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
Everything you can see, everything around us. I was at the Hall of Records today.  That bother you?
Yeah. They've been blowing these farmers out of here and buying their land for peanuts. Have any idea what this land'll be worth with a steady water supply? About thirty million more than they paid.
You're looking at the owners of a 50,000 acre empire.
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
Hold still. Why?
Where are you going?
I know.
Yes.
I can't...
Don't worry. I'm not telling anybody about this.
Let me handle that.
Walsh here?
Jesus Christ, this guy's really got water on the brain.
Well, I'm a working girl, Mr. Gittes. I didn't come in to see you on my own.
Oh my goodness.
There's just one question.
Just to be certain, I wonder if you could show us a list of your patients?
I wonder, is it too late for us to have a look around?
Can I help you?  Russ Yelburton, Deputy Chief in the Department.
He never even kids about it.
Relax, Mulvihill, glad to see you.  Do you know Claude Mulvihill here?
You ought to be more careful. That must really smart.
Mr. Gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.
Jake, what're you doin' here?
Yeah.
The L.A. River?
Ida Sessions wants to see you.
How do you do, Mrs. Mulwray?
Lot of turnover these days. Better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.
Mr. Yelburton will be busy for some time.
He's liable to be tied up indefinitely.
Think you can nail Mulvihill? They'll claim you were trespassing.
Neither do I.
That right?... She used to be some looker.
She must be about thirty-three, thirty- four.
Oh, you know. She was sixteen or seventeen.
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here.  Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
What are you doing here?
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Yes. I want proof.
Now what can you see?
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!'  You remember the story of the soldier and the princess? 
Father, I have sinned...
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
So what'd they say?
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead. 
That's fine, Mr. Kane.
Three cents.
This is all figured at three cents a copy.
My Declaration of Principles -  Don't smile, Brad -  Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
You don't wanta make any promises, Mr. Kane, you don't wanta keep.
It's wonderful, Mr. Kane.  Wonderful. Wonderful.
Go in and ask him to hurry.
He's a great guy - Leland.  Why'd he ever leave New York?
Yes.  I thought it was a good idea. We've covered it from the news end, of course.
Who else did you see?
He finished it.  He wrote the worst notice I ever read about the girl he loved.  We ran it in every paper.
The way things turned out, I don't need to tell you - Miss Emily Norton was no rosebud!
Mr. Leland, why didn't you go to Europe with him?  He wanted you to.  He said to me just yesterday -
Mr. Bernstein, am I a stuffed shirt? Am I a horse-faced hypocrite?  Am I a New England school-marm?
What's happened?
If you hadn't come along and protected me when you did, I'd have killed them fellows.
Where is it - where's my notice? I've got to finish it!
I suppose he's fixing it up - I know I'd never get that through.
You may resume your work, gentlemen.  I didn't know your plans and so I was unable to make any preparations.
But a morning newspaper, Mr. Kane. After all, we're practically closed twelve hours a day - except for the business offices -
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter.  Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested.  Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
But, Mr. Kane -
Mr. Kane, this is a surprise!
Yes, Mr. Kane.
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Almost two to one -
Emily!
I know it is, Brad -
Oh yes, there is.
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me.  And if you think - if any of you think -
You've got some on your face.
What's funny now?
Oh!
A chicken?
Excuse me, Mr. Kane.  I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you?  I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
I didn't think you did.  If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Would you sing for me?
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie.  I just couldn't -  I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you.  That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you.  Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you.  They just 0
I mean in New York.
It's not a habit.  I do it because I like it.
I mean it.  Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
Well, I'm not going to stop it.  I'm going to say exactly what I think.  You've never given me anything.  You've tried to buy me into giving you something.  You're -  - it's like you were bribing me!  That's what it's been from the first moment I met you.  No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known.  Tried to bribe them!
It is the unanimous opinion of my Cabinent - in which I concur - that the proposed leases are in the best interests of the Governement and the people.  You are not, I hope, suggesting that these interests are not indentical?
I know the facts, Mr. Kane.  And I happen to have the incredible insolence to differ with you as to what they mean.  You're a man of great talents, Mr. Kane.
You goin', Mom?
I came to see you, Charles, about your - about the Enquirer's campaign against the Metropolitan Transfer Company.
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Mrs. Kane would like to see you, Mr. Kane.
Oh, yes, sir.
Charles, I tell you there is no war! There's a condition that should be remedied - but between that and a -
Say, Brad.  I've got an idea.
I'd like to talk to you about that.
First of all, I will not write a good review of a play because somebody paid a thousand dollars for an advertisement in the "Enquirer."
All right.
She hasn't any friends left sine you started this oil business, and she never sees you.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Oh, yes, the bonus.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
You're going to live with Mr. Thatcher from now on, Charlie!  You're going to be rich.  Your Ma figures - that is, er - she and I have decided that this isn't the place for you to grow up in. You'll probably be the richest man in America someday and you ought to -
Mr. Leland, you were -
Sorry, Mr. Leland.
What's this?
I guess maybe I'm not as hard to see through as I think.  Anyway, I never even answered his letter. Maybe I should have.  I guess he was pretty lonely down there those last years.  He hadn't finished it when she left him - he never finished it - he never finished anything.  Of course, he built it for her -
Yes, and maybe he didn't.
Thompson!
Yes, sir - yes, sir, I knew how to handle the old man.  He was kind of queer, but I knew how to handle him.
I didn't get a thing.  Just the music lessons.  That's all there was to it.
I'll come down in a week or so and see her again.  Say, you might be able to help me.  When she used to talk about Kane - did she ever happen to say anything - about Rosebud?
How long have you been smoking?
Thanks. Have a good one.
I think you'd better leave now.
Dick.
So where is he?
Am I missing something here?
Why?
My God. I haven't seen you since... 
Train. It took eight hours.
You saw it?
I'm not pregnant.
I would've told you, and you would have stopped calling, like a baby.
Because I know you. You prefer drastic measures to rational ones.
Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck.
I'm giving him his ring back.
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major?
You work in a market, all right.
You're such an asshole.
I can already tell this isn't going to work.
And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so...  God! That was so great!
Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal?
Then who operated the store?
Using filthy language in front of the customers... you should both get fired.
Fuck in a second! This is... Look at you! You can't even pass!
Like you're better!
That's easy to say from over here.
My point is that you're a clerk, paid to do a job. You can't just do anything you want while you're working.
All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent.
You only brought one ball?!
Someone jammed gum in the locks.
That's what I said.
One fight a day with Veronica is about all I can stomach, thanks.
Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.
All four?
Empire.
What's that?
Yeah.
Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.
Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.
What's he looking for?
It's not like you laid the eggs yourself.
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.
There aren't.
It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.
Vermont?
Don't yell at me, pal.
I haven't seen her in almost two years.
What!?
I'm not taking you to this funeral.
I can't close the store.
Shut the hell up.
Because I never tried to suck my own dick?
Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later.
Her fucking body fell out!
The reasons you won't let me borrow your car is because I have a title and a job description, and I'm supposed to follow it, right?
I thought you never sold cigarettes to kids.
You're lying.
Then why aren't you like screaming at me right now?
Now I know you're lying.
You're kidding.
Hey, what about Veronica?
You just fucked a total stranger?
She said she did all the work.
Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.
It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?
Who're you kidding? You can so.
Lovely story.
To talk to you.
It's not like I'm miles away.
To say the least.
He's got those love handles.
Do I know you?
I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class.
Yes, they are. You're out of shape.
Pretty girl, about this girl's height- dark hair-gorgeous body?
How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store.
Relax brother. What I mean is that you sell the stuff in this store at the highest prices around. A dollar seventy-nine for wraps-what's that shit?
At Food City it's ninety-nine cents, plus tax.
So why do you sell it for so much more? I'll tell you why-because people come here and they're like "A dollar eighty for soda? I should get it at Food City. But I don't feel like driving there. I'll just buy it here so I don't have to drive up there." That's exploiting a weakness, too, isn't it?
That's fucked up. Yo, I heard he was jerkin' off.
You used to go out with her?
Be careful.
Actually, it is kind of rough.
All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave.
I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.
Don't you have a hockey game at two?
What were you doing?
Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
You're trusting.
I was kidding.
Three?
Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
They put up the least amount of struggle.
Why do you call him that?
You sucked that guy's dick?
I did understand! I understand that you slept with three different guys, and that's all you said.
WHAT? SOMETHING LIKE THIRTY-SIX?
What the hell is that anyway, "something like thirty-six?" Does that include me?
What is it?
What did he say?
A couple...?
You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine!  The slut is yours!
You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more?
And having him tell me... that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless.
I'm not out of shape!
Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
Is he staying here?
Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape?
I think the lady called it.
I beg your pardon!
Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party.
And... he told you all of this?
I... I don't know what to say.
After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut!
Dental School.
I have first dibs.
Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs.
Twenty bucks?
Willam!
No, I transferred into Monmouth this year. I was tired of missing him. 
C-4?
Jessie, Hal, come in...please report.  Over.
Looks like the Tower.  It's a bad climb.
I'm coming out!
What the hell are you doing here?!
Now let me fill you in.  You can get your ass back down an' go back to that hole you been hiding in--
What the hell do you know about bad time.  You didn't love her, you didn't have to explain to her family.
Forget me.  If you can, get away.
What are we going to do?
I'm going with you.
Two...
Do you see them yet?
That's a virtue isn't it?
Oh, my God!  I can't recognize the face, but the butt does look vaguely familiar. 
Why can't you believe that you did everything you could?
Then turn it off, Gabe, because it doesn't get any better.
I don't understand?
Excuse me?
A flare up...
Course maybe you don't have to wait until I faint.
If he gets up there and the weather gets as bad as it can, they'll never make it down.  He needs someone who has emergency medical training and knows every handhold on these peaks.
That's not the issue here, those people are.  He can't do it alone.
Frank dropped me in the west valley and I hiked.  You look frozen.  What's happening?!
Let's be creative.
Remember the first time we came up here?
She's a lyin' bitch!!
I'm holding you to that.  Gabe, what about Frank?
But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
What about you?!
Your mouth's writing a check your ass can't cash, but if ya wanna buy some life, bring me the money.
He'll freeze.
What's he doing?
Souvenirs?  No, wrong answer. Looks like your friend plans on hanging around, that possible?
For Christ's sake, they're kids.
He never hurt anybody.
No, the goddamn game's not over! It's never over when you're playing against a team that doesn't care if they win or lose-- how do you negotiate with someone like that?!
What's your names?
On top of the peak.
Right.
Travers!  Hurry it up.
Why didn't you send the money over?
What's the delay?
Get off my back, Qualen!
This way.
This is insane.  The hell with the money.  You radio in for that chopper, understand!
You got what we need?
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.
One minoota, droogie. Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The others run away, laughing.
No, my health doesn't allow it.
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!
Help you.
So this is the young man?
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself now.
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit. Alex sits next to him.
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers of the milicents for a long time now.
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on by the treatment they gave you?
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you need pretty polly, you take it.
Not tonight - not this nochy.
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to make his arrest. Alex retching. Minister rises.
Good.
Thank you, sir.
What job and how much?
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...  ... What have you done with all my own personal things?
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my Pee and Em, to make?
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the horrible smell.
What do I want?
Yes sir.
Pick that up and put it down properly. Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.
You're absolutely right, sir.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
How are you feeling today?
I'm your Psychiatrist.
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.
Good. What do you want?
Fucking hell...
I hope so. Is that the end then?
I was quite enjoying that.
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me brother? Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some money.
Father - may I ask you a question in private?
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I want to be good.
One jacket - blue pinstripe.
Sir, 655321, sir.
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.
I'll take Sixth.  It's faster.
You like Bach?
Could'a fooled me, the way you were hollering into that cell phone.
You like being a lawyer?
You need a vacation.
Thanks for everything, Max.  Wow...
Max, the cab driver!
Did you say <u>Dmitri?</u> How do you know about my case?  I don't understand...
...he's two floors below you.
Where are you, what floor?
He doesn't know you're up there!  Just stay right where you are!  Call the police!
Like Winton Marsalis says, it was pure, spiritual essence.  Louis was playing.  God was smiling.
Get outta here!  You and Louis?
How do I know you'll keep your word?
Tell me, Vincent.  Do you believe in Santa Claus?
What?
Vincent.  Do not cross me.
Something going on?
...goddamn it, you telling me this motherfucker's whacked three of our witnesses tonight...
...got off the phone with his dispatcher.  What an asshole. Cabbie's name is Max Rilke, been driving that cab for ten years...
...so, his description of Max the cabdriver matches the guy who walked out of Villa Rodeo.  That guy?  That guy is a cabbie.  And you're telling me this cabbie walks into a phone booth and emerges as a meat eater, assassin with heavy trigger time? What's he do, squeeze 'em in between fares?
Dmitri <u>Gusunov?</u> What the fuck, why? Forget about Dimitri, Feds are all over him.  They're a heartbeat away from taking him down.  Word's gone out, they don't want us anywhere near him...
I never bought that.
Something big's going down, and I'm betting the Feds don't know about it. You gotta get us in there.
What if they're wrong?
I know you're out there!  Answer the goddamn call!
He's not paying you one cent!
...what do you want me to do, punch him out?  I have to work with him...
It's home.
You on some kind of work plan?
Twenty-four minutes!  Man, you're hot...
Regulations?  These guys don't even give you sick leave.  How much you pull down on a good night?
He fell on my cab!  From up th-th-there.
You cool, Max?  Say "I'm cool."
Got it?
Uh, look...why don't you just take the car...
You listening to me?
Nothing.  I only met him the one time.
I don't know any Rwandans.
That one's probably married.  Think of his kids.  His wife's pregnant...
Hands on the wheel.  Ten and two o'clock, like they taught you in driver's ed.
It was an accident.  You're not liable.  Tell him.
So what?
Another collateral.
Collateral damage.
Let him go, Vincent.
Max?  What are you doing?
Don't even think you're walking away from me.
Mom, Vincent's not interested.
You take one more step, I'll kill her.
Hey, I'm not the one who's been lying to my mother.
It's cause they don't like their lives, so they project their patterns of negative behavior onto you...  I had a father like that.
He hated everything I did.  Hated me. Got drunk and beat the shit out of me, daily...
Well, this big stake's got to be big by now.  When you leaving?
How long have you been a hit man?
Damn, Max.  I'm impressed.  Really.  I would have bet good money you wouldn't walk out of there.
Washington and Holt.  Dance club called "Fever." Know it?
What holds you back, Max?  Tell me. Why does life scare you so much?
Who's Heller?
Yeah, that.
Get with it.  Get over it. ...millions of galaxies of hundreds of millions of stars and a speck on one in a blink...that's us.  Lost in space.  The universe doesn't care.  The cop, you, me?  Who notices?
As in...? 
Look in the mirror.  ...piss-ant paper towels...a bottle of 409...saving up for goin' to the Comoros.  How much you got saved?
'Cause I never got it straightened up; made the push, made the moves...
Slow the hell down!
What happened?
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
You going to warn him?
Switch 'em.  Or I'll be dead by morning.  Don't want to be dead.
People do have heart attacks.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch.  And thanks.
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
Well that's the eye right there. <u>Money</u>.  And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world.  The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
So why are they after you?
You okay?
Stone is their spokesman.  You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it?  Stone's a disinformation flunky.  The face that he's alive says it all.
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
Who are you, Jerry?
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context.  Know what I mean?
Did you see the van back there?
Jesus... It's my fault.  They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on.  I'm passing it to you, too.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse.  I should have realized.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
Do you watch the news?  Read the paper.  Last week, this whole place was underwater.
You will?
I know that.  I'm just -- I'm nervous.  I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics.  And I know how I feel.
Yeah...  Would you, I mean, could you love me then?  If I was normal.  Maybe?
Are you okay?  I wish I hadn't told you what I did.  But I can't help the way I feel.  You don't hold that against me, do you?
Now what?
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox?  Just because they say so?  We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
Blue moon... Blue moon...
How did you know?
I love you, too.
You shouldn't watch, Jerry.  It's a moment without hope.
Liza Sutton is dead.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow.  But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you.  Does that seem honorable?
That's not what I mean.  I want to see her.
Then screw you.  I'll rot.
And you feel bad for it?
And you have no idea where he lives?
A charming term.  Now, <u>why him</u>?
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Hmm, how about tomorrow night?
I'm not that good at 'no,' Liza.
Liza, settle a bet for us.
The office is closed for the evening. Is this an emergency?
I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher.  We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone.  Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
Jonas?
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
That you come with me.
... And this is how the extraterrestrial presented himself to you?  As your father?
He died...  ... in 1972.
Mike, because of the Earth's rotation we're only in line with Vega so many hours a day; the only way to get the whole message is to cooperate with other stations.  If Dr. Arroway hadn't moved quickly we could have lost key elements.
Hope there's a cartoon.
I'm not.  You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
Two:  There's nothing out there but noble gasses and carbon compounds and you'd be wasting your time.
Pepsi?  Tequila?
No... You're not.  But the price has just gotten too high.
Then why haven't you detected any signals?  If, as you claim, there have been thousands, millions of advanced civilizations out there for millions of years then why hasn't one signal gotten through?  It'll take a month or two for the paperwork to go through; you're welcome to stay until then.
The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
Apparently he's genuinely interested in science.  This could be a chance to win him over.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds.  There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile.  We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
They knew our level of development. If, as you say, they've done this many times they'd be well aware of the implications.
You aren't staying?
Right.  Well.
Ellie... we both know that if I was any kind of a man, I never would've entered this race.  That I would have told the President straight out:  Helen, Eleanor Arroway is naive and strident and an enormous pain in the ass... but she's got more courage and intelligence than the rest of us put together.  That more then anyone else on the planet, she's earned this.  And that she should be the one to go because she's the best we have.  But that's not who I am.  I like to think it's who I might've been if things had gone a different way; that I might have been worthy, really worthy of what I've been given...  You do what you have to do.  And in the end, as with everything, it comes down to power.  And it isn't fair...
What does it say?
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
What...
What?
How can that be?
J39 Z186...?
Dr. Cullers?
Can't we get rid of them?
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
... I don't understand it.  All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
Could we hear to the moon?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
Am I one... or many?
You live here.
You've... found it.  What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
A sunrise and a sunset every forty- five minutes.
Why don't you come back with me?
Please.  Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F.  I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
The V.L.A.?
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
You sonofabitch.
It's good to see you, Ellie.
Thank God.  When we lost contact, I thought -- we thought... but you're okay.  We're still trying to determine the nature of the malfunction.  Did you notice anything at all that --
Peter... What is going on?  Has everyone gone completely insane?
Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
Relativity.  Explain this to me one more time... even if you traveled near the speed of light, when you came back --
During the crusades -- pilgrims who made the journey to the holy land brought back a palm frond to show they'd actually been there.  I thought it sort of made sense that Earth is now your holy land, so...
What...?
Ellie, what is it?
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
So.  I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
But --
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer:  Why would they send me back without proof?
I don't know.  If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one.  It was still searching for meaning...
I'm not sure...  Maybe it simply exists in the search for it.  Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks.  But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Hot damn, Drag. Tomorrow's Saturday. Another week almost made.
You never thought that's a heavy load?
Yeah.
No.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Go hard!
We saw the broads.
Luke, you run again and we'll kill you.
He ain't even got the sense to run from the road like everybody else.
Only two? Man, I already done eight. Nothin' to it. Just make the days and let the weeks and the years make themselves.
Borrowin' or payin' back?
Looka that! Two of them. Oh my...
Lemme see it!
Oh lookit that brunette.
Somebody say somethin'?
Whatta you so happy about?
Why'd you have to say fifty? Why not thirty-five or thirty-nine?
Damn, Luke. What's the matter with you? what's the matter with me?
What did I do? Stole and tole lies. I loved mah neighbor and his wife, but what did I do to deserve this lunatic to come in mah happy home and beat me outa hard earned bread.
What you talkin' about, Luke? We're together, you and me, just like always. Now the thing we gotta work out is how to get Koko outa there and then the Terrible Trio be all complete again. Man, this old Free World ain't gonna know which ear to stand on.
Luke. Where you goin?
Not a liar. You just have a common -- and likable -- tendency toward exaggeration.
All right now: get mad at them eggs. Eat it there boy! Bite it! Gnaw on it!
Man, it's so hot.
Cuter again.
Yeah, found one in this supermarket, keys in the ignition.
Picture's a phoney... Cost me a week's pay.
Koko, why don't you let one of these Newmeats take your broom for today?
He can't phone you unless the warden gets an okay from you.  Did you give him an approval?
Monsieur Andy, disapproves of my coiffure?
Are you staying long?  Shall I shut the door?  Make your coffee?  Make the beds?
Who are you?
I never hurt nobody...
You don't listen very good.  This break in -- I can call it a felony -- three strikes, and you got about sixteen strikes already, and you're in jail for the rest of your life, no parole.  Or I could see it gets forgotten.
No, that's still in my jacket I was wearing.  We were supposed to meet on the docks, that number 47 wharf, 10 o'clock Friday.  He's gonna hand me 500 bucks.
Where is it?
Daryll Lee Cullum, he wrote that book, he wanted the lady to have it.  They won't let him send it to her, so I'm getting out, he asks me to deliver it in person, he says, put it on her pillow.  It has all about how he tried to kill her.
She's supposed to have it.
I think whatever is best for you, Daryll.  And maybe you're right, that's the place.
How was Conrad supposed to find Kurten?
You've been perfect.  Don't spoil the symmetry -- you have to have a male cop.
Why did you do that?  Didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far?  I worshipped you.  You inspired me.  I thought you could understand me the way you understood the others.  I knew that about you -- the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.
Do you have any evidence to report, ma'am?  Do you know any of the victims...
Ring the gong, he goes.  Poor impulse control.
Why imitate a dead serial killer?
We'll show that to...
It's <u>anybody</u> connected to author- ity.  They write, they even knock on your door.  They're <u>fans</u>.  It thrills them to flirt with getting caught.
She was killed somewhere else and dumped outdoors in an empty lot. Where it says "no dumping."  Her legs pulled apart in a kind of sexual pose.   It's all different but it seems so -- the same. Artificial and <u>posed</u>... Something's wrong with it.
Who turned off the Internet computer...
Helen -- the killer directly contacted you.  His interest in you is <u>intense</u>.  I'm worried about you. I don't want to lose you.  I know this stirs up every monster under the bed, but this is the only direct contact we have with him. The only chance we have to trap him.  So, you can turn Internet back on, or I do, and we put somebody here on a 24 hour shift and you can kick, scream and hyperventilate.
He'll get caught.  If he has a plan that'll be what trips him up...
What's that siren?
They put  Merry <u>Saks</u> on it?!
Who's the married man?
The University computer is down for maintenance, but I've been going through my own notes...
How many do you need to sleep. Really sheep?
Helen.  I saw him die.  I saw him burning on the basement stairs, he never reached the top.
Are you always so bold?
He was in my apartment!
You've been very useful, Doctor, we appreciate all you've done, and now the professional will take over...
It's none of my business anymore...
Don't put yourself down like that. I <u>never</u> used you.  I worked my way up like a marine grunt!
Answer it.
Get Mercer to run the medical, dental, legal bills, laundry and dry cleaning receipts, extermin- ators, mailmen, grocery and drugstore deliveries, handymen, plumbers...
Snotty neurotic bitch...
Nada.  Lemme make the call.
You got a tape backup, yeah, here lemme copy it on tape...
Now listen up, Ruben.  You never, never, never mess with somebody <u>inside</u> the case!
The woman was in shock.  She was totally out on ranks.  I stayed because I didn't want her to wake up alone in a place where she'd just been under attack.  Stop that, you son of a bitch!  The place wasn't secure.  I was doing my goddamn job!  And, for the <u>second time</u>, I slept in her living room.
I'll talk to Conrad myself.  I'll be in the jail when you wind this up...
There was no sperm.
How about I put Nikko on it?
Oh, maaaaan?!
Christ.  How old are you?  You sure you want to be in this line of work?
Where you going?
I didn't want the Illigals, I wanted just the bastards dumping them in the harbor.  What's keeping those bums at Immigration?  Nightmare in here...
That was Bundy.  He killed forty of them, identical, long hair, parted in the middle, alike as Barbie dolls.  ...this is hopeless.  Let's try to get time for a police spokesman to appear on college radio and TV hookups and broadcast a warning?
Detective Niccoletti?
See, now you've annoyed her.  You know she doesn't like you to touch me.  Does she, widdle wee fing!  Wuhve you so much!  Did you feed her?
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
It's about time.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Isn't that rather too close...?
Oh yes. I thought he was a medical photographer, doing some sort of accident research. He wanted every conceivable detail about our crash.
Is this part of the act or are they really hurt?
You're kidding.
Do you live here? With Seagrave?
He must have driven through a pool of blood. If the police stop you again, they may impound the car while they have the blood analyzed. Vaughan kneels beside him and inspects the smears of blood.
Hello, Letitia. I'm Dr. Emlee, and I have some questions to ask you...
Patient.
What kind of place is this?
Do we have to talk about this?
The medicine's still bothering me. It feels like I have cotton wrapped around my brain.
I couldn't really say anything because of that fraternizing rule.
First you tell me to do what I want to, then you tell me to stop.
How?
Really?
How can I help?
That settles it. I'm never leaving.
Do we have to talk wedding details?
Oh, Ruthie, what am I going to do?
I was so sure. I really thought it would work.  We have plans, Ruth.
How wonderful, darling.  What does that mean for you?
Are you sure, Dear?
My goodness. A wedding.      My goodness.
Mom, please.
I gather he's late as usual.
I'm here, Sweetheart. I'm here. It's going to be OK.
Yes.
Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway.
I'm going to take that as an honest effort at being open minded.
No, 79. Sorry, this makes me nervous.
Chair, cup and ball.
How do you sort it--by lace and cotton?
What have you done with the ring?
Guess which hand.
For a price.
A small price.
Thanks.    Where've you been all day?
Why in the world did you let me start talking in metaphors? That's no way for us to break up.
You must have thought about it. Everyone does.
And we'd eat Spaghetti-O's in bed from the can.
John and Nurse Gates are waiting for you.
Tell me all.
Where to?
How can you not like the Top 10 List?
Not yet.
I bombed. It's either work in the office or nothing.
That's OK. We can call and reschedule in the morning.
You're going to miss the Top Ten.
What is it? Are you OK?
What?
Silly, silly, silly.
I guess we need to talk.
Like I've told you before I don't want you taking care of me.
What are we going to do?
Maybe we could just run away to Tahiti and live on the beach.
Actually, I need to review the deposition questions tonight. Maybe tomorrow?
But I thought if you don't mind, you could listen and see how I come across?
It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
Sure. Why?
Are you all right?
Have you been seeing another teacher?
It's a doctor, isn't it? That's unethical. I'll have him rung up on malpractice charges so fast his head will spin.
Of all the crazy things. I understood when you dropped out of law school. And during this whole mess, I've tried to be supportive. But, really, Letty, what can you be thinking?
How's work going?    Are you back at school?
The Superintendent was just getting ready to leave.
Believe me, I wish I'd understood what was going on. I've worked really hard to get better.
Agent Hadley.
Okay.   Okay.    I believe you.
You're fucked, Sami. You know it.   That's why you're here.
Too many people know about my involvement in this.
Uh... excuse me, but don't you need a warrant or something?
They left about a half hour ago.
Hey man, you can't do that!
Yes. We went to the address we were given and had to tie up the owner of the house who turns out to be some Mafia guy.
Oui.
Oui.
I thought I would accompany you to the airport to say bon voyage... and tell you that Marcel will be going with you.
Daniel. Listen I'm afraid there has been a big--
Why are you here?
And?
They're gonna be what?
Uh, no --
Oh Frankie, what's this I hear about your brother?
Why didn't you tell me about this?
Either you are incredibly brave, or incredibly stupid. Which one is it?
I've got to tell you, Mr. Bonanno, This guy's an idiot. How he's lived this long is a mystery.
We've got a lot of people looking for us. We'd just like to go home.
And for my help I would get what?
I only have your word for that.
For what?
You know what makes a good get away driver?  Being able to get away!
Yeah.   We just go home.
No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
We are being watched. Daniel grabs the binoculars and looks.
Bring me the scissors.
I thought they came with batteries.
That moron.
We still have to get out of here.
This is Zero.
We've got to be careful not to use our real names while we're in here.
It's not?
How'd it go? I don't know.     Daniel, how would you say it went?
What's he joking around for?    He's been shot.
No, that would have left me with nothing because all of you would be dead.
Does it really matter what I say?
Why haven't you turned us in?
We had a deal before you and your friends became the new poster boys for crime.
Tell me the truth Hector... do you think we'll find my car?
Everything.
And the other car?
Are you forgetting who supplements your income?
Yeah. I'll come down and make a full confession later. Right now, tell me what else you found?
The map said to go left.
What do we do?
No, I didn't.
You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.
They don't serve wine here.
This kind.
I don't know.     Maybe if we did just leave --
I knew this was a mistake! I knew it last night when you asked me to go along with this. I could hear that little voice in my head saying, "don't do it! Don't you do it!" Jesus, why don't I ever listen to myself?
Oh, man... this is bullshit!    You can't trust anyone these days.
This is a car. I think this is the best American car I've ever driven.
When we get to the next corner jump out.
I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.
How about Canada?
Going somewhere?
-- I want to be Elvis.
Why would they want us to rob the Mafia?
"Vase with twelve Sunflowers."
No.   It's mine.
Fuck you, grease-ball!
Mr. Zammito?
No shit?
How are we going to do that?
Holy shit.
And how do we do that?
You ever hear of jet lag?
Casandra. Old girlfriend?
Sorry.   I didn't mean to pry.
Sounds boring.
Who are you waiting for?
She seems pleasant enough.
Who are you?
Isn't it a bit too late to be out? You've brought me the sword?
Do you think you are a real master?
They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword.  Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun?  You, too, are responsible for that death.  Come with me.  You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat.  Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.
Hello.  What is your name?
In that case, perhaps we could be of assistance.
Please sit.
Li Mu Bai!  The famous warrior? Why would he give his sword to Sir Te?
Yes, I am.  But I prefer the machete.  Certain moves, however, call for a sword.
I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!
You know what I mean.  I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.
I've missed you.
Without the Green Destiny, you are nothing.
Give it back!
No more hitting on the head!  All this trouble for a comb?
I'm sorry... I guessed wrong.  I though you were a Han.
Don't send me back!
Keep it safe.  Return it to me when we are together again.
Do you remember the legend of the young man?
The mountain must be so peaceful... I envy you.  My work keeps me so busy, I hardly get any rest.
Why?  You're a Wudan fighter. Training is everything.
What was it?
Join me once you have finished.  I can wait for you in Peking.
Jade Fox?  Impossible.
So I shall avenge my master's death after all.
No, I'd already sent them home. You can blame me for losing the sword, but please trust that I'll get it back soon using my own methods.
What happened?
Save your strength.
We know who stole the missing item. If the thief returns it, I'm sure Sir Te will pursue the matter no further.
No mercy will be shown toward the murderer who turned up in Peking.
It's Jade Fox!
They're gone.
This is Li's personal sword, a great hero's weapon!  He is the only one in the world worthy of carrying it.  It's too fine a gift. I cannot accept it.
I don't know...
I beg your pardon.  Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.
We must be careful.  Governor Yu is a court official, and in charge of security.  Any disturbance will cast suspicion on him.  It might get Sir Te in trouble.
Sir Te, can you find some excuse to invite Madam Yu and her daughter?
He was a runner for Top Dollar. Just muscle.
Whatever it is, the answer's no, Eddie.  I'm too busy tonight.
Don't thank me.  Your ass is already in enough trouble for this shit.
Could be.
I know Top Dollar has turned your streets into his hell.
You, my friend, are dead.  I saw your body.  You got buried.
You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend --
It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy.
Mom --?
You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives.
I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours?
Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it...
Chili dog for breakfast... it's original.
I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star.
A year ago.  Halloween.  A man and a woman.  In a loft.  You helped to murder them.
Holy shit... you're dead, man...
Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air...
You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar.
I wish to possess what you have now.
Neither.
Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd!
Having fun yet?  No?  I'll give you a hint.  Remember whatshername?
Miss her?
Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we?
You'll be alone.
What... the hell is that?
That thing is poisonous.
Give me a break.  That guy's a wacko...
We've got company.
I've got him if you want him.
An unexpected pleasure.
I'm Kathryn.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
You promise not to say anything?
Got a boyfriend back home?
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
Oh really?
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
You've read The Fountainhead?
Romantic? He rapes her.
You need help.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
How's the water?
You're naked.
Need a lift?
And that's a bad thing?
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
I'm... I'm alright.
Okay?
What are you reading?
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Lighten up.
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
I just came to say goodbye.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
How am I a hypocrite?
Hi.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
But you knew this was important to me.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
Those are my letters!
Really? Bulimic headcase.
Are you for real?
See that wasn't so bad.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
What are you saying?
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Who is it?
What do you mean?!
It's like a secret society.
And then I can go home?
Just a kiss, right?
I think that's all the time we have for today.
Nudie pictures, what do you think?
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Positive.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
Sorry.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
You would not believe what--
What's wrong with you?
I'm at your service.
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Any day now.
You amaze me.
Shut up.
Morning!
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
Bad time?
You didn't?
Why so nervous?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
What about her?
Later. Listen, we're entertaining some guests so -
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
Did she show up?
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Wow. I never knew she had these kind of feelings.
Hey Ronald.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Oh, hello.
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
What song, dear?
Did your wishes ever come true?
Where did you get this ring?
But where did you get it, Amy?
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
She was very pretty.
Irena.
Gosh, in my day kids arrived at birthday parties before anybody was ready for them,
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
I called not only the Boyds but the Irvings.  Neither of them received invitations.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
You're shouting at me.
I haven't had my breakfast.
Where did you get it?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
Amy, you remember the party invitations Edward, gave you to mail?
Did you mail then?
Where did you mail them?
But I told you about that so long ago; you couldn't have been more than three when I told you that tree was a magic mailbox.
Now look, this is the last time you come to me with any such stories — I'm sick of this sort of thing.
Listen, darling. I want you to look once more. Take as long as you want. Look very carefully, and then I want you to tell me that no one's there.
My goodness, don't you open your presents until Christmas morning?
We open ours on Christmas Eve. That's considered proper.
I've wanted a friend.
I shall want you for always.
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
Can't you get it, darling?
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
That's right!
light shining) in her eyes) Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
May I pet the deer?
You?
But why?
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
Been crying? That won't please your Daddy. You'd bettor cheer yourself up.
You just wait until I finish here. I've got to dust these ships for your Dad.
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
But I only came to give back the ring.
I like stories.
Mommy read it to ne.
Hurry, hurry.
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
There's a present you haven't opened yet, ma'am.
It's dark. We'd better be getting on. The family will be waiting.
When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard.  I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
But there was nothing, no one in the garden.
Sorry about Frida. She's been friends with Jen forever.
No.
Yul Brynner. They're all dead.
What?
I mean body temperature. Do you have a fever?
Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may feel sharper if you're grinding them at night. You don't seem hairy to me. Is that all?
Jennifer?
Translation: a total geek.
I guess I have a weakness for him. It's those big brown Bambi eyes.
How about I give you a make-over? You'll feel better about yourself. You're actually pretty, you're just not bringing it out.
Can't you get contacts?
Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he's cute -- he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.
Why would they exaggerate?
What the hell is the tampon test?
You might want to tape your nipples down next time. It's really distracting.
And what makes you think you killed a man?
What happened to his tooth?
How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
What the fuck are we going to do?
"The female-cycle werewolf will only kill men and never kills someone she truly loves." See I knew you never loved Mark.
I'm cleaning my stove.
But how do I know if I really love Peter? And if he really loves me?
About Benito.
Never been better. Peter spent the night. I must really love him. He's still alive.
God I hope so. Hey can I call you later? Peter's still here. He's in the shower.
I'd really feel more comfortable paying for my half of the dinner.
You don't have to pee.
Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger. You owe me...
Wow.
How about a "Man in Jeopardy" story?
No.
Being a cop has such a warm effect on people.
Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me off.
Okay well. Maybe some other time. They continue walking together.
Cool. I don't get guys who wear boxers. My ex wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his boxers bunch up.
You sure? It's my favorite shirt, mind if I check?
Uh.... hi!
You had a date with Carlton?
Did I tell you I have the worst sense of humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?
That's it? Hell my mom chased my dad around with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name. She'd say, "You're talking to Betty now" and we'd leave the house for a few days.
You can't mean that. I'm sure your bark is worse than your bite.
Is that how you feel?
I did shave... Do I seem hairy? Peter laughs.
Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.
You at least owe me the truth.
We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
I'm going to take a shower.
Here's a towel.
No. We left the restaurant, and... and I felt sick... so... so I took a cab home. Alone.
No, I have a cat.
No he's not. He's a courier. He picks up packages from the airport.
It's for you. Frida.
I'm supposed to put up with a fuckin' cat I'm allergic to cause your friend's got PMS?
How the hell is that your business?
I was thinking about becoming a cop myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?
Nah, I don't wanna break up with Wanda, I just wanna see Carmen too.
Frida's sheets checked out fine. It was just her own blood. From her... you know.
Hey, there was a lot of blood.
Madonna's in Penthouse?
He was found nearly ripped to shreds in Central Park.
This is more than fishy, this chick dates a dude and he winds up dead.
Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
You think mafia hit?
It has to be Frida. This makes three guys ripped apart who are tied to her ass.
What are you talking about?
My girlfriend's predicting another murder in the next few days.
What kind of animal?
They don't speak English...
Police.  Nobody move.
I met a friend of yours the other night, doctor.  Tall fellow.  No hair.  Rather pale skin...
Please, they'll kill me...
What is this place?
Yes, sir.  I'm sorry...  But I don't understand how it was possible.  The only window was twenty feet up a vertical wall, he was cuffed...
Dammit!
Donít ever sneak up on me like that! Who are you?
Iíve taken the liberty and had Inspector Thompsonís office searched, as I believe you instructed.  All clear now, sir.  They found several more traps and things were filed under pretty strange categories... Poor man.
I need everything on the Jonathan White case.
Where are we going?
Why give yourself up?
I don't know who they are.
Don't know that either.
Where do you think this goes?
What now?
You see it?
Where does it lead?
A fanciful idea, Mister White.
A book of delusions.  Anything else?
Water?
If you like.
Horrible...
It's a trick.
What are you hiding?
What happened to you?
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
What the hell is this?
.. Nothing.
Just don't call him, Alan!
Look, everything can be handled.  We'll just find a way to handle it.
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke'  story...
Nobody's got clean kids.
It's gonna be great.  'Caring about his wife.'  'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
What do you mean by that?
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
I gotta tell ya, Dave.  I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up.  Who does these books?
Well, yeah.  But you gotta start making some choices.
You know -- priorities.  Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed `cause you wanted to get that piano?
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
Well,  let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital.  You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
In the car.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first.  You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
Presence.
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing.  Even I don't understand it sometimes.  Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
And it's proving quite effective...
Yes, it's designed to bolster individual confidence in a previous domestic automotive purchase.
Yes, but I wouldn't...
Mr. President, may I speak frankly with you?
The Fidelity nonsense...
Oh my God...  I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
You're not?
Really?
Huh.  You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
I was waiting for that jack.
Who?
Well...
What are you staring at?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
That was quite a thing you did today.
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
Where are you going?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
In fact,  I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
That's a secret.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
Well I guess...
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
I never thought I'd...
Oh yeah.  Did you take care of later on?
After hanging up there a few days you will be mad for food...crazed! You will lust for it! YOU WILL BE WORSE THAN ANY OF THEM!
I'll bargain with you. How many of you are on the island?
What is it?
I know it hurts. But it won't be long. Then all the pain will be over. Oh, I wish you could hear me. GOD, GIVE HER THE EARS TO HEAR ME SO SHE KNOWS I DON'T WANT HER TO HURT SO!
Well, Miss Henried, what a coincidence. You're just in time fer a case that seems ta concern you. Guess you didn't care about the other proceedin's we been dealin' with here this mornin'.
Sir. It's quite clear that...
Now I think Captain's punishment is fair, considerin'. In fact I think you ain't got shit ta complain about.
Bees. That's what we call the dead... the walking dead...here on Gasparilla's island.
Oh, what did I run into? A bunch o' Jesus nuts? Religiosos? Prayer won't stop a bullet from one of those storm troopers and prayer won't keep one of those monsters from eatin' your liver for lunch.
Let me go! I'm the one he wants. This is all happening because of me. If I turn myself in...
I'm gonna have this stuff sent over to the hospital...
There ya go. Complete with air canisters...little motors.
Oh, no. I'm tryin' to get off this island alive. I'll help you all I can but I'm not goin' in there on a suicide mission. What can you hope to accomplish? Some radios maybe? A supply room or two? You'll all be killed and in a few weeks they'll be back to business as usual. That place was built to withstand nuclear attack! What are you gonna do with a half-dozen guns and a few sticks of nitro?
This stuff really works? No shit?
Dios mia.
God has damned us all. Are my atrocities worse than yours?
If you put her on the shit list because of her reaction here tonight I'll go to Dickerson.
It's been fired.
Tricks...Jesus...
No relation.  Never heard of him. Sorry.
I'm in as long as we're careful.
I don't know.  I don't get it.
Yeah.
Yaa, I'm a dead poet!
Hey guys, why don't you show Tina the Dead Poets garden?
I here and now commit myself to daring!
Yeah?  Like what?
It's such a strange name!  Won't you tell us what it means?
No!  Anybody else would have jumped my bones by now but you're after my soul. Make me up some more poetry.
Welton Academy, hello?  Yes, he is, just a moment.  Mr. Nolan, it's for you.
Hey, I heard you went to summer school?
Okay, so I don't like it any more than you do.  I'm just saying
Charlie, That was great!  Where did you learn to play like that?
What are you going to do? - Charlie?
Chris.  We got it.  Let's go.
You fucked up little prick!
That's your sister school, right?
Well, sure!
carpe breastum.  Seize the breast.
If they catch you here, we'll both be in big trouble.
But I love you.
Of course I know you!  From the first time I saw you, I knew you had a wonderful soul.
Of course just like that.  That's how you always know when it's right.
Yes sir.
Oh Captain, My Captain.  What if we don't know anything about someone like Rahesh Non?
This was my first classroom, John, did you know that?  My first desk.
A sweaty-toothed madman
Well, if it's more than a whim, then you'll have to prove that to him.  You'll have to show him with your passion and commitment that it's what you really want to do.  If that doesn't work, at least by then you'll be eighteen and able to do what you want.
Give your father the benefit of the doubt.  Talk to him.  Let him see who you are.
What did your father say? Did you talk to him?
All right.  Jesus, what are you gonna do?
Where are you going?
But father, it's not fair.
You know me, always taking on too much.
Weird.
Want to come to the study group?
What?
Being in the club means being stirred up by things.  You look about as stirred up as a cesspool.
Neil, how are you gonna do this?
This is your desk set.  I don't get it.
Well, maybe they thought you'd need another one.  Maybe they thought...
Look, Todd, you're obviously under- estimating the value of this desk set.
Put more into it!
They are...they are everywhere.
This isn't right Finnegan. I've got a contract.
He did...with a crowbar...you know the rules on a broken contract.
Shut up! Shut up all of you! Now here's what we're doing... Mamooli is going to take you back to fix your engines, Chin and I are staying here to finish the job...
Who gives a shit about aft?
What other bunch?
Unless you collected on the insurance...
Noooo!
You don't have to be so touchy.
I'm not rich people.
Since I'm a kid, I had this dream... I want to own my own tropical island... Beaches, warm ocean, lots of food, little clothes...population of one...
The "come back" kind.
It's not them...it's it...
You want ME to go up there?
Three minutes...I'm not back...no matter what...you go...
Where's you friend?
Let's just keep going.
Here's what I think...I think these mokes below are a hit sqaud.
Don't shoot!! Don't shoot!!
Red cross over to blue double blue ...is that what it is? A squid?
You tell it straight or I pull the trigger. Who are you?
You know what my goal is? Before I die I want to make love to a woman from every country on earth.
What was that?
Hey! What are you trying to pull!
She fucked us both.
You just put mustard on your Hershey bar.
Damn right!
And we want you to know, Sal, that any help you might need--
Who's full of shit?
It's gotta be the next one. I mean it's gotta be! Right, Albert?
What the --!
Fuckin' guy's been shooting slants, Albert! I mean, what do you think?
Hey, Nick, I mean... This here is for the guy that gets caught!
Then what's the gun for! What's this for?
In case???!!! In case of what? In case you stumble on her, suckin' cock in the front fucking hall?!
I got delayed. I --
You're back.
Nick... Sal is very weak. He suffered a severe wound... and right now he doesn't want a whole lot of people to get involved in a whole thing.
I have to go.
No, I --
I have to go.
C'est tres amusant... You have been promoted. And to a Jew... I am joking of course. Naturellement. Seriously, Nick, may I hope that you have come to play?
Ah. Merle. And you know Merle?
You like to call me Linda now?
Wait! First I give you special fuck!
Get 'em! For Christ sake, get 'em!
Where's it gone?
But Sal's mother! What about Sal's mother!
That I must not tell you. Top secret. You see there. Topmost secret.
How's the trailer?
Frost.
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Nick?
Linda... Honey, what's wrong?
You can do it, Sal.
Sal... listen to me, Sal! You have to do it.
Humper's ready. Old humper's hotter'n damn hell!
Is he from here?
I love this fuckin' place... That sounds crazy. I know that sounds crazy, but I love this fuckin' place... If anything happens, Nick, don't leave me there. I mean it. Don't leave me... You gotta promise, Nick. You gotta promise me that.
What are you, hoping?
Forget Sal.
We gotta play with more bullets, Nick. It's the only way.
How's Linda?
I like it, Nick.
Not tonight?... You're not driving up tonight?
Don't worry what it says in the book.
What's that noise?
Wait a minute. Sal. Hold it. John Wayne's making so much noise I can hardly --
Sal, you're gonna die! You're gonna sit in that corner watching soaps and you're gonna die!... I'm not saying it's gonna be the same. It's not gonna be the same, but whatever it's gonna be we're all gonna do it, Sal. God damn it we are! We are gonna do it!
Oh cards, maybe. Poker... It's getting cold, Sal. I'm going to take you in.  We'll call Angela. The guys can help her bring you home... Did I tell you I was going on a trip?
How're you guys... I mean, how've you guys been?
Well, who'd you get married to?
Down I would say... What would you say?
Up a little there... What would you say?
No chance.  Not their sector.  They ain't even into things this big. Our zone-boy's performing out of a horror show.  Something else.  Unit nine found a couple cold ones in Hollywood.  One Manny Turner.  Gun runner. Sounds like a connection to me.
Mr. Murphy asked about you again at work yesterday.
Speak up.
Give it to me.
Hello Wade.
I'm wasting time.
What is it?  I'm about to go on.
You have no evidence.  Arrest this man.
What do you mean he's escaped?! They're not supposed to escape!
Just great.
Sir, your dinner with the union leaders begins in an hour.  Your wife will meet you there, so we can leave whenever you're ready.
You okay?
Okay, that's all folks.  Commissioner Gallagher has to go.
You sure?  I can help you.
You my partner?
I'm ready.
Give me a break.  I'm serious. What's it like to be dead?
You're saying you were put away for a crime you didn't commit?
It doesn't make sense.  Who would want to do that to you?
Yeah.
I'll have a cup of coffee?
You want to be a good detective?
I'm just doing it by the book. Analyze then vaporize.  Crime's a science.  Everything's analyzed.
What's this?
So, he's got a thing for prison clothes.
You okay?
I just heard.
You should be in hospital.
Jesus, Sanchez... what do you think you're doin'?  That's flatfoot data. You're not supposed to have access to that.
But he was such a good cop.
You all right?
Seat's too high.
William Simpson.  I like Willy.
Papers.  Last Medcheck two weeks ago. A-1.  Disease free.  Guaranteed by the State.
Golly, Belle, that was a good idea -- we should do that every morning.
What are those people doing there? What do they want?
Who are these people?
Jabez -- ?
I see why you're here -- you knew that nobody was coming.
No -- but I can hardly wait -- Mister -- tell me, will there really be --  -- a man that eats fire?
'N Daniel Webster will be there.
I think I'd like to begin with the fire-eater --
What's that, sir?
But it didn't stop. I know it didn't stop. Granny told me it didn't.
Lan's to goodness, what happened to that hen? Did you use that beanshooter again?
Kin you spare a moment for me Jabez?
Say ... about the interest ...
Are you one of old Stevens' customers too?
I am just thinkin' -- now they mightn't like the idea down in Washington.
Stevens!
Now run along, Daniel.
Almost seven.  No -- no, he's not seven yet I am sure --
Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
All right -- so it's buried with you!
Huh? -- What's that?  Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
Do you deny that you called me? I've known people in other States who went back on their word. But I didn't expect it in New Hampshire.
Yes, why shouldn't it?
What does it mean here -- about my soul?
No, no! Give it to me!
Why, Mr. Stone, you look so worried. Can I be of any service?
.... Miser Stevens' soul, Mr. Stone. Yes -- I am sorry for the disturbance.
Trying to break our contract again, Mr. Stone?
Oh no, you violated clause five of our contract and I could collect right now, if I chose.
Suddenly you seem quite desperate, Mr. Stone --  -- You know I'm a good-natured man. I'm always open to reason. With a little security -- I might--
Well now, Mr. Stone, did you make up your mind?
Yes -- yes, I am the richest man -- too rich. I can't think of anything but money. That's the trouble with me.
You win. Will you ride to the village with me, Mr. Stone?
Why -- good morning, Squire.
Ahem -- we want to have a little confidential talk with you, Neighbor Stone. Don't like to take a man away from his planting -- but sometimes --
Yes  siree -- that's the idea. Get them all here and then say: "Look, folks -- here's Daniel Webster, my guest of honor." Golly, I can see their eyes pop already.
Now, Squire, you're not going to let me down. We still want to do a lot of business together, don't we?
That's fine. Now you can tell people all about the house, but don't mention Webster.
Yes -- I had to pay the vet in full. He just wouldn't have treated the horse this time. After all, we can't very well do without a horse.
To save us work on the spring plowing?
Mary -- what would you do with a pot o' gold?
But it's not very becoming to you to have your hands in the suds -- when the Squire and his wife --
What happened.... Where are you taking him?
But Jabez, I never said that!
Mary! Come back ...
How'd you know to have the calf ready, Ma?
Yes -- and you figgered right, consarn it!
Helps sometimes to say it.
Well -- that's comforting!  Supper.
Queer sort of weather we're having -- queer like everything else.
You see, son? I'm old and I've lived. When a man gets his money in bad ways -- when he sees the better course and takes the worse -- then the devil is in his heart -- and that fixes him.
What's that you say, Son?
Ma -- is she? --
Hello, Sheriff.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
What are you looking for, Colonel?  What's your name?
Well -- she hardly ever comes here -- she's not the type of woman who cares to live in the country. Yes -- I'm all on my own -- sometimes it makes you feel a little lonely --  Do you mind if I indulge?
Yes, you've chatted a lot, woman-like nibbling around the edge -- But, Mary, forgive an old lawyer's legal mind, I don't think you ever once came to the point. And there is a point, isn't there?
Your spirited efforts on behalf of your clients do you credit, Mr. Webster -- If you have no more arguments to adduce I'll take him along now.
And who with better right? When the first wrong was done to the first Indian, I was there. When the first slaver put out for the Congo, I stood on the deck. Am I not spoken of, still, in every church in New England? 'Tis true, the North claims me for a Southerner, and the South for a Northerner, but I am neither. To tell the truth, Mr. Webster, though I don't like to boast of it, my name is older in the country than yours.
You mean -- a jury trial?
My congratulations -- as between two gentlemen.
The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front.  So, your lady live out here?
Closer to Japan.  You're fast.
'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move.
I'm Special Agent Johnson of the FBI. This is Agent Johnson...no relation.
-- ten blocks?  Are you crazy?  It's Christmas Eve, thousands of people -- the Mayor'll scream bloody murder --
Hans, he killed by brother --
Bad for your health anyway.
Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there?
Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
John!
Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty.
I hear you...  Partner.  And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay?
Al?  Al, you there?
Speaking of cows, did you ever hear so much bullshit in your life? Two hours?  That doesn't even make any sense --
Yeah?  What's the odds?
I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge.
A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID --
Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them --
You'll be okay.
I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one- year-old kids.  It's ridiculous. I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it!  Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never.  I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river.
...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places!  And I let myself get fat.
I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny?
Maybe we can take something smaller... like a Spanish grocery.
It looks like a whole roast.
What guns?
I'll kiss the baby for you.
Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed.
No.  Look, we're kind of....
Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out?
Denmark?  Sweden?
Would you do something for me? Please?
I can't survive in prison, Sonny...
Yeah.
Yeah... I knew it.  But, what choice do I have?  I'm in the hospital; they drag me out of the hospital... bring me down here...
Yeah... yeah!
Well... I don't know if I have or not.
Well, you got to get hold of yourself.  You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up.
You try calling the police?
Somebody's got to stop him, Leon.
Yeah.
Who's this?
Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay.
You alone, or you got confederates?
Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name?
You frisk me.
He wanted to kill me!
I want a helicopter to get outa here!  And a jet to take us to...  ... wherever we want to go.  Outa the country, so no little jets.  A big one with a bar and a piano lounge.
What the hell you doin' back there?
Bullshit ... I don't walk to talk to you ...
Yeah?
Is he all right?  Is he all right?
I must of been outta my mind.
This is it?  What am I gonna do with this?  Holy shit!
Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites!
Where's the back door?
To what ... learn how to shoot? They don't get a gun.
What if I take you with me?
Do you think we can turn it on?
I'll never see them again, Mister Mulvaney.
I didn't eat any pizza.
Ah, Sonny!  Good luck, you know?
Did you know he was a homosexual?
Did you always call him Junior.
I used to, but I stopped.
Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole...  He can't make it.
We won't have to.
He wants one.
To show that we're negotiating.
Okay, Sal ... what do we do?

Sal?
Bullshit!
Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive.
At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out. Except one.
Oh - Maria!
You did what?  Who did you talk to? What for?
We can't stay here.
Not now, Mom, please.
Why are you doing this?
Robbing a bank.
Newsman, not ...
And if you can't deliver them?
This is Bishop.
Who the hell is that?
Alright. Time to ditch this thing. Did you take a look at the bathroom window?
Anything to get the fuck out of dodge.
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
<i>You drove Lateesha's daughter to school... then dropped her off at the DMV. Why?</i>
<i>The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.</i>
<i>Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.</i>
Cunt.
How did you meet Choco?
<i>I was asleep in mum's guest house.</i> <b> INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT </b> Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Everyone... please give Domino her space. Step back, please!
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
What did he say about the arm?
We're late.
They need to get the introduction on camera. Just play along, alright?
Listen, dick-fuck. I had a good run while it lasted. Now I've got ten million in the bank. <i>I'll never have to work again for the rest of my life.</i>
We didn't sign on for this shit.  Fuck! This shit is intense. I need to call my agent.
Fast and or furious.
Where is Domino?
You were good.
How you be?
Talk to me.
I'm gonna leave now.
So?
Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
Mookie.
No, you the man.
That was a foolish act, but it was brave.  That chile owes you his life.
Good morning.
Where did you sleep?
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Fifty cents.
Wake up?  Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Do me a favor.  Go to work.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
Hurry up and get dressed.
Jade, I don't want you coming in here no mo'.
Fool, you're thirty cents away from a quarter.  How you gonna get a boat?
It's dug.
Korea man is OK.  Let's leave him alone.
Sal, can you do me a favor?
Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
Mookie, I always liked you.  Not the smartest kid, but you're honest. Don't make me dislike you.
Ya just got paid, so leave me the fuck alone.
Doctor, this is Sal talkin'.
Doctor, always try to do the right thing.
Delivery from Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
I've been working hard, getting paid.
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
What?
Feels good.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Act like one then.  Be a man.
Shaddup, Vito.
Give dat bum a dollar for sweeping our sidewalk.  What do we pay Mookie for?  He don't even work.  I work harder than him and I'm your own son.
You talk to 'em.
Smack him back.
Mister Señor Love Daddy is cool.
Whaddup.  Money?
That's the dope.
See, Pop.  That's just what I was talkin' about.  Every single time you tell Pino to do something, he gives it to me.
Fuck you and stay off the phone.
Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I'm listening.
You really think so?
Be on guard.  Mookie has Pop conned already, so we have to look out for him.
Turn it off.
Couldn't we sell this and open up a new one in our own neighborhood?
Take it easy, Pop.
Yeah, we're closed. So go away.
Hi.
Oh Harry, you're so funny. Now I have something that's kind of delicate...
Sit down, I have something to tell you.
HARRY? Are you okay?
What are you wearing?
Uh... not a great first impression... Dinner's ready.
We've got some margarine too if you'd like to scoop it out of the tub.
You're going to be just fine, HARRY.
Oh, Harry, I'm so proud of you making a real friend.
No, that's not it. Anyway -  LLOYD Christmas.
Yeah, dangerous cult. Don't make eye contact or they might talk to you.
Oh my gosh, I don't think she's even wearing underwear!
You know, you're the first person I've brought here.
H A R R Y...
...oh also, we even have a slogan. 'S' and 'P' stands for 'Special People', which is the kind of kids we are. 'A' and 'Z' is for 'Aren't Zeros' because that is less then one, and when you put it all together it spells...
Wow! It's a half-boy, half-horse. The boys walk up to him, impressed.
Oh, yeah. Well I almost always beat Captain Rob.
No! Captain Rob is seven feet tall, wears an eye patch, got a hook for a hand...
What? No no. He's got a parrot on his shoulder, buries treasure...
If he heard you talking like that he'd make you walk the plank.  Three, two, one. Now it's your turn, spin.
Don't use that tone with me, young man.
Collins is a great man!
These are really cold, huh?
There she goes, now wearing nothing but her underwear.
She wants me to stay for dinner, I don't know what to say to her.
Now what are you staring at, you ugly monkey?
Did you hear what I said? The treasure! Like on your map!
JESSICA and I are through. I couldn't stand being with her knowing you liked her. It wasn't worth our friendship. Oh, and she also has a boyfriend.
No one knows?
By the way, did Captain Rob mention how I beat the crap out of him this afternoon?
It's okay. I want the rush.
Hey, look. Ice cream.
You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
I... found that rock.
HARRY, we found the real thing to be thankful for. Screw George Washington!
Sorry, Charlie.
Beats me. It's Jessica's Dad - she said he's really anal.
So what did you say to my parents on the phone?
I'm going to ask you one last time and if I don't get an answer, I don't even want to think about the consequences which would be frightening to say the least. Where's my chest, Jessica?
TURK, what are you doing here?
Well I was born in St. Louis.
Where'd that come from? He holds up a giant key chain.
So could you get us into the principal's office?
No, it was a complete waste of time.
That's my boyfriend.
He's going to be in jail for a long time.
Do I know you?
Oh my God, it's really you. You're HARRY's friend, right?
What? It's nothing, the cast comes off in six weeks.
Wait a minute. I can spend the whole year in a class taught by the lunch lady? Can I bring my girlfriend?
Sure.
Hey you two. Lights out.
Have you got what I want?
How was that?
What are you crazy kids doing in my tool shed?
Sorry, Ms. Heller. I think they're used to me teaching.
Left here! Left!
Ha! Too big to make the turn!
Well you know Detective, he's expecting  'Moffit' to be someone who has... certain... well...
You know honey, I've finally figured out a way of bilking enough money from the school to get us that condo in Waikiki.
You said "aloha" twice.
Times two.
Knock knock.
So what do you keep in there?
Everything?
Baby, I'm going to spend the morning at the mall. You know, shop for Waikiki. Honey, what are you looking for?
Yes?
Yes, my Lord.
We have just folded space from Ix...
Yes, Sire.
What's gotten into Gurney? He's not faking. Paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. The smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and SPARK off one another. Paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads Gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin Gurney against the table top with his blade right at Gurney's neck.
Don't you trust your own eyes.
No, but many consider my training valuable.
Do you know this my lady?
Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam. She is going to... observe you...  Please... -- REVEREND MOTHER Jessica, you know it must be done. I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of peace.
He knows.
It's further than I thought... a worm is sure to come....  I'll plant a thumper, that should divert it. -- Paul moves off into the shadows.  Suddenly, Jessica SEES a burst of LIGHTNING illuminate the mountain of rock in the distant and the vast dunes before them.
What's happened?...  Why did it leave?
You've worn a stillsuit before?
Will we see a worm?
Long live the fighters!
What's in the box?
It burns.
Did they try and fail?
Excuse me, Mr. Lugosi??
No.  I don't work here.
Who are you?  What do you want?
I am getting tired.  I need to take my medicine.
Are you sure this is okay?
Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
You're right, Bela.  Now Dracula, <u>that's</u> a part that takes acting.
Sure.  Romance, that's great!  To engineer your comeback, we're gonna need a whole slate of pictures.  Once "Glen Or Glenda" takes off, we'll slam you into one, then another, then another!
"It is my home."
"Dear, you are a woman of super strength and beauty.  A lovely vision of exquisitely beauty -- shit!"  Damn!  Eddie, I'm sorry I can't remember all this.  I'm an old man. It's too long.
What is this place?
Was I wrong to cast Loretta?
Let's shoot this fucker!  Where do I go?
Goddamn, it's cold!
Okay!  How do we turn this thing on?
Buddy, I don't know if that's such a good idea.
Bela, I'm on your side.  C'mon, give me the gun...  If you give me the gun, I'll make you a drink.  What are you drinking?
Bela, they're parasites!  They just want to exploit you.
I've got some good news.  The doctor says you're all better.  You can come home.
So Eddie, don't we need a sound crew?
And, cut...
Last night was quite a romp.
Which one <u>is</u> the red one?
Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
I got the early edition!  It was just dropped off at the newsstand.
Wow.
There's no such thing as a psychic. People believe my folderol because I wear a turban and a black tuxedo.
Incidentally, you <u>promise</u> you're not going to scratch my car...?
We thought Mr. Lugosi was insured though the Screen Actors Guild.
Eddie, I don't understand.  Why are <u>you</u> the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Huh?!  Oh, uh, no, I didn't get the job. But something <u>better</u> happened!
No!  A horror movie star!
Jesus Christ!  And you never told me?
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Don't get angry at me.  Maybe you just need a day job.
It was the only way I could get the movie made!
But there's plenty of other parts.
Maybe if you'd come to the backers party, I would've gotten the money.
I'm going to my mother's.
Eddie, what's <u>my</u> motivation?
Yeah.  Well I need the other sixty-thousand.
Yeah?  Well now he's a junkie.  He don't deserve to work.
Really?!  Well good for you.
What'd you give him all the lines for??  He's unintelligible!
Glad you could fit me in your schedule.
Edvard!   I haf question 'bout script. My vife Greta, she read.  And she no like.
Here's the scene.  Loretta, you're in a trance.  You glide in and get on the operating table.  Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down.  But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
Hey!  You're not eatink.
Tor, I should be getting home.
I can't believe it.  These sound like <u>my</u> problems!
Mr. Weiss, I was thinkin' about what you said, about how all your movies have to make a profit.  And I realized, what's the one thing, that if you put in a movie, it'll be successful??
Eddie, you must have me confused with David Selznick.  I don't make major motion pictures.  I make crap.
What if I told you you could have a star for $1000??
I thought this was gonna be a sex- change film!
Yeah!  Five pages right before it ends!  The rest of the show is about some schmuck who likes angora sweaters.
<u>Then how's it gonna get in the</u> <u>picture</u>?!
Because I can't sell it to save my life!  You made a goddamn feathered fish.  Is it an art film, a horror show, a hygiene flick?  Nobody knows! I'm beggin' people to book it.
What are you making?
You look beat.
He's better.  Thank you for asking.  How's your friend?
What was that?
I might as well be.  I made shitty movies that nobody wanted to see.  I blew it.  All he wanted was a comeback... that last glory...
But it's pouring.  And the car top is stuck!
Excuse me, Miss Vampira?
Look... would it be possible to make the "Ghoul's Wife" a little less prominent, so people won't really notice me in the movie?
<u>It's uncanny</u>.
Uh, yoo-hoo.  Excuse me!  Sorry to interrupt, but I got some big news.
Hey.  This is looking good!  Paul, where's the octopus motor?
Norma, this is Bela -- Bela, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Tor -- Tor, this is Norma.  Norma, this is Paul Paul, this is Norma.
Why... yes.
I suppose.  It's very expensive.
My goodness, you're embarrassing me.
What the heck is THIS?!!
No, no!  I like girls.  So how 'bout Friday?
What do you love her or something?
What?!
Her. That look. She likes the Ed guy better than she likes the brother.
Ed, can I see you a second.
Uh-huh?
Yeah?
Leave her be.
Ed --
He's who we want to go with.
I polled my staff. The men say they'd hang around with him and the women say he's fuckable. And one of the men said he's fuckable.
Where are you going?
According to your mother. When the paramedics got to the hotel, she told them that --
What?
You know who we are?
We're the guys who clean up after the parade.
No.
Ma, do you know where Ray is? I've been calling him and I'm getting his machine and --
How's Marcia? She all right?
Well, who knows? Maybe she finally picked a winner this time.
I told you the facts! He abandoned us -- those are the facts.
Yes.
Both.
Oh my God. You and Al were - and that's why you threw him out.
He's dead! Eddie, he's dead! It was his heart.
Don't tell Al. He doesn't know.
Hi. Is Shari here?
Well, Ed, that's ... not really possible.
Ed, look, uh... you're not getting the job. They're gonna transfer someone from another store to manage this store when I leave to manage the new store. I'm sorry.
Yeah...
Why do it?
Oh my God.
Go!
Oh God, this is so weird.
So...?
Everybody hates me!
A poll. "Is Shari Good Enough for Ed?" Seventy-one per cent said "no."  They hate me!
Twenty-nine.
I feel like a criminal or, like we're cheating on someone.
What do you want me to do? You want me to quit the show?!
What's up?
That! Being that guy. Being the guy they watch.
Show business.
You would do this? You would actually --
Whenever you ask me something why do you always say "Let me ask you something?" Why don't you just ask me?
How many opportunities are you going to get in your life?
All right.
Polish acrobat.
Ray, maybe this isn't ...
What is this? What's going on, who is that?
Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop?
What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me --
Cliff left her, thanks to you.
And each contestant gets one of these.  An "I tried to screw a network executive" tee-shirt.
Hi, Shari.
Hello.
You don't recognize me.
The last two years, I've been a limousine driver, but I don't see well anymore, so...
All right... This is my father, I don't know what the hell he can do, but if anyone out there can help him -- get him a job - I'11 ... help you. I'11 ... mention your business or ... I don't know, we'11 figure it out.  I gotta go.
Oh, yeah, I love those. Yeah... those are funny...
Why don't you come over. And I'11 make dinner. And you bring a movie. And ... We'11 make a night of it ... okay?
Look, my life is not so great, that I want it shown on television. And neither is yours.
What would I actually have to do to get you to sign this?
Tu
In love?
But you haven't written your novel.
what?
Tracy, I've been watching you for going on two years now, and I think you are one of the most talented, hard-working, sensitive, attractive, brilliant students -- no, human beings -- I have ever met.  I mean, you're the real thing.  Special.
You gonna do it? You gonna do it?
How'd it go?
Don't you smartass me!  Don't you dare smartass me!  You just shut your mouth I  Now your mother and I have had a long talk with Halt Hendricks  --- we just got off the phone with him at home. You know, he doesn't want you back at Millard.  He's fed up with you.  Fed up!  And I don't blame him!
What?
All right.  Well, sure nice to meet you.
He's right. Two people must have pocketed their ballots. Usually it's more.
Here they are.
Could you approve them now?  I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
Looks good to me.
NO, that's fine
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
Tim Kobza?  Tim Kobza!  Who's he? I've never heard of him!
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications.  I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down.  Did I do that too?
So what brings you here?
Handles pretty good, don't you think?
So Tracy?
Why are you doing this?
Coming to see me.  Are you trying to. . humiliate me?
Looks at her skeptically  doesn't say a word.
I don't believe you.
More this way.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
So what do you think?  Should we get a room?
points at the motel.
Three twenty-five.
Yeah.  I'm here.
253... 254... 255. I get the same as you Jim. Looks like Paul's our president.
What?
These are private -- these are for us.
Uhhh... teeth. Teeth.
Who put you up to this?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Yeah.
Can I sign yours too?
Yeah.  So guess what happened.  So Mr. McAllister, he --  Oh hi. Lisa.
How's the left these days?
Can I get you a drink?
Have you ever heard of Dick Stensland?
Yeah I know.  Patchett's running whores and judging by his address, probably something bigger on the side.  He doesn't want any attention.
I remember you from Christmas Eve.  You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job?
Did they deserve it today?
But you did it anyway.
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
Lad, may I have a word with you?
Captain, what do you want?
Will you work for me?
Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good.
Susie, I told you I didn't approve of that boyfriend.  He was too old for you.  You let him come into this house and be fresh to me.  I went out one day and old Mrs. Jensen next door saw Susan's boyfriend and another man and thought she heard a ruckus.
Where are we going?
A naked guy with a gun?  You expect anyone to believe that?
Dudley's guys.
Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules.
Let's go see Pierce Patchett.  Run a good-cop-bad-cop.
We had one thing figured wrong.  I don't think Dudley workd for Patchett.
They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two.
She's fine.
Officer White.  How about Susan Lefferts?  You know her?
Where's the other guy?  Buzz.
No, Mr. White.  Pierce Morehouse Patchett.  Now, I sense you're on your best behavior, but that's all I'll give you.  If you persist, I'll meet you with my attorney. Now, would you like Miss Bracken's address?  I doubt she knows anything, but --
Officer White.  I heard you got a hard-on for wife beaters.
Should I?
Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin?
Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now.
Cotton balls.  I found them just inside the meat locker door.
Exactly.  At least one of those animals had the brains to protect his ears.
Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation?
You're twenty-two, aren't you, Ray?
Ray, we got the shotguns.
You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  <u>You</u> were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good.
And what about the merchandise Deuce was holding for me?
This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell.
Ed, I want confessions.
It's a private investigation.  I fucked something up and I want to make amends.
I should've known.  What's the Chief throwing you?
You're playing an angle, college boy.  You're getting something out of this so you don't have to hobnob with the fucking rank and file cops who'll hate your guts for snitching.  If they're making you a detective, watch out.  Some Bureau guys are gonna burn in this and you're gonna have to work with friends of theirs.
Damnit... <u>What</u>?
Do you make the three Negroes for the Nite Owl killings?
High line whores.  With plastic surgery to look like movie stars. And who knows what else?  It's run by this guy Pierce Patchett.  You want to talk to him?
She is Lana Turner.
What's on the call sheet?
Decorated?
I get the idea.  You got a description?
Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley.
How about White?
I want to know why you see him. Is it a Patchett payoff?
I'll take your word for it.
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without --
That other policeman already checked under the house and found not a thing amiss.
My daughter was a virgin!
Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner.
Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus?
What happened with the kid and Loew?
He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat.
Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.'
Really?  How?
Gee.  The Great Jerk-Off Book Caper of 1953.
Yeah, Cap.  Back in Narcotics.
DePinto's dead.
It's actually DH-1 Digitech Pinpoint scanning with a frequency modulator.
Tired of chasing squirrels around the park?
Lemme ask you something. I put a bird feeder out in the yard, but the squirrels, they keep taking--
They keep taking the bird seed. I thought since you're the expert on--
Alright, I made a joke about squirrels, don't get so--
I'll come straight there.
It is?
Tell us about Rachel Banks.
Why don't you just call Brill directly.
I'm told you had an affair with Rachel Banks four years ago.
Yes.
I don't know what that means.
Why are they after <u>me</u>?
Why don't they just identify themselves and tell me what they want?
The price rises with the temperature and right now you're smokin'. But you're right, you should shop around and get the best price. I'll just let you out here.
What'd I tell you?
They can tap anything as along as it's an airwave intercept. Cellulars and pagers your kid can do.  Hard-line calls we'd pick off the relays as they were being fed into ground cables or fired up to the SATs. We'd suck in everything. All foreign, most domestic.  Domestic was my group. Druggies, radicals, loud-mouths. Anyone we wanted.
Meade has 18 underground acres of computers. They scan <u>every</u> phonecall for target words like "bomb" or "President". We red-flag phone numbers or voice prints...whatever we wanted. When the computers found something, it was bounced to comparative analysis.
It was '72. I figured we had enough problems without monitoring a Berkeley kid's class schedule. So I sold my story to <u>Ramparts</u> and split.
Empty 'em 'till they're almost flat. And turn your head. There might be some debris flying your way.
Think we let out enough air?
We lost 'em.
Fuckin-A.
These guys are incredibly persistent.
Drive or I'll blow your fuckin' head off.
Same thing?
I was thinkin' about asking for my hundred and fifty grand and calling it quits.
What if we hand deliver to their homes or office?
What if we transmitted it over cellular?
FBI, CIA, NSA, local cops.
With spy satellites. I don't like saying these things Senator...
Hey, Mr. D., what's happenin'?
That's fine.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
Remain calm.
Your stuff?
You weren't at Harrison's Department Store the night before--
Mr. Zavitz was in trouble.
We'd appreciate your cooperation.
Anything at all?
Uh-oh.
Yeah, but you said you've never met him. How did you--
I don't understand why Jerry couldn't clear this up.
He's got his priorities?
You told me you weren't seeing her at <u>all</u>.
I think you should leave now, Robert.
I know, but listen--
I know.
I wish you'd gone to your parents like I asked you.
I don't think anybody wants the drapes, Stacy, I think the drapes are okay.
I'm sorry I didn't believe you.
I opened the present you got me from Harrison's.
It's really over?
My suitcase--
What can I do for you?
You're goddam right you jumped the gun.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure I understand. You wanna fuckin' <u>what</u>?
And then what?
Do you like fish?
Ten thousand cash. I don't know if it's Brill's prices going up or your commission.
I <u>like</u> our history. And I like you. I'd probably like <u>Brill</u> if I ever got to--
I know.
My firm'll represent you. Free of charge.
This conversation's over.
If he passed me materials, I'd have them. I don't.
Jesus! What?! You want money?!
I don't <u>know</u> you, I don't <u>know</u> your name, I don't know <u>what</u> the hell you did for me except hang up on my wife and slam me into a wall, but I'm getting pretty fuckin' <u>sick</u> of this! Get it?!
Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
You're learning a cruel lesson.
It's okay to use the phone.
No, but they took my blender.
Can I talk to you a second?
The Congressman's very happy to have your support, but he's heard that there's an investigation.
It's the NSA. They're the ones doing this.
I don't know. I mean--
Jerry--
You gotta--
I'm sorry, man.
Tell me about it.
Was Zavitz in trouble?
You think there was a connection to--
What is it you want?
It means who's side are you on?
What?
The originals?
Who?
We'd have to--
He's clever? He had help?  Oh.
We found two sets of latent prints in the rubble of Brill's studio. One was Dean's. The other, we believe, belongs to Brill.
Yes sir.
We think it was on Brill. If it was, it's destroyed now.
Yes?
Do I look like I want a tiny pizza?
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
You felt obliged to.
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
Actually, you sing.
When were you most happy?
When were you least happy?
What do you hate most?
I can still taste you.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
What?  What?  That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Katharine!  Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
It's so cold.
Oh dear.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
It's Geoffrey under this.
Good morning!
I was talking about the girl.
I believe I'm rather late.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
Had a letter from my wife.  The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to.  She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever.  Wrong coast I should have thought, still…
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow.  I'm going to do what I can, but…  And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
We didn't care about countries. Did we?  Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans.  None of that mattered, did it?  It was something finer than that.
Hey!  Hey!  Stop this jeep!  Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Fritz?  What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
Is this you?
Or was it Toronto?
What do you want?
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
Ask him.  Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
Irving Berlin.
Top Hat.
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy  I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat -  how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession -  - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
The team is in mourning, darling.
Right.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds.  As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room.  I can smell it.  The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth.  I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint.  Is there sand in my eyes?  Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
Excuse me -
This is Captain McGann.
Something smells so rich.  My stomach is heaving -
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire…  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
For my hair?
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
What is this business with you and explosives?  Do you think you're immune?
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
It's what I've learned.
Hello.
I was looking for the Lieutenant Singh.
A bomb.  At the Viaduct. She closes the door, then reappears.
You've got to cut, sir, that frost won't last.
Yessir.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk.  And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
They're excited!  They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City?  Never!
Am I being interrogated?  You should be trying to trick me.  Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur.  Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted.  Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
Meaning--
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
I have a question...
I can't?
How about if I try humility.
Mr. MacDougal.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
You have a car?
Seems I am.
I've got something...
I didn't expect you to be so...
Do you mind?
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
The Empress Death Mask.
I know.
And good morning.
I know it well.
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
Let's do it again.
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
I trust it's your size.
You were afraid of heights?
Camera in the--
Popup, on floorboards. And--
We're working.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
Your share.
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
The Mask. Where is it?
What about the rules?
Well...What are we doing?
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
So how long till we do this?
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
Not for me.
The sign of our partnership.
Put this on!
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
She's calling the shots now.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
My friend, you always surprise me.
Mr. Masry, before you go off on some crusade, you might want to remember who it is you're dealing with here.  PG&E is a 28- billion dollar corporation.
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor.  Jesus.  Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
Meningitis?  What the hell is meningitis?
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
Cause of the chromium.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
It's a good day.  I feel good.
The judge came up with a number.
I can put them in a good school.
And get someone to help around the house.
Jane's the office manager.  She handles payroll and petty cash.  But she leaves early on Fridays.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
You're a girl.
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
What are you doing here?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
This is the only thing you found?
Hunh-uh.  Absolutely not.
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
What do you mean?
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
Oh, Jesus.  You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
And if you had to guess ...
Ho - ly - shit.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
Who's the judge?
I've also been thinking about the team. Responsibilities, who should cover what --
Well, it's pretty boring work, shredding -- you gotta find some way to entertain your mind.  So yeah, I took a look.
And you were told to destroy those?
Course as it turns out, I'm not a very good employee.
You come to the right place.
You just tell me what you want to look at and I'll be glad to dig 'em out for you.
Pattee?  That your middle name?
You're married.
Yes.  There's straight-up chromium -- does all kinds of good things for the body. There's chrom 3, which is fairly benign, and then there's chrom 6, hexavalent chromium, which, depending on the amounts, can be very harmful.
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
What's going on in there?
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
She's one of the sick people?
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
Annabelle Daniels.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
Which number do you want, George?
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
You're around every afternoon?
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
You are someone.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin.  There's a lot of jobs out there.
Cause I can get a job.  I will.  And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again.  Would that make you happy?
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
Yeah, you can.  You could just quit.  People do it all the time.
More than you need me.
Thank you.
And I miss you.
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
What?
Dr. Paulsen?
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Oh.  Oh.
Well, look, there isn't a ton of information here, but from what there is, I'd say that these two people here -- what are their names?  Shanna and Ashley?
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
Our pursuit ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, My Lord.  It has entered an asteroid field.
Soon, Lord Vader.
Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and found nothing.  The Millennium Falcon definitely went into lightspeed. It's probably on the other side of the galaxy by now.
... Luke, you must not go.
Three patrol ships are heading our way.
Barks a doleful farewell.
I don't care.  It would've been worth it .... for Han.
... Like we're being watched.
I'm looking for someone.
I'm looking for a great warrior.
Mine, mine.
I haven't seen him.  He probably came in through the south entrance.
What is thy bidding, My Master?
He's not a Jedi, he's just a boy. Obi-wan could not have taught him so much that ...
What are you so grouchy about?
It sounds like it's trying to get in.
Now all we've got to worry about is what attacked him.
This bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.
I know, I know, I see them ... LEIA See what?
You don't look angry.
Sorry, Captain, being held by you isn't enough to get me excited.
They're moving away.
What are you afraid of?
There's something out there!
Looks like some kind of Mynock.
I'm still not sure what you've accomplished.
What'd you have in mind for your next move?
A Tibanna gas mine.  Lando won it in a sabacc match, or so he claims. Lando and I go way back.
He found him in a junk pile ...
Well, I do trust him.  Lando's an old friend.  Must have been an accident.
I was worried about you.
That ship saved my life a few times.  It's the fastest hunk of machinery in the galaxy.  What's wrong with her?
How's your mining operation going?
What about Leia and the Wookiee?
What about Han?
Lord Vader has set a trap for him and ...
What's going on?
What'd you say?
Someone's falling.
The deflector shields are gone.
Closer?!
The Bacta are growing well.  The scars should be gone in a day or so.  Does it still hurt?
I can't. It's too big.
Concentration.  Heh?  Concentration.
I see a city in the clouds.
I see them! ... They're in pain ... they're suffering.
They're my friends.
There is much Obi-wan did not tell you.  Come, The Emperor will complete your training.
Seventeen ships destroyed, we don't know how many got away.
Did you call the Zoo?
The cigarette girl in New Vegas was an undercover cop. She injected you with incentive toxin. Right now it's swimming in your bloodstream. It'll start to take effect in 9 hours.
Who's that?
Ooww!
I tried...
Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.
Give it to me.
I think we've burned off enough fuel. We may be lighter enough to hover. Just barely.
No. The right skid's broken. If I try to set it down she'll crash. I have to stay in a hoverwhile you jump off.  Hey, Carjack. We gotta hide the girl. Give her your dress.
Shut up, Plissken.
Wait a minute, what are you talkin' about?
Defense against what?
By the way - who gives me the anti-toxin?
Not you?
Locked.
Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens.
Got a smoke?
It's the President, for Christ's sake!
Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.
Where are they going?
Not yet.
Later.
Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
Kind of a bad neighborhood, Snake.
Could be a big one comin' any minute now...
Long gone. You'll never catch up with him now, Snake.
You ain't doin' so good, Snake. You need help.  You should talk to Hershe. She hates Cuervo. They used to be partners, but they split up.
Who?
This is a dead end.  You took us into a dead end!
Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
What are you gonna do in Venice?
Get ready, shitheads. We're comin' in.
Yield. I have the advantage.
You are still the best knight in Christiandom. You gained a hundred advantages over me. It is I who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.
Lancelot, how did you fare in the North?
Hasn't Merlin mended your wound?
I want to thank you.
Excalibur! Is it true?
Yes.
What?  The greatest? They blend together like the metals we mix to make a good sword.
With all your powers, you are content to be ridiculed, laughed at...
Me? I have lived by the oath of king and knight.
What is this place, Merlin?
The Queen will be in my charge till a champion steps forward to fight on her behalf.
Why can't you be my champion?
I loved you much, as King, and sometimes as husband, but one cannot gaze too long at the sun in the sky.
Why?
Why didn't he kill us?
You left your husband's side? You left your brother's wedding?
It is.
It's clear you are, and it irks me.
When Arthur built the castle, I carved out a place for myself, where I could laugh or sleep, and no one would bother me.
You are truly magnificent!
You provoke me, Merlin.
I am the cloudburst that quenches the flames.
Behold the sword of power, Excalibur. Before Uther, it belonged to Lud, before Lud, to Beowulf, before Beowulf to Baldur the Good, before Baldur to Thor himself and that was when the world was young and there were more than seven colors in the rainbow.  Speak the words.
I have walked my way since the beginning of time. Sometimes I give, sometimes I take. It is mine to know which, and when.
Now you must pay me.
It's not for you, Uther, hearth and home, wife and child.
C'mon I can read for Christ sake.
That's right Mike. But he's finished and came back around three ot four months ago, He's in Woodstock now.
No, he's working on another book.
It must be alright. He's still running around digging up tombs. Besides, he's had experience.
You'd want to do the exorcism yourself?
Let's see whose around. In the meantime I'll call you as soon as I know.
And you got an invitation.
Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
You were expecting a deliver y that day?
Oh, I see.
Incidentally, just a chance in a million, I know; but your daughter - you could possibly ask her if she saw Mr. Dennings in her room that night?
I know that. I realize. But if a certain British doctor never asked "What's this fungus?" we wouldn't today have penicillin. Correct?
No. No rats.
There is nothing.
Excuse me Madame? Will there be anything else?
Morning.
A stimulant.
Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
Lies?
She used those words?
Hey do me a favour will ya'. Tell me something good.
She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.
Did he tell you about my party?
Didn't tell you of what she did?
On what?
Oh yeah, since when?
No I couldn't, I have to have church approval, and frankly, that's rarely given,-
Thanks. Look, I'm only against the possibility of doing your daughter more harm than good.
Like her speaking in a language that she's never known or studied.
Did you know my mother died recently?
No, is Regan aware of it?
No it's alright I'll take it straight.
Is she gonna die?
What kind of stuff?
Oh look at that.
Hey, where'd this come from?
It's not even a good picture. Looks to mature.
Well thank you very much but why on earth would I want to bring Burke on your birthday?
Course I like him, I like pizzas to but I'm not gonna marry one.
People get tired.
Over behind the church, you know where I mean over there, it's a red brick wing?
I believe you.
She seemed fine.
Another one. Had your lunch?
I see. Well then let's introduce ourselves, I'm Damien Karras.
If you're the devil, why not make the straps disappear?
You and Regan?
Did you do that?
Ydob eht ni mraw si ti! Uoy ees I! Tseirp a si eh! Emit su evig! Nirrem! Nirrem!
I am no one! I am no one! He is a priest!
No.
Do you want to hear the background of the case, first?
Save your servant
And also with you.
The Lord be with you.
Yeah, it's true. You do look like a boxer. John Garfield, in Body and Soul. Exactly John Garfield anyone told you that Father?
You this director was doing a film here, Burke Dennings?
Really?
Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.
Ah, doctor's ethics. If you knew you wouldn't tell, huh?
Answer the question, Father Paranoia.
Who?
MERRIN!!!!!!!
I cast you out!!! Unclean spirit...!
We want to see Mrs. Karras.
Yes
How old are you?
Is there someone inside you?
Is it Captain Howdy?
Give me the keys!
Frankie.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
What's our friend's problem?
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
You the magician?
Oh my God ...
Great.  Terrific.  Glad you could make it.
What's wrong with it?
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
You're their uncle.
What d'ya got?,
Seeing anyone in particular?
I'm not seeing anyone.  In particular.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
We gotta go, Jack.
You gotta go.
I made her nervous.
Yeah?
Nice, huh?
The hell you don't.
Bullshit.  Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
No?
I'm grateful, Frank.  How much? For the singer.
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna?  Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
Awe inspiring.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
Day.  Wednesday.
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
No! I never hear it!  Maybe.  Sometimes.  I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
What's the matter with you?
How dare you say you love me.
What the hell are you doing?
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her.  Makes me nervous.
You saw wrong.
Expensive hangover.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
That takes care of this week.  The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
What do you mean?
We're not getting paid then.
Seventy-one?  What's seventy-one?
What?
Is everything done?  The arrangements, I mean.
Right.
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
Oh, sorry.  I get so caught up in it sometimes.  It's scary.
You're an hour and a half late.
Just like that, huh?  You're not even gonna give me a chance?
So?
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back.  Good evening, Miss Diamond.  You're late.
Come on.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Right.
We are not a saloon act.  We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Jack, you with us?
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action.  Resort, upstate.
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
He's right.
I don't believe it.
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
Hey, we're connected.
Is that important?
Terrific, boys.  Really.  Terrific.
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
How come?
Brought it.
Yeah, yeah, I know.  I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
It went well tonight.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
Where's egghead?
Can't sleep?
How's egghead?
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
What'd I say?
You're upset.
You were good.
Nina?
She's four feet tall.  Ed?
Soap convention.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Vegetables.
Yeah.  The big boys sent it down yesterday.
Guess they're up.
My days are not the old days, genius.
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
So. How are you?
How's that dog of yours?  What was his name?
Waxy Wright.  Didn't Jon Archer bust you for poisoning five members of the Canadian parliament?
Don't they ever let us take these boots off?
I don't care -- he's manipulating it.  That bomb has been built and it's out there, somewhere.
Where am I?
You shouldn't have brought me here ... it's dangerous.
Yes ... someone might want to tear him apart -- snuff him out -- for revenge.
So?
Well, you tried.  You failed miserably, but you tried.
I'm late for surgery.
... I was dreaming ...
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis.  You need to seek the help of a trained --
I know you -- you're the one who called.  You're Castor Troy.  You killed my son --
I don't know that.  Maybe Jon's already dead.
I know Lazarro -- the first person she'd call is "me." We can't take the chance of tipping Castor off.
How is he?
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
Which ear was it?
One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
What -- what are you doing?
SFPD?  Castor isn't stupid enough to come back to the city.
Clarissa left those here.
Get a higher arc on the ball, Jamie.  And for Chrissake, square your shoulders to the basket.
Backing you up!  Didn't you track Castor to the Army Street Terminal?
Don't worry, nobody knows I'm inside.  Check it out.  Remember that fat fuck agent who roughed us up in Thailand?  He's being treated for bone cancer at the V.A.  Thanks to the miracle of NSA grid-technology ...  -- Ooops!  His radiation does just quadrupled.
We gut the organization -- and rebuild it with more reliable friends.
All of them do.  We'll kill twelve birds with one bomb.  And we'll be rich.
What about me?
Just following your example.
As much as ever.  Nothing.
What is with you tonight?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
Isn't that what all this is about?  Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
You always say that -- then you leave.
I'm late.  Gotta protect and serve the world, y'know.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
I'm going to the powder room.
Remember this from our junior prom?  Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
Her assistant?
You're right, Jack.  Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
Mr. Mintz.
That’s right. And auto supply...
Good for you. Why shouldn’t you protect what’s yours.
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner.  It’s throwin’ everybody off.  What do you think?
Look, you fit the profile exactly.  Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities.  You start thinking...this isn’t the life I dreamt about.  Where’s the romance, where’s the joie de vivre?  Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can’t have...
Damn...
Where’s your follow through?  Where’s your stance?
She is relentless.
C’mon, Evelyn Thompson’s got no class.  She doesn’t marry Dr. Steve, the woman’s living in a trailer.
Look, can I just borrow your car?!  I promise it’ll be returned!
How'd you know my name was Jack?
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
Okay, Jack.  Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
Miss me, Jack?
...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar...  Merry Christmas and shit...
You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else.  Next customer in line...!
Finger food...?
Evelyn, right?
Whoa, whoa, whoa...hold it right there...
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988.  Did you know that?
About four grand.  And a bottle of twenty five year old scotch from Mrs. Johnson in 9D.  I’m putting it all in commercial paper like you said.
Christ...  Where the hell is the bathroom?
Jack...
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
Uh...that baby’s crying...
Hey!  I was watching that!
Shouldn’t we grab some dinner first?  Maybe a bottle of wine...?
Thanks, Jack...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
How can you do that?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere?  I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
Good things...
I could stay here forever...
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
Annie goes to a great school.
You’re not married, are you?
Mrs. Peterson.
And sleep you shall. Noblesse oblige is not dead.  Not yet anyway...Come, let’s get you some help.  Surely there must be a shelter somewhere in this city.
I just got a call from Terry Haight.  Bob Thomas is nervous...
...we’re really more of a boutique operation, as you can see...
For one thing, you like expensive things.
It's Christmas Eve, Jack.
That’s totally see through...
I’ll go for a cup of coffee!
You don't know what it's like out there.  Walking around like some kind of circus freak.  People staring, whispering --
He <u>knew</u> about NASA.  What if he made the call to shut us down --
They crashed it into a wall.  A flight <i>simulator</i>.
I ain't done arranging your flowers, egghead.
How long was I out?
Are you alright?
Oh my G-g-g.  What did you...do to Ben?
What did you wish for, honey?
What do you want, Vic?
He couldn't generate enough power for the machine to reach critical mass. Yet another mistake for "Mr. Fantastic."
He's not responsive --
This is wrong in so many ways.
You need to control yourself and <u>think</u> before you --
And where do we think we're going?
I though we went over this.
Apparently I can disappear.
Stop it.
Wait.  You mean there's chance we could be full-on-24-7-fantastic?
Uh, we call my sister the invisible girl...the Invisible Girl.
Johnny?  Did you see Ben?
They're ready for you, sir.
Leonard, how's the feed?
Front page?
Funny how things turn out, isn't it?
<u>Ben</u> did this?
But I'm not done with the machine --
I, uh, think I remember the number.
Material made from self-regulating unstable molecules.  I've been working on a formula for this.
Which was?
What?
Sue.  Your clothes.  Lose them.
I'm saying, if you had a little more self control, you could locate the trigger.  Can you remember the exact emotions when --
Okay.  Is there any way to duplicate that feeling?  Some memory or...
I mean, <u>you</u> broke up with <u>me</u>, right?
There were a lot of variables to consider --
Which is why I'm working <u>twenty</u> hours a day, checking every variable --
It's been a good two years, Victor... The company's accomplished so much.
Victor, wait, slow down a second.  I want you to know I appreciate everything you've done for me, but I just don't --
Benes' natural defenses. White Corpuscles -- Antibodies. Once you begin to grow -- and become a menace to the body -- you'll trigger them off... MICHAELS With all the unknown factors in the body, I still say risking five lives for one is something we should reconsider --
Okay to proceed.
Doctor...without killing him -- how long could we stop his heart?
I know that. But what's the maximum?
<Cardiac Red Alert> we're stopping the Heart.
Time's up... We'll have to take them out immediately.
Benes... What the devil happened?
Cora Peterson, his Technical Assistant. You'll join Duval and the others --
They're bound to try again. No wonder they want me to stand by during the operation.
Wait a minute! They can't shrink <me>!
Listen...the Heart.
I can't imagine how it possibly could have come loose. I distinctly recall fastening it with all four bolts --
Doctor...
Air bubbles!... Doctor --
I understand you've been Dr. Duval's Assistant for quite some time... He must've snatched you out of the cradle.
A long time, with one man.
I never...never imagined it could be anything...like this.
That's why you're really here. I knew it from the start.
Oh, no. Plenty of cause. He won't follow the herd, or change his convictions -- even when they're not popular. And he believes in an absolutely free interchange of information between scientists of different countries -- and these days, there's nothing more suspicious than that.
But that isn't possible.
That puts us right here... Which means we can head straight for the Sub Arachnoid Cavity.
The Soul? The finite mind cannot comprehend Infinity. And the Soul which comes from God is Infinite.
--and certain chemicals involving proteins --
Don't tell me they're refueling...
Yes...  We can transfer over to the Inner Ear, and go by way of the Endolymphatic Duct.
They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
Miss Peterson, his Technical Assistant.
Sounds like heavy artillery...
At this size, I would certainly think so.
All right now -- push the snorkel through as soon as I get inside.
But that'll knock out our communications! We'll be cutting ourselves off from the outside.
Well, sir? Which is it? The wireless, or Benes' life?
Cough? If he can kick up a storm by just <breathing> --
I -- I don't know what to say. I know he's under a cloud, but there's not a more dedicated man in the entire medical profession.
I can't believe it. Whatever happened was an accident.
Hold it, Skipper.  What happens if we overstay?
Sorry we had to get you up at this hour, Mr. Grant.
That's cutting it mighty close -- for a perfect fit.
'Prepare for Miniaturization'...
Any reserve air?
I've come up against fanatics before, and Duval just doesn't fit the pattern.  I'm going out there, Skipper. Maybe I can be of some help...
What happened?
We feel great, don't we? Just <great>?!
What's wrong, Skipper?
Captain, how will you be able to follow my charts --  --from up there?
That's it...
I'll never find my way through that.
Well, that takes care of the valve. It was probably caused by that electric shock.
You, uh... I'm sorry, sir, but -
I'm sorry, sir, we do have to charge you the four dollars.
...Is this a fucking joke?
... What is he, deaf?... So, uh, how long have you been with the escort service?
Or your fucking wife, you know.
Yah, well, that was a mix-up, then.
Yah. But it's not a whole pay-in- advance deal. I give you a brand-new vehicle in advance and -
What kind of trouble are you in, Jerry?
Three people. In Brainerd.
That's right. And we need more money.
We need more -
DON'T EVER INTERRUPT ME, JERRY! JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!
Yah, I got the money, but, uh -
One hunnert's the best we can do here.
Any others?
That's wonderful. Mm-mm. It'll change your life, a course.
Oh, don't be silly.
Hiya, Norm. How ya doin', Margie? How's the fricassee?
You're not a C student.
...Yah, okay...
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
but do you know that for sure without -
Hon? Got the growshries.
Yah!
Yah.
Shep said 8:30.
Yah, how ya doin'. So, uh, we all set on this thing, then?
But we never talked about your fee for bringin' it to us.
- All's I know is, ya got a problem, ya call a professional!
They want my money, they can deal with me. Otherwise I'm goin' to a professional.  He points at a briefcase.
...Well, that passed.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
You look in his citation book?
Yah?
Yah, that's a good one.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
No, that's okay.
...What can I get ya?
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Nope.
Hello?
Yah?
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
So... they didn't...
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Hon?
They announced it?
I love you, Margie.
Uh-huh.
And his wife?
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
This is do-able.
What the heck, Jerry, if I wanted bank interest on seven hunnert'n fifty thousand I'd go to Midwest Federal. Talk to Bill Diehl.
I gotta tell ya, Wade, I'm leanin' to Jerry's viewpoint here.
I'm tellin' ya.
There's no one else here.
Yes.  We're men.  Men is what we are.
Is that your blood?
This is Detective Stern with the arson unit.  We have some new information about the "incident" at your condo.
It means it was homemade.
You need to lighten up.
We need to talk.
I'm on to you.  You're a faker.  You aren't dying.
And I saw you practicing this...
Look, I can't cry with a faker present.
I want that.
So far, you have four and I only have two!
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day?  I want ascending bowel cancer.
What are you doing here?
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
Where?  Here?
Here.
The Paper Street Soap Company.
He's not here.
What kind of stupid question is that?!
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Say my name.
Marla...
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore.  I just can't.  This is killing me...
... and you come home to this.
How have you been?
I had everything in that bag.  My C.K. shirts... my D.K.N.Y. shoes...
Tonight, we're going to open the green door -- the heart chakra...
Two, equal parts gasoline and diet cola.  Three, dissolve kitty-litter in gasoline until the mixture is thick.
Insurance'll cover it.
I don't... think so.
Yeah.
Thank you.
What's that?
A nice, big cock.
I don't know about this.
Alright, go crazy.  Let 'er rip.
Shit.  Sorry.  That didn't count.
We've crossed the threshold.  You want to call it off?
I know that.
Same here.
Where's your car?
What are you reading?
Unbelievable, huh?
Promise you won't.
Huh?
I... I think I understand.  I think I get it...
... Marla ... ?
I feel sick.
Is this a needlepoint club?  Is it about you and me?
This does not belong to us.  We are not the leaders.  We are not special.
What are you talking about?
"Applicant?"
And, we're definitely filling a void in the rural South.
You broke your promise.  You talked to her about me.
Why did you do that?
Is this really news to you?
The first rule of fight club is -- you don't talk about fight club.
Oh, yeah.  I didn't really know my Dad...
...stop me?
...to let this happen!
What are you doing running through the streets in your underpants?  We both use that body.
I wouldn't be doing that.  Unless you know which wires, in what order...
One minute.
This is the beginning.  We're at ground zero.  Maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.
Please...
What?
Why... why... why... ?
If I leave, you will be right back where I found you...
Now wait, there's been a mix-up. Everything's changed...
It's what he would have wanted, sir.
Would you rather be dead?
Yeah, how?
That's good.  Get all your tears out now, you'll need your eyes.  For the signs.
I was driving a white van.  It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned.  It was...horrible.
I can practically taste the water in my throat.  And something else.  The smell of flowers...
Are you crazy?  What makes you think you'd survive?
This makes no sense.  Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake.  Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested?
What do you want me to do?
No!  It can't be.
Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight.
Jury duty?  That's randomly selected by social security numbers.
Um, Clear?  I'm sorry...about before. I...
So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be alive in the first place.
I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign.
Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show...
A Trans Am.  That shit went out with New Kids on the Block.
Dano, shouldn't we stop and help your mother?
First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense.
I tried calling last night but your father --
Nora's not coming.  She refuses to leave her son.
This is cheery.
For God's sake, leave him alone, Dad.
This trip better be worth it. What's the guy-girl ratio again?
What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona?
Relax, you need to chill the fuck out.
The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18.
Thanks, Dad.  I'll call you.
Kimberly?  It's Dad.
What on Earth are they doing?
You're all certifiable, you know that?  I can't believe I've been listening to this crap.  Come on, Tim, let's go outside.
That's why I was there last night.
Ahhh! fuck! You fucking asshole. You think this is funny, you fucking dick? Tod, if you're not dead I'm gonna fucking kill you!
Can't you open the door?!
Get out! Get out of the car!  Get out of the fuckin' car!
You're payin' for my trip, Browning!
Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything.
We're losing our favorite teacher.
Man, that is one George Michael notch from being gay.
Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring.
And don't pass on the right.
Hey, man, why'd you say that?!
It broke!
Knock it off!
Sorry, I mean... I talk to people all the time... I know a lot of them aren't there.  But this is real, isn't it?  You're taking me home now?
This clown almost blew mission security on the street.  I'm not jumping with him.
Batteries not included.
Cocktail party.  Uh huh, right.  Let's saddle up.
I've seen worse places.
Why would they send us to a deserted camp?
Roundeye.
Torture cage.  Can't stand... can't sit... for days.  Sometimes weeks.
You never been in one of those things.
It's orders!  You remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it.  John Wayne is dead, man.
Why's that?
Why'd they want us?
Thanks.
Christ.  How'd you get here?
And how'd you sneak up like that?
Yes you can.
Alternate LZ Zulu Sierra at 0500. It says "May have heat.  Don't be late.  All our love."
You pathetic scum.
I don't work with spooks.  Not after that op in Cambodia.
What's the job?
Where?
Negative.  Absolutely not.  The phase two assault team will get them out.
I didn't know you were a stick man, Rambo.
All this is for us?
Typical...
How long have you been setting up?
Black.  No sugar.
Rambo and Brewer were selected as write-offs.
"Terminate with extreme prejudice."
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
Will it hurt?
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
<u>What</u>!
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
I... You're not going to understand this.
Hello....congratulations.
Well talk back.  He won't bite you.
What do you think?
What?
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Parry?
Yeah, I know the place.  It's one of those chic <u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.
No, Jack, no, it's not... She likes me.
No...no...we can't...we can't..
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
Isn't that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with...  <u>Raoul</u>?
Your name was picked.
Now what?
Oh, Lydia!
Please don't hurt me?
I need a drink.
Have I died?
Hi... Where are my shoes?
... I've got a right to say something.  I mean, you're tying my hands here!  They say you're not ready to know.
The Holy Grail?  Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
Parry.
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
I'm not married.
Why did you do that?
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
But I gave it to you!
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
Happily married, probably.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they gonna do? They can't do nothin!
Well, we have plenty of those.  Right over here.  We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
Don't say that.
I don't drink coffee...
No.
We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
Tell me what in the hell's going on, Elton!
Now, now.
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
Okay. Hope no one hits on you.
I know you're not.
Elton and Stoney know how I feel about you. An' they're just goin' to think I'm not too nice a guy, which I'm not, an' that you're a hell of a person puttin' up with me, that's all.
Bye, honey, I'll call you in a couple of days.
Come on.
Sure you don't want anything?
I had to leave this place. I got depressed, seeing all the crap. And the thing is, they're making more crap, you know? They've got so many stores and stuff and junk full of crap, I can't believe it.
Well...
Hey, mack!
Fantastic! That you could figure all that out, and lay that down on her, to come up with a way you could get your toast.
Only what's on the menu...  A Number Two: Plain omelette. It comes with cottage fries and rolls.
You want me to hold the chicken.
She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
I just can't look at you.
No.
Daddy's very ill.
Well, I really appreciate it, Carl.
Do you want some gingerbread?
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Where is she, anyway?
You were going without saying goodbye?
What have you been doing since then?
Nothing.
That's right. Have you anything to suggest?
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
That'll make you happy.
Did you hear about my misfortune, Robert?
I hope you feel at home, Robert.  I'm really glad you're here.
I've walked across a stage a number of times, without exciting any particular response...
Haven't you got a jacket or anything with you?
No, I wouldn't.
Hey, follow that truck. They know the best places to stop.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
The choice of words, "squashed flat," juxtaposed against the image of a fluffy kitten...
That's exactly what I am doing, again.
Alright, tell me, what'd you hear?
I told you, no. I'm not that type.
Who are you?
Yo.
Remember me, from the pool?
So what you think of me?
Why don't you ask Eddie?
Forget it! C'mon Let's go to the pool.
Oh man, what we gotta leave ar' own neighborhood for?
Amanda is Eddie's cousin.
The one with the phat ass?
I'm gonna punch you. What you want with her anyway? You in love with her?
Yeah, he got boxes in his stomach. He's taller than me.
Now salsa, you know how to dance salsa?
You sure? She's got kind of like brown hair.
So what do you want with her anyway?
How do I know you're not lying.
I know how ta get him back if you want.
I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah?
I wasn't asking.
You decorate this yourself or did Mrs. Chief of Police help you?
Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down.
You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it.
I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you?
Thanks for coming down to see us.
Greetings, everyone.
So where do you know Alan from?
Sure, but the end was so sudden.
For sure?
My pleasure.
Can I get you something?
I did not break nor enter. I simply chose an advisable location to await my client's delinquent husband.
You owe Wendy nine hundred and eighteen dollars.
You should have proved that in a court of law.
I think he was sleeping with Wendy, too.
Are you serious?
Damn... lost again. Sorry.
Why don't you check it out for yourself, Mr. Nugent?
He doesn't read my stuff well.  'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.'  That was stupid, Alan.
And what was that?
I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two?
Has he?
I'm calling the police. Then I'm leaving. You wait here for them.
Why are they after you?
Sure you did.
Where does the Chief get the drugs?
That's Brazil.
I'll give you a thousand dollars cash just to come to my house and listen to the proposition. If you reject the proposition, you keep the thousand, and your mouth shut.
Alan Stanwyk.
I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that.
I have the same problem with my help.
Do you have a passport?
Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
Will you kill me?
'...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
I overheard it. He thinks you're completely out of control, he said he was gonna can you as soon as he got the story. If I were you, I'd just chuck it, Fletch. Screw him. Let him eat three full pages on Sunday.
I just thought... sure.  Sally Ann Cavanaugh.
Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife?
I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great.
Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really.
That's a strange combination.
Okay. I'm delighted to have someone to talk to, and you're very cute, so I'm very flattered, but I'm also very married so you may as well forget -- You are trying to hit on me, aren't you?
Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you?
'I've been so many places in my life and times. I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes...'
'But we're alone now, and I'm singing this song for you.'
Here's this dog that tried to eat me. Here's my motel. Here's the car I rented...
What is this....
Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club?
No wonder.
I was supposed to meet Mrs. Cavanaugh.
I spoke to her last week. She didn't say anything.
'Uh, almost' is not an answer. 'Yes Frank, it's all done': that's an answer.
Oh, I hate it when he calls me that.
What's the spread on the game tonight?
I have some ideas.
He threw me in a cell, took a gun and a knife and threatened to kill me right there if I didn't promise to give up the story.
I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute?
Oh, that!  Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy!  Roseanne Barr naked!
Some fag.  Charged me up the ass.
That was close...
You gotta shave before you leave the house in a dress like that and I don't mean your legs.  Why didn't you jump on her?  What's happening to you?
You wish.
G'day, they say it's worth three grand...
You're saying you need money.
That's for me... Radio contests, really Ford, how tacky...
So what about this watch?
Quiet.  Tell me you tapped in the police computer and found out lots of good stuff about Art Mooney...
A fucking C.D.  Wow, this case is closed.  So, she's got bad taste in music and in men... Did I tell you she and Johnny were lovers and that they were into something and he got killed for it?
I wish I knew.  You did good work...
Hmmm, the first disc was putting out an incomprehensible stream of high bits.  This one is putting out low bits.  The data is in some fucked binary system.  The two discs need to interface simultaneously with a third decryptor disc.  Comprendo?
What an interface!
I just can't deal with all this crap between us, I'm sorry.  I'm quitting.
Got those Vomit invites here...
It's red, Ford.
You okay?
Uh... wha?  You're supposed to answer those questions, not ask 'em.  I take it a woman named Colleen Sutton is not your big sister and that the late D.J. Johnny Crunch ain't your daddy?
You hung out with Bobby Vomit. Who would want him dead?
Why are you depressed?  You get in all the clubs, you never pay cover...
Are you okay?
I know the feeling.  This must be hell.  Can you believe, a flucking sorority... I'm gonna vomit Day-Glo.
Ford, you were right!
I'm afraid so, you want her?
Oh how sweet, your friend's got his own star.
Hoh graphic!  I'm going to dream of ears for a year!  Ugh!
Fairlane, you gonna find out who killed the lead singer of Black Vomit?
This ain't no social call.  One hundred bucks.  To find my father.
Holy Colonel Mustard.  Gosh, you didn't mention the big clue... Kid, I can't take your money.
I tried to help you...!
Hey, I love you, too, you little jerk.  Jesus, guy tries to make a commitment and he's gotta eat shit.
I need someone to help me with my case load, you interested?  This whole father/son thing, if you're not into it, I mean, it's okay. You know what I'm saying?
Like me.
'It's booty time, it's booty time, across the U.S.A.  It's booty time...'
It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
Feel my thumb?  I keep it there forty seconds more and a welt develops cutting off the oxygen to your brain.  I leave.  Twenty- one minutes later, you're dead. The slowest, most painful minutes a person can experience.
What's fine?
Oh.  One more thing.  This is personal.  I want you to tell me you're a big sissy.
Good to meet you, Mr. Fairlane. Your mouth makes quite a reflection.  I'm Julian Grendel.
Well, hello, Ford.
What about Don?
When I say 'no,' run for the door.
Yeah, it's pretty amazing how much cash you gotta give to the actual artists who create the music.  Those ingrates really take a bite.  But seriously, when Pops died, you got Vomit, Crunch, and Sutton to help finance a C.D. Cleans operation. You got greedy and they tried to get the three discs together to threaten you, but...
Man, Julian, that accident took away more than your hearing.
You heard that Bobby Vomit O.D.'d, right?  Do you suspect foul play and stuff?
Hi, private eye guy!
Hey, troops, here's that rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.
This isn't music!
So...
Ever pick your feet in Poughkeepsie?
I got a name - Sal Boca, Brooklyn.
Got a wife named Angie.
Takin' care o' business -- it's after midnight.
Well try, okay?
Sal --
What's your name, asshole?
What?
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
Henri c'est gentil d'être venu.  Je vous présente mon associé, Pierre Nicoli.  Henri Devereaux.
Look, I'll level with you -- I need a little more time -- I got to shift gears.
Le sommes nous?
Sale boulot.
If this bridge were in Europe, it would be on every tourist's sight- seeing list.
Where's he from?
That's in France.
What about you, Doyle?  Who's the best fighter you ever seen?
Why not?
I got this little chick I'm tryin' to hit on.  She's about 20, 21... I take her to Jilly's last night and she's tellin' me about how she wants to settle down one day, get married... I says, "Hey, this is 1971, baby, I'm just a dirty old man lookin' to score with some pussy."
Yeah, we got the Westbury covered like a tent.
Never trust anybody.  You goin' sick?
The greaser with the blonde.
If that's not a drop or a pickup, I'll open a charge for you at Bloomingdale's.
I'm goin' check on this address in the Bronx, if you're bullshitting me, it's your ass.
What happened to you?
Throw 'em in the bathroom, will you? How good are the warrants?
You want the red or the white?
There are four auto graveyards like this one in the other boroughs, handling about a thousand vehicles a month.  Those that aren't claimed are auctioned here once a month.
It was a crematorium.
What am I, a shmuck?  What's the hurry?  He could see a couple of shows and visit the top of the Empire State Building.
So whatta you want a badge?  It's your first major league game Sal. One thing I learned, move calmly, move cautiously.  You'll never be sorry.
Which is why your phone lines are tapped and the Feds are crawlin' all over you like flies.
You okay, man?
You give him his drops?
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
Lucky throw, fire boy.
Satch, you gotta just give me...Satch is here John.  You hear me?  Satch is here.
I wanna be wrong here.  But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.
I swear, Satch.
As nuts as that sounds, yes.
In the bottom of the 7th, Weis is gonna hit a solo home run.  Jones and Swoboda are gonna score in the 8th.  The Mets are gonna win 5-3.  Go watch the game, Satch.
Frank.  We know.  We know it's Shepard.
Okay, start pedaling.
Don't think about falling, just keep pedaling.
Daddy, Daddy, I can't.
You ready?
Are you licensed to broadcast, buddy?
I'm right with you, man.  He's got the heart of a lion.  Hey, how 'bout the first game of the Series?
The World Series.  You called Buford's homer.
What'd you say your name was?
Now you listen to me.  My name is John Francis Sullivan, I live at 1060 41st, where I've lived my whole life.  And I saw the first game of the '69 Series at my Uncle Butch's house with my father...
What the hell...
What's going on?
That's impossible.
Dad...?
How could this be happening?
We gotta be bouncing off the mother sun spot of all time.
You sound...ground up...?
1998...?  This is wrong.  Who are you? Why are you doing this?
What are you talking about?
What?
But that's tomorrow.
Don't go.  Don't go in that warehouse...
We're doing all right, Dad.  We're doing good.
It's hard to explain.  Something happened today.  It was like a dream.  And when I woke up I had all these new memories. Good times.  Times we never had before.
Are you alright"?
Whatta you mean...
I gotta take her away, John.  I'm gonna take your mother away.  He can't hurt her if I take her away.
So what should I do?  Call the police? You think they'll believe me?
What do I tell them?
Whatta we do now?
What else, John.  It must be different, huh?  Are people living on the moon?
Listen to me, very carefully, take your wallet out, just touch it on the corners.
It's gonna work, Dad.  We're gonna stop him.
I'm here, Dad.  I'm here.
Wait.  Something's wrong.  I don't...
Hey, Sull.  My cable's out again.
You're not looking too good.
Maybe you outta lay off a little...
She makes ten.
Our lucky break.  Mario ID'd the dental. Mary Finelli...reported missing April 16, 1968.
Got a minute?
He ain't our guy, John.
Hi, this is Julia.  Please leave a message after the tone.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
So how'd you like LION KING?
I know.  I'm sorry.  Work.
Are you a good cop, John?
Hell-
My name is Abel.  And I am my brother's keeper.
You're all just jealous.
So what would a weekend in the country be without sex?
Why don't we go take a swim?
We'd be all alone.  We could do anything we wanted and nobody would see.
That was the best yet.  Was it you... me... or the hammock?
Hey Deb... can you hear me?
I'm gonna be sicker than all of you, man.  Now I gotta spend the whole weekend totally straight...  I don't think I can make it, man!
Here.  Go down the cellar and check the fusebox.
I appreciate the fact that you worry about me, but don't.
You know what I've been through. Don't ever scare me like that.
I don't know.
Look what I found.  Remember these?
Goldilocks and the Three Bears?
I don't know.  I don't see you for months on end, and when I do, you put this wall between us.  How do I break through?
What are we gonna do?
This is no time to celebrate!
We're really sorry, but it wasn't our fault.
That's it.  Pull over.  I'm drivin'.
Darren, we better turn around.
Yeah... We're gonna scare him.
It's kinda frightening to think that a kid like that can go so far over the edge.  Jason really screwed up the poor sonofabitch's mind.
Come on, you guys!  The game's over!!
Once we nail Roy, that's it. Victory is ours.
How do you know?  Did you take his temperature?
I thought Jason was only a legend?
Can't you at least call the camp and make sure everything's all right?
Rick.  Keep and eye on our wacko kid.  I'll be back as soon as I can.
Yeah, hi.  Listen, I've got to talk to your dad.  About Jason. I've got a plan.  I need to buy some things first but mainly need help to...
There...Ya happy?
Why?
Okay, give it back.
Where'd you get this?
Well, grown-ups think it's funny to be scared.
So where's Cort gone off to?
Now you better cool out a minute, boy.  You already almost got your head blown to pieces.
No problem, Rick.  Come over and meet a former resident here, Tommy Jarvis.  He's got some kinda prank going about...
Yes!
I was going to call the clinic and have them collect your ass.  But I don't want you around here any longer poisoning my daughter, or anyone else, with your warped mind.
-- But this time they bombed him and then cremated the body.
I understand.  However, our audience should be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho skin stretcher.
Mr. Duke tonight I'm prepared to offer you your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of --
Steven buggin' you?
That's very colorful, chief.
Tell me!
Wanna know how I did that?
How many times do you want to hear this?
I've told you the truth.
She asked me to come over.  She said she had something to tell me.
What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
That's disgusting.
I think it's time for some recreational activity, girl.
Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch?
Where's the radio?
Hello, Charles. Has everyone checked in?
You have no right...
What are you doing??
Did you find Rennie?
He's doing the best he can, Charles.
I...I can't...
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Stephen King supposedly used it when he was in high school.
So, are you having fun yet?
I seem to detect a hint of ingenuousness in your tone.  In other words, level with me.
Yes...
It's okay...you're going to be okay.
I don't know...we've gone off course or something...
I think so. But we have to lower the anchors so we don't drift any further...
We'll be okay. I want you to wait by the lifeboats, just in case.
I used to be head of neurosurgery. Big hospital in USSR. This hospital, I'm not kidding.
I wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. I ate and drove. I had one of those big checkered cabs.
Crosstown.
Under the Manhattan Bridge.
Guys ready to order?
A lovely piece of theater. Small but important.
But didn't we know it would happen?
It's just a review.
What happened eighteen months ago?
I used to carry a gun when I drove a cab.
How do you Eknow.
What do you mean?
Had to be him.
I think you're a little confused. Nothing personal friend.
This could be it.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
I never see you anymore. Where are you all day?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
She's doing like those Iranians. `I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
And you blame me. It's because we never talk. Let's talk.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
See, Daddy.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
And you've been extremely patient.
I went because you went. You smoked because I smoked.
Alma Wetzel.
This could be it!
Across Ninth Avenue. Dodgie's. Where you've been getting your hair cut for fifty years. Where Uncle Billy and Uncle Marty got their hair cut. Where Jim Rorty shot a man for cheating at poker.
We must have been heroic.
I do know the answer to that. Why don't we watch the ball game later? We'll go to Mannion's.
Of course they're gonna lose. We'll watch them lose. What good is heartbreak if we don't experience it firsthand?
Hey, Pop. I know you don't like the commotion of opening night. But I especially want you to see this play. It's new territory for me. And for you too. I have to know what you think.
Let's not start that again.
Where's your elastic brace?
You didn't think it was okay when you lived here. You wanted to get out so fast I thought you were running a marathon.
What do you want me to do?
Some little kid stole the hubcaps.
A grandmother. God bless you.
You're a family man, Frankie?
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
They're my team.
And you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?
aybe we ought to postpone the opening.
What do you mean?
And he has finer moments now and then.
I'm trying to prolong our afternoon. In case you haven't noticed.
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Just like proper English gentlemen. I'm proud of them.
Here, you see? Even the South African papers apologize -- "a monstrous attack."
"Take a sixth step, that we may follow our vows in life."
"...what shape it will take." Jinnah has -- what?
You really are going to Pakistan, then?  You are a stubborn man.
You're a clergyman.
If I want to be one with them, I have to live like them.
I'll take your luggage back, baas.
We only make wild speeches, or perform even wilder acts of terrorism. We've bred an army of anarchists but not one single group that can really fight the British anywhere.
Maybe I'm wrong... maybe we're not ready yet. In South Africa the numbers were small...
I don't believe it -- even the British can't be that stupid!
They are only clinging to old dreams  and trying to split us in the old way. But the will has gone -- Independence will drop like a ripe apple. The only question is when  and how.
And you've come all this way because you think something is going to happen?
We hope you intend to join us in the struggle for Home Rule, Mr. Gandhi.
Who is that young man?
I must say when I first saw you as a bumbling lawyer here in Bombay I never thought I'd be greeting you as a national hero.
We need your help!
They're sparing no one, I see.
I don't know who they've left out there to do the work. There can't be one mine left open. Have they touched the women?
If we hold firm, it won't be the last.
Perhaps some tea?
I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure  under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
Ah -- we should invite Gandhi. What the devil has happened to him anyway?
He was right. It's insane -- anything would have been better.
You almost sound like you believe that.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
Some believe it is associated with creativity, although there's no evidence.  Also for sports like baseball it can be an advantage.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found.  This was an angry killing.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
Of course.  He's a "de-gene-erate".  He works at Gattaca.  Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?  Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night.  What more do you want?
Surely you know what you have.
We believe we have a suspect.
Would you care to look--in the telescope?
Right now, <i>your</i> presence is creating more of a threat.  I don't think you have any concept of what we do here--how meticulous our preparations must be.  We are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal.  So it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders.  Besides, I don't believe there is any evidence that the killer <i>is</i> amongst us.  I don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.
Suit yourself.
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again.  We should cut our losses.
Again?
Everybody goes there.
I have your samples ready.
Anything I've forgotten?
I understand.  That's already been taken care of.  Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have at my disposal but for a little extra...I could also attempt to insert sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.
Vincent...Vincent...
No problem.  Before he dropped out he was an honor student, the right majors--
Yeah.
These new personality corrections I've been reading about.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
So you didn't do it after all.
What happened?
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
What is it?
I've got enough here.
--I've read your profile.  I don't know about the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own.  You can have other children.
You're back with your own people now. Got you some professionals.
What about them?
You hired Jackson and Rudy., not me.
Close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings I pulled.
You okay?
Feel good?
What's Beynon got set up?
Just like old times?
Where did you get them developed?
Half a million.
You been okay?
That's not all of it.
You go out much?
It's just been a while.
Keep going over these. I don't want anybody getting lost.
Promise you won't laugh.
You know I've actually gotten tired waiting sometimes... worn out waiting.
I mean it.
We are always going to be all right tomorrow. I'd like to be all right a few todays.
They checked in.
Tell me about Beynon's ranch.
Do you trust him?
Let's send his cut back -- Just keep going.
Yeah.
He must have.
You've got it all figured.
There may be a hunting party.
What?
You can't trust anything these days.
Okay?
I always thought jails make people hard. Not you. You're just not tough enough to forget about Beynon. I chose you, not him.
Things can't get much worse can they?
We've got some food coming, should be here any minute.
What now?
Where's home?
One thing though... how do I explain this to my wife?
Gonna knock down a wall?
Two.
I'll hang on to these. We don't need them till we get to Gollie«s. Okay. Any questions?
When she gets here, have that kid of yours help her with the suitcase.
Where we go in1?
I guess you ain't gonna shoot me, are you?
Let's just get to the border.
Don't you want to go to the airport?
You do what he says, Harold.
A couple of weeks back.
What do you want?
What's it got to do with you?
Well, he drove it into the river.
I made a mistake.
I'd like a word with you, Jack.
Everyhing go off all right?
She's nothing to do with me.
Hold it!   Hold it!  Who killed Frank, Margaret?
Really.
How were things between you and Frank?
Nothing more? Just another feller?
I call that regular.
Once a week you like a gentleman?
I don't believe you, Margaret. Frank wasn't like that.  I'm the villain in the family, remember?
Do you?
Yes. I met him last year.
How'd you know where I'd be?
Aren't you scared Kinnear will find out?
That's why you waited for me.
Then he must have pulled her.
Oh, what you doing now?
You all right now?
Good. I'm off tomorrow, so I don't suppose I'll see you again.  There. Go and get your hair done.
I couldn't believe it when I heard. Carter is suddenly attentive.
It just would. He was always the same.
See you later.
What happened to you, then?
I'm staying with a friend.
Will this do?
What'll they do to him?
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
What about Keith?
So you're doing all right then, Eric. You're making good.
You're finished, Jack. You know that, don't you? I've bloody finished you.
You couldn't win an egg and spoon race, Eric.
Yes, I can see your problem, Mr Kinnear.
Do you know, I never knew he worked in one of my places!
Not suede boots!
Are we here to play cards or talk about the old days?
Four hundred?
I'll see you, then.
You missed a fucking sale.  Big deal.  A deadbeat Polack.  Big deal. How you going to sell 'em in the first place...?  Your mistake, you shoun'a took the lead.
You had one you'd know it.  Patel. They keep coming up.  I don't know. They like to talk to salesmen.  They're lonely, something.  They like to feel superior, I don't know.  Never bought a fucking thing. You're sitting down "The Rio Rancho this, the blah blah blah," "The Mountain View--" "Oh yes.  My brother told me that..." They got a grapevine.  Fuckin' Indians, George. Not my cup of tea.  Speaking of which I want to tell you something:  I never got a cup of tea with them. You see them in the restaurants.  A supercilious race.  What is this look on their face all the time?  I don't know.  I don't know.  Their broads all look like they just got fucked with a dead cat, I don't know.  I don't know.  I don't like it. Christ...
We're stuck with this...
...this shit...
It is.
You're on this...
And it's not right to the customers.
That's right?
...that's right...
For some sales pro...
Who?
That's thinking.  Now, he's got the leads, he goes in business for himself.  He's...that's what I... that's thinking! "Who?  Who's got a steady job, a couple bucks nobody's touched, who?"
The nurses?
River Oaks, Brook Farms.  All of that shit.  Somebody told me, you know what he's clearing himself? Fourteen, fifteen grand a week.
Yes.  It is.  It is simple, and you know what the hard part is?
How many leads have we got?
And you're saying a fella could take and sell these leads to Jerry Graff.
We're just "talking" about it.
No.
You didn't?
Is that what I said?
A job with Graff.
Oh, yes, George.
Are you sure?
...you don't have to come in...
Why?
You need money?  Is that the...
What is the five grand?  What is the, you said that we were going to split five...
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm fucked on the board.  You.  You see how...I...  I can't...my mind must be in other places. 'Cause I can't do any...
Yes.
Clear...
Yes.  I'm no fucking good.
I am?
He said he filed...
The cops?
Why don't you think so?
Yes.
Thieves.
Read it.  Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.  What happened here?
Who used to say that?
Who told you...?
Roma!  I'm talking to you...
The people downtown said...
You stupid fucking cunt.  You, Williamson...I'm talking to you, shithead...You just cost me six thousand dollars.  Six thousand dollars.  And one Cadillac.  That's right.  What are you going to do about it?  What are you goin to do about it, asshole. You fucking shit.  Where did you learn your trade.  You stupid fucking cunt.  You idiot.  Whoever told you you could work with men?
I'm going to have your job, shithead. I'm going downtown and talk to Mitch and Murrray, and I'm going to Lemkin.  I don't care whose nephew you are, who you know, whose dick you're sucking on.  You're going out, I swear to you, you're going...
Would you come in here, please?
No.  John.  No.  Let's wait, let's back up here, I did...will you please?  Wait a second.  Please.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  I didn't "blow" them.  No.  One kicked out, one I closed...
John.  John...
I'm not sure I have two.
Can't do it.
Why?
What happened?
How could I tell 'em your sale?  Eh? I don't have a tel...I'll tell 'em your sale when they bring in the leads.  Alright?  Shelly.  Alright? We had a little... You closed a deal.  You made a good sale.  Fine.
The only thing remarkable is who you made it to.
Would you?  Would you...?  Or you're gonna what, fire me?
Yes.  I hear you.
Why I don't...
You robbed the office.
Okay: I...look: I'm going to make it worth your while.  I am.  I turned this thing around.  I closed the old stuff, I can do it again. I'm the one's going to close 'em. I am!  I am! 'Cause I turned this thing a...I can do that, I can do anyth...last night.  I'm going to tell you, I was ready to Do the Dutch.  Moss gets me, "Do this, we'll get well..." Why not.  Big fuckin' deal.  I'm halfway hoping to get caught.  To put me out of my...  But it taught me something.  What it taught me, that you've got to get out there.  Big deal.  So I wasn't cut out to be a thief.  I was cut out to be a salesman.  And now I'm back, and I got my balls back...and, you know, John, you have the advantage on me now: Whatever it takes to make it right, we'll make it right.  We're going to make it right.
What?
Don't.
Why?
Rick.  Let me tell you.  Wait, we're in the...
Shelly...!
They took the leads?
Fuck you care...?
How was it...?
You closed 'em today?
And, and, and, I did it.  And I put a kid through school. She...and...Cold calling, fella. Door to door.  But you don't know. You don't know.  You never heard of a streak.  You never heard of "marshaling your sales force..." What are you, you're a secretary, John.  Fuck you.  That's my message for you.  Fuck you and kiss my ass. You don't like it, I'll go talk to Jerry Graff.  Period.  Fuck you. Put me on the board.  And I want three worthwhile leads today and I don't want any bullshit about them and I want 'em close together 'cause I'm going to hit them all today.  That's all I have to say to you.
No...Black Creek.  Yes.  In Florida?
Mr. Morton's with American Express... he's...  I can tell Jim what you do...?
Oh!  My God...I've got to get you on the plane!
What?
I've wanted to talk to you for some time.  For a long time, actually. I said, "The Machine, there's a man I would work with.  There's a man..." You know?  I never said a thing.  I should have, don't know why I didn't.  And that shit you were slinging on my guy today was so good...it...it was, and, excuse me, 'cause it isn't even my place to say it.  It was admirable...it was the old stuff.  Hey, I've been on a hot streak, so what?  There's things that I could learn from you. You eat today?
Yeah.
...all train compartments smell vaguely of shit.  It gets so you don't mind it.  That's the worst thing that I can confess.  You know how long it took me to get there? A long time.  When you die you're going to regret the things you don't do.  You think you're queer...? I'm going to tell you something: we're all queer.  You think that you're a thief?  So what?  You get befuddled by a middle-class morality...?  Get shut of it.  Shut it out.  You cheated on your wife...?  You did it, live with it.  You fuck little girls, so be it. There's an absolute morality?  May be.  And then what?  If you think there is, then be that thing.  Bad people go to hell?  I don't think so.  If you think that, act that way.  A hell exists on earth?  Yes. I won't live in it.  That's me. You ever take a dump made you feel you'd just slept for twelve hours...?
Monday.
Who did she call?
When did you write the check?
I'm very sorry, Jimmy.  I apologize to you.
I told you.
No.  She told me "right now."
No, no.  That's just something she "said." We don't have to do that.
No, Jim.
What...?
What?
Fuckin' asshole.
You hear what I said?
Eight units.  Mountain View.
You just this morning...
We haven't got a lead...
They didn't get your contract.  I filed it before I left.
They got, listen to me...
What's the fucking point in any case...?  What's the point.  I got to argue with you, I got to knock heads with the cops, I'm busting my balls, sell you dirt to fucking deadbeats money in the mattress, I come back you can't even manage to keep the contracts safe, I have to go back and close them again...What the fuck am I wasting my time, fuck this shit.  I'm going out and reclose last week's...
Why do you have to go?
Sit down.  Your Aunt Connie and I waited for you to have some lunch, but now it's all dried out.
But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization.
What took so long?
Bought at the airport.
It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true.
We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen.
You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore.
Then why do you come to me?
Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive.
Goddamn bitch.
What's 'cent' Anne?'
Now what is this talk about joining the army?  Eh?
He is weak.
The child cannot harm you.
You tell your friends I expect them to let me wet my beak in the same manner.  Don't be afraid to tell them.  Clemenza and I know each other well, he understands these things.  Let yourself be guided by him.  He has more experience in these matters.
Ten to one shot, you said.  Ten to one shot in my favor, and I lose.
My life won't be worth a nickel after tomorrow.
Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie &quot;Five-Angels&quot;...thought you were never coming West.
Hiya, Freddie Corleone.
Oh, 'scuse me.
Count on me; that's my specialty.
How is your wife, Fredo...your marriage?
Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance.
That's off now.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie.
You're going to talk to him now.
Will you tell him?
Goddamn it, where were you?
She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place.
Me too, Tom?
There's a lot I can't tell you, Tom. I know that's upset you in the past; and you've felt that it was because of some lack of trust or confidence.  But it is because I do trust you that I've kept so much secret from you.  It's precisely that at this moment, you are the only one that I can completely trust.  In time, you'll understand everything.
I don't think so.  Unless I'm very wrong...they're already dead. Killed by someone inside...very frightened that they botched it. That's why I am going to disappear in a few minutes, and leave everything to you.
I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him.
What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore!
How did they get their hands on Pentangeli?
They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million.
He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years.
I want it met.
I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.
It might show.
I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him.
I think I prefer to see my client privately.
You're right.
Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then.
Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels.
...and the tape will be running.
What the hell are you talking about?
Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand?
Is he related to the witness?
Senator Kane.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
I won't let you leave!  Christ, do you think I'm going to let you leave.
You missed my point; you are no longer an owner.
No, I meant lose his family.
I still don't speak Spanish, Michael.
Enjoy.
You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station.
Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all?
It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not.
You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola.
Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power?
Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York.
Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him.
I know.
Senator Geary, I speak to you as a businessman who has made a large investment in your state.  I have made that state my home; plan to raise my children here.  The license fee from the Gambling Commission costs one thousand dollars; why would I ever consider paying more?
On the phone?
He don't want to talk?
Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine.
Don't I look like I'm listening?
What if I say shove it?
You want a war?
Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog.
Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was.
Thanks, doll.
What makes you say that?
Yeah, well keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.
This looks corny.
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
You know what?  I think you guys are all jealous.
He's an artist.  Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
The look on your face!  You're not marriage material.  You're not even boyfriend material.  You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
So you don't want to fuck.  That's what you're telling me?
It's your job, lady, not mine.  I'm here so he can draw my picture.
What're you talking about?
Got a lawn this afternoon, but I'm free until then.
The Master is dressing.  I am to offer you a drink.  There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
I bet you've seen a lot of famous people come and go?  Movie stars?
You mean family?  All in Joplin, Missouri.
Then you're as single as I am.
Sins of the flesh?  Everybody has those.
I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
Thanks.  Why do you do it?
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy?  Please, Clayton.  It will be better if I find the body alone.
I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean?
Excuse me, but -- are you famous?
Sure, everybody does.  When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week.  Why?  Were you an actor or something?
"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
Sat for an artist.  Been sketched.
Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
All right then.  Sure.  I could use the extra dough.
"Bride of Frankenstein."
It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar.
You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
No.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
I never thought you were.
Ah.  A philosopher.
You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done "Show Boat." Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  "The Road Back."  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece.
I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work.
I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back?
Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?
No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea?
It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow.
Good afternoon, Clayton.
No.  The girl.
Is that --?
By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over.  He missed out.
Them's the breaks, right?  No war stories for this pup.
That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
It's from the first World War, isn't it?
Just take off the fucking mask!
Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised?
You okay?
I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume.
I didn't ask George to invite you.
That's as good a way as any to describe it.  I've seen far worse cases.  You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
Take the Luminal to sleep, or whenever you feel an attack coming on.
Is that Boris?  Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches?
Which ones?  I bring them all.
She is horrible.
Mr. Boone.  He is an interesting friend.
It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora...
That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours.  "Bride of Frankenstein."
Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?
So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know?
Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses.
I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay.
George Cukor?  Who made "A Star Is Born"?  I never guessed.
Just like going swimming, isn't it?
What are you doing here?
It's been a long time, Memphis --
Six years. Shit. Time flies, don't it? Six years ago we were fartin' through Armani and pissin' Cristal. Now look at us ...
Speak for yourself, boss I don't have a Hollandaise sauce
I think about that night a lot...
I can come up with the front money. Pay you back...
Get out of here, Ray --
They just brought in Donny Astricky. Shot by a jacker ...
You have my word...
I hope it's not your dear sweet mother...
Or your baby brother. What was his name?
I know you.
You're thinking: okay, there's no want ... But they probably stripped its guts and crated 'em up, right ... ?
What's this -- ?
You seem a little hinked-up ...
Got it ...
You mean the poor --
Lookit Kip. All grown up...
Forget that ...
Eleanor is Memphis' "unicorn."
We're on a truncated time-table. Take a day to shop it; a day to prep it ... And we're still going to need to expand the crew...
The corner of Hawthorne and Granvia. Tumbler messed up. He said the Lotus would be at the corner of Hawthorne and Granvia --
You look good...
What are you doing back?
Why didn't you tell me?
I remember. Supper getting cold, cos you two are out there heads under hoods ...
Breakfast brunch -- ?
Any more, O -- ?
I dunno. It was right here. Someone musta' boosted it back...
Jesus, Kip ... I'm shot, man ...
I heard you were pumping gas -
Nah. It's a scratch.
There's certainly a time and a place for a mellow olive -
What happened to you?
You?
You?
We do this. Then. You're finished. Then. You're clean
Having fun, Kip?
Too early to tell. Nervous?
What are you doing here?
Where'd you find this one?
You boost her -- ?
What are we gonna do -- ?
Call 911 -
See you're still stealing the sailors from the sea --
Buy you a drink?
On account of Mitch?
I do ... I cut "em...
I ratchet your ignition mechanism ...
Let me worry about The Club ...
This time it's for real?
Some crew you got ...
You need him...
This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
I logged outside the G.R.A.B. site, right? Then I monitored their incoming outside data requests, right? Then I got these ISDN numbers, right? Then I tracked them back, right? Then I took the one I could jack-up the easiest, right? Then I called back see, they think I'm an insurance company - that's where it looks like I'm coming from -- and they're sharing stats with this insurance company, right? So now they're sharing it with me, right? They think I'm looking for stats for an actuarial conference on auto-theft. So they let me in, right? Give me all these numbers. But then I don't leave, right? I'm in. I've got the key. Now I just go anywhere I want.
There's excessive resistance in the cranking circuit ... You know what you gotta do -- ?
But he was always a bad kid, that one.
Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.
No. The other one. The one who disappeared up the block from Christie. The one they made a beef on.
I don't want any more of that Shit.
I had a meeting with Tuddy around eleven o'clock and here I am a back-up guy.
It's all bullshit. I swear. It's nothing. Whatever you want, we'll do.
Don't worry about Paulie. Is he helping you? Is he putting food on the table? We've got to help ourselves. We just have to be careful while we do it.
Okay. Don't worry about it. It's okay.
What are we going to do with him? We can't dump him in the street.
Give'm a drink.
What fucking good are these things? They don't fit. What do I need this for? I'm not paying for this shit.
I You wasted eight fucking aprons on that guy. :
I gotta go home.
Batts's made. His whole crew is going to be looking for him. This is fucking bad.
You gotta help me. Okay? This girl I told you about? Diana? She's from the Five Towns. She's Jewish. She won't go out with me alone. Can you believe this shit? She's fucking prejudiced, but she's built. She's never been out with an Italian before. She says she'll only go out on a double date with her girlfriend.  You believe this shit? But you gotta see her. I mean, she's beautiful.
I hate to do dishes.
I don't need this... You said tonight and now it's not tonight...
How is he? Okay? Are they busting his chops?
Don't worry about the schools. We'll take care of the schools.
You think that matters?  You think they give a shit about anything? The little bastards.
You?  You think you're the only one?  I've talked to them a million times, but they don't listen.
Two weeks? That's nothin'. My Uncle Marty? Will knows him. That guy fuckin' drinks like you've never seen! One night he was drivin' back to his house on I-93-- Statie pulls him over.
Who's she talking to?
--Yah, restructurin' the amount of retards they had workin' for them.
Casey's bouncin' at a bar up Harvard. We should go there sometime.
She didn't do it again did she?
I didn't get on Cathy last night.
How's the woman?
What?
Are they hookin' you up with a job?
Why didn't you yoke him?
Okay.
Hi.
--That isn't funny--
WILL!
Yah, that is a nice ass.
Holy shit.
What'd you say about me?
Hey, asshole. Happy Birthday.
Will, our offer starts you at eighty- four thousand a year, plus benefits.
What class did you say that was?
How'd you like that course?
To tell you the truth, I wasn't there much. The class was rather elementary.
Could you just check, because the young man who works in my building--
Please, I'm a professor here and it's very important.
What's your name?  Don't you walk away from me. This is people's work, you can't graffiti here.
Hello. Gerald Lambeau, M.I.T.
--That edge!
I told you to cooperate with these people.
Get out, Will.
--This can't be right.  This is going to be very embarrassing. Have you ever considered--
--You know how fuckin' easy this is to me? This is a joke!  And I'm sorry you can't do this. I really am. 'Cause if you could I wouldn't be forced to watch you fumble around and fuck it up.
Yes.
Have you heard of Jonas Salk?
Hello.
I didn't see you at the reunion.
I'm sorry, that damn conference--
Why me?
He's from Southie? How many people did you try before you came to me?
Jobs doing what?
--And confuse him--
--And here I am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake--
--Is that what this is about, Sean? The Field's Medal? Do you want me to go home and get it for you? Then will you let the boy--
He won't be a failure!
You're wrong, Sean. I'm where I am today because I was pushed. And because I learned to push myself!
So I hear you're taking some time.
Do you know when you'll be back?
About thirty million to one.
So, you finally got a job Morgan?
You're right. I know.
Who is "Danny Terrio?"
Yeah, I read those.
That must have taken you a long time.
"A History of the United States, Volume I." If you want to read a real history book, read Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States." That book will knock you on your ass.
Guy your age shouldn't smoke so much. Stunt your growth.
Yeah. Do you paint?
Crayons?
Oh, "Starry Night" time, huh?
Jesus Christ, you are an amateur.
Really? How'd the date go? WILL Do you still counsel veterans?  I read your book last night.
Is that why you didn't write anything else?
Well, I've read you colleagues. Your book was good, Sean.  All those guys were in your platoon?
You don't regret meetin' your wife?
Would have been nice to catch that game though.
Do you think you're alone?
Do you have a soul-mate?
They're all dead.
Don't give me you line of shit.
It's not about that job. I'm not saying you should work for the government. But, you could do anything you want. And there are people who work their whole lives layin' brick so their kids have a chance at the kind of opportunity you have. What do you want to do?
The wrench, why?
Oh, I know.
Don't fuck with me.
That's what you want?
I just want you to know, Sean...
No. Thank you.
You suck.
Sounds good, where are you now?
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School.  I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Now, I'm gonna make all these caramels disappear.
No I haven't...
Yeah.
How many?
I couldn't wait till tomorrow.
I'm trying to explain it to you. So you play the piano. When you look at the keys, you see music, you see Mozart.
Come with me to California.
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me!
You doin' the hirin'?
All right, mister. I'll go. You just show your license to contrack, an' then you make out a order--where an' when an' how much you gonna pay--an' you sign it an' we'll go.
Will ya look at her!
Leave him alone, Ma--Al's just billy- goatin' around--
Ain't you gonna look back, Ma?--give the ol' place a last look?
That don't sound like you, Ma. You never was like that before.
Lots must a died, too.
Maybe the road's out.
Think I'll look aroun' an' see if I can't meet me a girl.
I didn't see nothin'.
Well, I do declare!  I baptized you, son.
Course I'll say grace if somebody sets out the food--  --but my heart ain't in it.  Nice drinkin' liquor.
Excuse me for asking.
And you ain't ashamed?
Maybe Ma'll have pork for supper. I ain't had pork but four times in four years--every Christmas.
Your granma was a great one, too. The third time she got religion she go it so powerful she knocked down a full-growed deacon with her fist.
They're all gone--or dead.
Think she'll hold?
He seen you, Tom! You wanta be fingerprinted? You wanta get sent back for breakin' parole?
Well, if it ain't Tom Joad. How ya, boy?
I don't expeck we can las' much longer-- some a the folks ain't et for two days. You goin' back tonight?
But we can still do it, honey.
They shore don't waste no time!  Take her out.
For three dollars a day, that's what I'm doin' it for. I got two little kids. I got a wife and my wife's mother. Them people got to eat. Fust and on'y thing I got to think about is my own folks. What happens to other folks is their lookout.
How about a lift, mister?
Been doin' a job?
I don't stick my nose in nobody's business.
Sure, plenty, but not in no wreck like this.
An' the nex' thing you know you'll be out, because they got it all figgered down to a T--until the harvest is in you're a *migrant* worker--afterwards, just a bum.
Yes, ma'am.
No, ma'am. They ain't no work hereabouts. Pa's in tryin' to sell some stuff to get gas so's we can get along.
Easy, *easy!* You wanta bust his head wide open? Pull his arms, John.
How long you plan to be in Arizona?
Ma... all this, will it hurt the baby?
You don't know *no* girls around here. You're lyin', *You're runnin' away*!
Jus' sassy, that's all.
Connie's gone.  Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that...  An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here.  It put the chillun to sleep.
Forget it, Ma. I got her figgered out. Long as I keep outa trouble, ain't nobody gonna say a thing. All I gotta do is keep my nose clean.
I'm a-tryin', Ma. Honest I am.
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
What is it?
I know you would, Ma. But I ain't gonna let you. You hide somebody that's kilt a man an'... an' you'd be in trouble too.
I been thinkin' about us, too--about our people livin' like pigs, an' good rich lan' layin' fallow, or maybe one fella with a million acres, while a hundred thousan' farmers is starvin'. An' I been wonderin' if all our folks got together an' yelled--
Well, maybe it's like Casy says, a fella ain't got a soul of his own, but on'y a piece of a big soul--the one big soul that belongs to ever'body-- an' then...
Which ones?
Tommy?
Listen!  That's some of what done it--the dusters. Started it, anyway. Blowin' like this, year after year--blowin' the land away, blowin' the crops away, blowin' us away now.
Some say I am.  You want to hear what happened?
What was the use. He was right. There wasn't a thing in the world I could do about it.
Listen!  That's them! Them lights! Come on, we got to hide out!
You mean get off my own land?
How you get all this money?
Whatta you think you're talkin' about? I got a han'bill here says good wages, an' I seen it in the papers they need pickers!
Morning.
Lotta these little farmers mighty nice fellas. Trouble is they're little, they ain't got much say-so.
But wait. I still don't understand what you do.
What do you do?
Welcome back! I'm Arlene Oslott- Joseph.
So, what are you doing now?
So. You and Debi. Gonna hit that shit again?
That's a tragedy. Can I finish my story please? I began my search for meaning. I was a Catholic, Jew, Scientologist, Sufi, Buddhist. I went to a Psychologist, psychiatrist, herbalist, nutritionist, a shaman, and a psychic. And they all pretty much say the same stuff.
Basically the same thing. In a very evolved, esoteric way.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
What's your business?
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
You're fucking psycho.
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
He was trying to kill you, right!
Not the other way around...?
I was leaving.
You went to school with these people.
Like a union?
Is that right?
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
I'm an attorney. I'm with Moss, Brice & Fromeyer.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
This is not good.
I bought a new rug.
What's a revival tent?
So what happened to you?
God it's great to see you.
I have to get my head back into my work.
This is Annie MacLean.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
What?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Shit.
Thanks.
Yeah.
How long did you live here with your wife?
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Show me again.
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Yeah?
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Oh. You didn't tell me.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Did he mention it?
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
Well...  So you tried riding again?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
Who's going to want me now?
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
How's everything?
It's me.
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
Okay. We'll see you later then.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment...  I wanted to say something...  But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
Aw... that's so sweet.
How was the dinner?
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
What did he say?
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
And you think it's best if I don't come.
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
How are you feeling about work?
Was the trip okay?
I have so much to tell you.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
Sounds like something Tom would say.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
- See, what you can do for him --...
He says if you do it soon as they're born, it makes them real easy to handle later on.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
Isn't it like, obvious?
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
Sure?
Grace, I need you to come with me.
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
It's warmer than I thought.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
Jude, you okay?
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
You want to watch some television?
What, sweetheart?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
IT WAS MY TURN!
Long enough.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
You think it's cool?
How's it going, Ray?
Good. Good man. Alright, let's finish up here, and take him in for interrogation.
And never again have to pay for a service that would be dirt cheap...
Shit!
What?
Uh... Nikon, can I... can I crash at your place tonight?
Oh man. That's universally stupid, man!
Biggest crash in history, front page, New York Times, August 10th, 1988. I thought you was black, man! Yo, man, this is Zero Cool! Oh, shit!
Damn!
Nonononono. Truce, you guys. Listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? A wake up call for the Nintendo Generation. We demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child, but when I became a man I put away childish things.  What... It's Corinthians I, Chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. Come on.
Yeah?
And what's he do?
Due to Mr. Gill's untimely demise and everything, I guess you two will have to improvise the next round.
Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.
Seven. Wow! Burn's wetware matches her software!
What the hell are you doing?
It has a killer refresh rate.
Make it our first date.
This is every financial transaction Ellingson conducts, yeah? From million dollar deals to the ten bucks some guy pays for gas.
And no one's caught it because the money isn't really gone. It's just data being shifted around.
What?
Shit!!
I can't believe they decided you won.
Uhhh.. ahahaha...
Did you find the program for the virus on any of the discs we confiscated?
You're welcome.
There's a new virus in the database.
What? whatwhatwhat?
Any questions?
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
A hacker planted the virus.
I don't want to go to jail for this.
I'll take you down there.
So?
Just leave me alone and lets forget it.
Brady!
Brady!
It's hard to tell, there all chewed up.
Oh dear God. Its all right...a bad dream, just a nasty old dream.
Found it.
Why not?
Because the lights are all out.
Yes.
Night Doc.
Okay everybody, listen up. I've got Rachel Corruthers and her sister in the truck, and I'm taking them outta town route 410. State police are on the way. Got that?
It's been eleven months.
The Discount Mart. Can we get Ice Cream after?
Had enough?
Jamie!
Rachel!
We'll hear sirens soon.
Why don't you go make some coffee.
Hi Rachel.
He's not married. Besides, I've got a right to do what's best for me.
Well do I drop you off at the Discount Mart or the Dairy Queen?
132 to 133 this is 134.
That's impossible. Michael Myers is an invalid.
Six bodies, Sheriff! That's what I have seen between here and Ridgemont. A filling station in flames. I'm telling you Michael Myers is here in this town. He's here to kill that little girl and anybody that gets in his way.
When he makes that call.
Is that him? Is that him?
It was Michael Myers. He's come home to kill.
You son of a bitch, you just created a lynch mob.
How's it powered?
Loomis. Haddonfield.
Rachel, Jamie. Thank God!
What?
Someone broke into the hardware store. Probably kids.
You're going to be late at the Doyles, Annie.
Hello?
Sure, see you later.
Probably Mister Riddle.
You'll have to. He's calling you tomorrow to find out what time to pick you up.
Lindsey, Lester's barking again and getting on my nerves again.
You idiot!
Sheriff? I'm Doctor Sam Loomis.
Come on... A skunk could have killed it...
A man wouldn't do that...
I keep thinking I should call the radio and TV stations...
Sure...
They could be.
Where were you? I went back to the Myers house...
Is Annie around?
Can we make Jack-O-Lanterns?
Will you read to me? Can we make popcorn?
..."how now, cried Arthur. 'Then no one may pass this way without a fight?' 'That is so,' answered the night in a bold and haughty manner..."
Not any more.
I saw the bogyman. I saw him outside.
Who is it?
Be quiet! Get Lindsey and get into the bedroom and lock the door!
DO WHAT I SAY! NOW!
Everybody has a good time tonight. Okay, kids, what do you want to do now?
Hello.
He was your patient, Doctor. If the precautions weren't sufficient, you should have notified...
There's nothing else I can do.
Sam, Haddonfield is a hundred and fifty miles from here. How could he get there? He can't drive.
...then he gets another physical by the state, and he makes his appearance before the judge. That should take four hours if we're lucky, then we're on our way.
Thorazin.
Just try to understand what we're dealing with here. Don't underestimate it.
I see.
Pull up to the entrance!
...any sister talk?
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Yeah.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
We're a big hit.
Oh!
Oh, geez, yeah.
Uh...
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
What?
I gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
I can't resist.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers.  Something's wrong.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Oh, what, what do you do?
Yeah.
The design's deliberately noncontextural.  But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
We could...we could do that.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family.  I mean, he's, you know, he's--
You've had some dizzy spells.  What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
It's not that big a deal.  We just didn't hit it off.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Hi.
Well, yes, I'm killing time.  I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
e.e. cummings.  I'd like to get you this.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
How's everything?
Elliot!
I was looking for you.
I know!  I-I-I-I, I realize.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
And you're in love overnight?
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
Are you?
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
Don't make it worse, Dad.
I want ice!  Who's got some--  Oh, there it is.
Oh, Mom!
I don't understand.  I thought that you would be happy.
Well, because I never thought of God in my life.  Now I'm giving it serious thought.
I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious.
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
...or films you must see or... 
I don't sell my work by the yard!
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
Oh, Jesus!
N-n-no, not that.
Well, he has to rule out certain things. 
But you don't have any symptoms!
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
You're just realizing this now?
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
How is everything?
Come on!  Hurry up!  Let's go!
Gee.
I'm so humiliated.  I don't know what to say.  I mean--
How could I ruin myself?  What do you mean, ruin myself?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
Hey!
Okay, okay.
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
What?  You're kidding!
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
You found all this, all this out on one date?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
Oh, gosh.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
You treat me like a loser.
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
Can we, can we go?
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
I'd never do that.
People change...you know.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
Nobody ever said it.
This is it.  Yeah.  This is really-- HOLLY  Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it?  Something...that I wrote?
No, the reason I ask is--
No, I haven't.
Oh, I'm fine.
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
Oh!
Oh, wow!
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
When'd you get here?
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
What makes you interested in becoming a Hare Krishna?
I can't think.
A reward...
Well.  Word gets around.
It's a poor workman who blames his tools.
What have they got you doing?
I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School.
Yes?
Why me?
You said "here's what <u>they</u> want you to do..."  Why?
That would adversely impact my income.
We could skip the Gavotte.
There's one or two freaks, and, for a "<u>Pass</u>," I'll rat them out to you... 
...aren't you afraid of me...?
...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust?
You're ready now.
...they're sending me.  Out to get Shot.  Hounding me.... they're... 
First things first.
Where was the call from.
...and then, he'll be coming down.
Yes, I did.
I could have acted on my own.  I was told...
Look at this:
No. 
I am all attention.
I think that's... {HE STARTS TO RISE, AND THE MEETING BEGINS TO BREAK UP) Starling, I'm sure these gentlemen...
S'hotter inside than it is <u>outside</u>...even with the air conditioning. 
Waal...
Give it up, Evelda.
Give it up.
Sadly, no.  And I find that birth is one of the few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend. What do you think?
Of course, Commendatore...
Yes.  Packed and with an inventory. 
Darling, Dr. Fell.  My wife Madame Pazzi.
Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by the Studiolo.
Who does not?
I require...
She's not the first foster that you've had.  <u>Is</u> she?
Yes.... yes...
You find something objectionable to working in partnership with....
You were given backup....
No, I don't get you...
Oh, is this your political position, you're opposed to Joint...
And, fine, alright, and fine... what are <u>you</u>doing, this whole time?
I'm going to cut you loose.  With all due respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I'll shoot you dead, do you understand...?  Do right and you'll live through this.
...I'm sorry....?
...which of us is free...?
Look what they put her on...
Yeah, well, it's a raw wound, innit, you're gonna bump it, every time you turn around... but you know what the <u>trick</u> is...?
Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room.
Yeah.  Well.  They're a talkative buncha commentators.
Fine, thank you, but
I am on the track of...
Ask me when we get home.
Hello....?
I know where he is.
I know something no one knows.  He has had his finger removed.  On his left hand.  It left a scar. 
An Honor.  Carlo Pazzi....
But perhaps, there is some, some less radical solution.
Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as I'm sure, that's a "clue"...
Tell me why...?
Yes.  I think I <u>do</u>.  I think it is a phrase you used with that woman.  You told her you were an <u>orphan</u>.  You <u>used</u>, to your mind, your most private fears.
...<u>barter</u> with her.  To appeal to her, and you feel that...
Yes.
And you have decided to accept... to accept this "emotion," as you put it, to the ... the "sweepings. of the Lechter case.
You want some <u>advice</u>.
Ah, yes, ah yes.  Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to <u>capture</u> him?  How terrible for you...
Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.
Sadist!  I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline?  You're a monster.  That kid is going to be traumatized for...
That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
You think you're so...but you're just...
I'm gay. Like you didn't know.
Summer would have been a lot less without you. You're a true friend, Donald.
No.
Pamela Anderson, Kate Moss, Halle Berry, and Fiona Apple, all naked in one room. You can do anything you want to them, except one of them has full-blown Aids, and you don't know who. And you're not allowed to use a condom.
Howdy Pouty.
That really sucked, Eric, what you did, asking him that...
You know, I think I left something by the lake. Could you check it out-- You'll know it when you see it...
I guess it was too much to ask that it would somebody older...and maler. Like you.
I don't know what I'm doing. I know he only likes me as a friend. He's just so...everything--I know he only likes me as a--but it came up that he used to be a camp counselor and I used to be a camp counselor...
You look a like you could use a friend.  You know, I'll never forget my first day at camp. Boy, I was so nervous that I...
We had fun. I even got along with Talia-- for about three minutes. I don't know why she hates me so much...
Yeah. I guess I do.
"Iunno." I'm really beginning to hate that word of yours. I'm sorry for sounding hostile, but I'm not sorry for...

God, you're beautiful.

How's my little cheerleader? Now I know everyone at your high school isn't so uptight, come <u>on</u>.
I don't know. This thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Hey, this question wouldn't be that bizarro thing you were babbling about over the phone last......
If you're going to openly be a bitch....
Doesn't it bother you that everyone in the school thinks you're a pirahna?
Pretend you're a missionary saving a colony of cootie victims.
That episode with the note back there was for all of us to enjoy, but you're determined to ruin my day.
You stupid cunt!
You were nothing before you met me! You were playing Barbies with Betty Finn! You were a Brownie, you were a Bluebird, you were a Girl Scout Cookie! I got you into a Remington Party! What's my thanks? It's on the hallway carpet. I get paid in puke!
Anyway, I can say never to high school. I've got David.
So tonight's the night. Are you two excited?
Where did you get these?
What do you want from me?
TEENAGE SUICIDE; DON'T DO IT!
Hi everyone, door was open. Veronica, you missed it! Pauline and Whitney James were up there doing there suicide rap when the cops come in and announce that Martha Dumptruck tried to buy the farm. She gave the ticket girl at the Colfax theatre a suicide note then bellyflopped in front of a car.
Heather, why can't you just be a friend? Why are you such a MegaBitch?
God, aren't they fed yet? Do they even have Thanksgiving in Africa?
God Veronica, drool much? His name's Jason Dean. He's in my American History.
Watch it, Heather. You could actually be digesting food.
That was seriously warped, Veronica.
Veronica. What are you doing tonight?
It's like they're just people I work with and our job is being popular and shit.
Dreadful etiquette. I apologize.
O-kay. We'll cook up some soup and put it in a Coke. Sick, eh? Now should it be Chicken-Noodle or Bean-with-Bacon?
What are we going to tell the cops? "Fuck it if she can't take a joke, Sarge."
Heather Chandler is more popular than ever now.
Jason, why don't you ask your little friend to stay for dinner.
Do you take German?
This is Ohio. If you don't have a brewsky in your hand after dark you might as well be wearing a dress.
We killed them, didn't we?
Your son's dead and you love him.
You shoulda stuck around, jerk. Ms. Fleming wants to redefine the high school experience.
You're getting too cool for me, J.D. I don't know how to talk to you.
Look at that. Eskimo. One word. I love it. I usually go for whole sentences myself, but hey this is perfecto. Eskimo. So mysterious...
Tomorrow someone else will move into her place. That person could be me.  Ha, there's only one of us who knows Heather's handwriting and if you think I'm doing another suicide note.
You know what I want, babe?
You really fucked me up, Veronica.
Answer him dick!
Sex and Drugs and HBO is all I ever need! Whoa! Can you hear me! Hello Tokyo! I said Sex and Drugs and...
You two....
Turn that back on!
Heather Chandler, Kurt Kelly, and Rupert "Ram" Sweeney all had good looks and popularity, but there's one thing they didn't have: Values, Ambition, and Hope.
I'm so sorry. I was led to believe there were going to be different kinds of social and psychological types at this gathering.
Let's have 'em now, while they're fresh, eh, Nora?
Come on! Sausage rolls.
accompanies Hilda into the hallway.
He's the manager!
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
My name is Gina!
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
Mummy!
She's terribly hurt . . .
To be known as He!
Him.
I shall call him Diello.
I think I'm going crazy.
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
But that's not true! I've got one.
What's happening to me? What are you doing?
You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.
Please. Heart attack. That was easy street.
Skin cancer.
No.
Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?
I have my connections
Bret you are making no sense whatsoever.
Who's Allison?
No. No you said HER BODY's been missing.
You could say that.
Oh my God. It's coming out.
How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year.
The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet.
You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day?
Kirsty... Kirsty?
It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control.
Morgue...?
Look Larry I know you never thought too much of me. And I know this all sounds a little fucked up.
Hello? City? Cops? It's a fucking conspiracy!
Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left.
You mean... when the car went off the bridge?
Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
Wait... what the hell is this...
Tawny? What's- what are you doing?
You okay?
I'm kinda feeling nuts myself!
Sell it to him.  You get a couple bucks, it pays for the ride.  I got a job, nice apartment.  I do okay.
Hey, Bubber, c'mere!  I gotta talk to you, buddy.
The bathroom!  For two days?
And she thinks you're blackmailing me?
Great!  You make this big goddamn mess, then ya jump.  Beautiful! Listen, John, I was there at the hospital today, I seen you with those little bastards .
Looking... good, partner.  Hang in there.
Involved!  Christ!  She attached my goddamn paycheck!  Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?  You know what I mean.  Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
Listen, now that I owe you twenty-five hundred bucks plus, how about loaning me twenty for cab fare?
I seen on the TV where that do-gooder asshole's gonna go visit sick kids at three-thirty.  Children's Hospital, on the double.
You gotta kid?  How old's your kid?
We're all assholes, Bernie?
Bernie, how'sa kid?
Bill, I...
Bill, I got financial problems and...
He waited for you three hours!
Three weeks, Ev.  I didn't tell him I killed anybody...
How do ya think I got it, for Chrissake?  Hey, put that thing down.  This is my goddamn apartment, you can't just...
What, is everybody in love with this, bozo?  I don't get this.  What about...?
Hey, lady, I got faults, I know I'm not perfect but I don't get this at all, your attitude.  I saved your...
Underbelly!
I snuck in.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
You never saw that picture, huh?
Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
Uh, er... I...
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
Years?  There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
You were... very... inspiring.
It's not right, Gale...
"A little mistake"!
Hey, listen, great that you're a career-fiend, I got a wife and family, I...
What's the matter?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman.  Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
I thought they'd all go "It's him! It's him!" and hug the guy or something.
He's not <u>supposed</u> to be an actor, that's the whole point.  He's a <u>real</u> <u>life</u> <u>hero</u>, all he has to do is <u>act</u> like a real life hero.  That's the <u>beauty</u> of the <u>concept</u>, the whole <u>freshness</u> of it.  Did she call him back?
No dead body.  Too bad.  Not too often you guys get pictures of a body even before the cops get there. Exclusive!
You didn't... get it on with him?
Reporters don't have hormones?
Look at that.  You can't buy better protection than that.  That there is your Man's Best Friend.
So, <u>Neil</u>.  How's it goin'?
Give it here, Bernard.
Where are these toys of yours?
All right then.  That's important, isn't it?  -- For you to be in an "up" environment.  I'm saying you should literally take that as your <u>base</u>, do you know what I mean? It's something positive that you've accomplished -- even if you were forced by circumstance -- something for you to build upon.
I'm happy that you're working again.  As long as it comes naturally, that's terrific. You've always liked working with your hands, haven't you?
Yeah, things are moving along, but she's still involved with this other guy and it's a little tricky.
That's terrific.  Don't be afraid to be demonstrative.  You're sounding a lot more confident than when we last spoke.
As long as you keep remembering why.
And please, don't for God's sake misinterpret that as being the voice of discouragement in any way --
I've cultivated her interests so that now we have even more in common than ever.
Well, can I make an appointment?
Do you do washing machines, too?
So, you're just kind of a roving --
Do you have a family?
You must value your independence.
I was thinking about our conversation the other day -- what you said about choices.
I found a cent!
Well, that's what happens with grownups, too.
Daddy's gone where Rudolf went and isn't coming back!
"Hi. I'm Mr. Edgar!"  Look, Mommy, it doesn't even hurt him.
You've done a really great job with the house.  It's great!
Have you just plain asked him?
C'mon, kids, let's go.
Why can't you just drive me to my old school every morning?
Thank God.
Whew.
Honey --
This -- is -- the -- one -- for -- us.
I know it's at the high end of our range --
We're going to think about it.
How long does it have to be a new house?
I get to the restaurant and he's not there. I waited for forty- five minutes.  When I called his office, his secretary said they thought I had cancelled.  I had cancelled!  Then I get back to my office and <u>Aranson</u> is waiting for me and he knows <u>everything</u>.
Honey -- I can't find those large- size Hefty trash bags!
Oh God.
Just reduced.
It's fun.
Are we gonna buy this house?
We'll get cable when the cable company is good and ready -- you think you can survive till then?
Neil, do you mind?
Y'know what?  I'm ready to cancel our trip.  I really am. I've had it.
A <u>man</u> started the fire.
Do you see a man?
Really?
My name is Jennifer Hillman.  I'm an archaeologist.  I read in the paper about the murder yesterday and I thought I should come talk to you.
What do you think?
Tough.
He had to come from somewhere.
I asked the State Department to check with our Embassies and Interpol to see if there were any similar occurrences like the bank.  Two weeks ago in London Charles Redder from the Bronx was mugged in Hyde Park.
I brought you here to talk about him. Do you know him?
Do you not hear the wind in the trees?  The songs of the birds.  The horses breath?  There is a whole world around you. Alive.  Living.  Feel it -- become part of it.  Live your life, Highlander.  It's going to be a long one.
England.  There is nothing for me here anymore.
You've been seeing her for over a month now.  Have you learned nothing from the past?
Then take me with you.
Electro magnetic soundings indicate we've only got a few inches of rock left before we reach the main chamber.
I don't think so -- but then, maybe you've can guess how a guy with a sword could rob the First national Bank this afternoon -- and get shot six times in the chest by the guard and still get up and walk out?
Bullet proof vests don't bleed.
Why do I feel that you know what's going on?
You are a very persistent woman, Miss Hillman.
I'm just trying to place you.
You're not an easy person to get to know.
How come you wanted to meet tonight?
That makes you uncomfortable?
Just a little.  Who knows what we're going to find in there.  It could be a huge excavation.  A little friendly PR never hurt.
Incredible.  The cloth -- the buttons -- it looks to be mid sixteen hundreds.  It's a remarkable duplication.
You stayed here again last night?
I'm having some people over tonight for dinner -- I'd like you come.
Highlander -- I had hoped it would be you.
Aye -- I know, Las -- and I have never loved anyone more.
I heard voices downstairs.  Is everything alright?
Talley.
Dead end--it's a clone.  What about the Mustang?
Who sent you?
Mars, watch the cops!  Kevin!  Watch the back of the house!
C'mon, Dennis, this is stupid.  I thought we were gonna go to the movies.
Someone should stay with Mr. Smith.  What if he wakes up?
The only way he can keep the cash is if nobody knows about it.  He's gotta cap all three of us before they even read our rights.  He's probably planning it right now.
Then we might as well die rich.
You with the cops?
Fuck you.  I'm running this shit.  You talk to me.
All three subjects are confirmed inside. Call off the house-to-house.  Okay, Dennis, I want to explain your situation --
You've been in there a long time. What're you waiting for?
My father needs a doctor.  <u>Please</u>.
You got something to say?
L.A. County Sheriffs are inbound from a bank robbery in Pico Rivera.
<u>I don't know</u>.  Talley talked those punks into letting Smith out.  He's fucking us over, Glen.  That guy is fucking us over.
What do you want?
They're close.  Let me make a call.  You can see they're okay.
Can we talk some more when you get here?
The Sheriffs will take over when they get here.
Why don't you guys grab some dinner at the Thai place?  I'll meet you there as soon as I can.
We can't carry him.
What do you want?
Kevin left without you.
Smith!  Wake up!
What are you talking about, shot?  What happened?
Where are they?
What's wrong with the radio?
He says that his father's hurt.
I'm not stupid!  You can't get out of here fast enough, then you take back command; you agree to wait on Smith, then you risk everything in a stupid stunt to get him out --
We're out two minutes, me and Dreyer.
Okay, here's mine.  My name is Special Agent Jones.
What's my name?
The kids are in here!
Can you open them?
That would be Glen Howell.  He was on his way for the disks.
Can we let go?  You past your shock and all that, we can turn you loose and you won't do something stupid?
Marlon and Al....
I have people in York Estates right under your nose.  If you do <u>anything</u> except what I'm telling you, you'll get Jane and Amanda back in the mail.  We clear on that?
I guess we each have something the other wants.
What happened?
Ten.
You will run into the hotel and hide behind the U.N.
We've heard reports of reprisal killings. Will the UN intervene to stop the bloodshed.?
Have you requested re-enforcements?
Excuse me, Colonel.
I don't understand.
No, Paul, they're afraid. They've demanded to be moved back to headquarters now.
Paul, this scotch is exceptional.
The American assured the colonel that they would watch everything.
Satellites.
If I were to spare a few policemen, where would I station them?
Please, General, I will give you money, whiskey.
You have cockroaches dancing on tables and you tell me the cellar is empty? Did they drink my whiskey?
You know what the Scottish call it?
Ishca Baha - the water of life. I went on a tour once of the finest single malt distillery in the world. Have you ever been to Scotland?
We are better here.
I led no massacres.
A bargain buy, from China. Ten cents each, I'll get a dollar.
Everything is double the price now, you do understand that?
Let's go.
Satellite feed.
Holy shit! Holy shit.
Let’s go, Jock.
Get out of this room and get back to work.
Gregoire it is good to see you back to work.
Give her what she wants, room, food, anything. Charge it all. Don't you put her out, Paul.
It's an order. Get everyone out now.
Are you trying to make a fool of me? There are no Europeans left in that hotel. Get me the names of all the cockroaches in there.
Who did you call?
What do you want?
The commander is not here.
How much?
Show us the manager. He wears a suit.
No, it is impossible. That side of town has been destroyed in the fighting. The children are dead.
Everyone is dead there. The dogs eat the bodies in the street. I have to go.
This time the Militia will kill us.
Good evening, Odette, who is sick this time?
They do not have your connections.
Send them home. We are not the police. What do we have to protect them?
Them. They almost got us all killed. I have done enough for them! We cannot look after them anymore.
Any luck?
Has Roger spoken yet?
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
I will not leave without the twins.
Please, please try one more time.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
Rutaganda's place?
Where's housekeeping? They won't pick up.
You are my family now, Zozo, my brother. I will get you out of here.
I don't know.
Take a bow, Steven, you've outdone yourself tonight -- scared holy hell out of even me.
Oh, he's got no problem with that: I'm his fourth.
Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
-- bullshit --
How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
And how the hell are we going to do that?
More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
Oh, for chrissake --
More the merrier.
Melissa!
Oh, really: who?
Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
'Less the place really is haunted.
What's in there?
New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."
How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
Pritchett, is that you?
Pritchett!
I'll meet you down there.
Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it.
Is she...alright?
Why not?
You hear somebody?
I was upstairs with Eddie --
Good point.
Price!!
It's okay, everything's okay now.
The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
What?
...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
Then what the hell are we doing here?
What are you talking about? You think I invited them?
I mean, did she stage it all for you and then go hide -- or did you just flat out kill the little bitch --
-- what...are...you...going...to --
-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
I'm ready now.
I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime --
I think...I may have the answer.
-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
Vannacutt!!
What is it??
If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
I'll take my chances.
Then tell me, please -- help me...!
Please! I need your help.
It works.
Wish I could take the credit, but --
And you think it's in there?
Pritchett: what is going on?
It doesn't say.  But that's not what interests me.  There's no death certificate for the daughter.  Anywhere.
Town records are coming up now.
It will heal.
What do these ingredients mean?
Well then who did?!
Aubrey, come on down and have some dinner!
H-how long will it take?
What's he doing daddy?
I could use a little help. We have to return the van soon.
Now remember we have to call someone about that replacing that water heater.
It's just going to take a while.
To our family.
I wish I knew more about her.
What the hell is that?
Who?
Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
It just disappeared.  Literally.
You don't think I know?
Are you all right?
You're bleeding.
What do you mean, unfortunately?
I'm hungry enough to eat a horse.
You must be a Londrigan.
Go ahead.  I believe right now she may hear you.
What was she afraid of?
Well, you know where to reach me. The church is a stone's throw away if you want to come to mass.
Where did you find this?
Do you mind if I borrow it?
What, you think I'm kidding?  I guarantee it.  An inch more flank.  Boys upstairs get hot.  Bingo, you're an anchor-woman.
Better hurry, Doc.  A real story.  With a real reporter.
Wait ... wait.  You ... you have to help me.  I don't understand.  Am I dreaming this?
Well done.  Brave girl.  You've probably never shaken hands with a ghost before, am I right?
Something bad.
Wha .... ?
Look, lady!  I told you!  It's not my problem!  I was just there!
I put some decaf on.  Er ... make yourself comfortable.
How have you ... ?
Wow.  Lotta books.  You read all these?
But I don't know what's going on.
I was downtown looking for a ... a friend.  A guy I know.  Anyway, there was this store.  Like real old?  Lotsa weird shit in there.  I saw this statue. Pillar.  Thing.  I knew he'd love it. You've seen the club.
Everything sold as is.  No guarantees. No returns.
That had nothing to do with the world. Not this one, anyway.
JP?
Well ... of course I have.  I've thought.  I've ... Oh, JP, you were so horrible.  You really hurt me ...
Yeah ... yeah, it looks different.
Really?
Three minutes, 51 seconds.
Not anymore.  Now I'm the laziest damn cat burg--I'm going to take it so straight that I won't tape a Mets game without the expressed written consent of the National Baseball League.
Alex, did you know this ape was going to be here...
Whoa, you better cut a bigger hole than that.
You bastard.  You fucked my freedom for a lousy job.
Alex, are you....
My life is not some deal.  I...
My plan is just beginning.  I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?
Lucky for us, the Da Vinci is located in a wing of the Kremlin that they used to throw the Miss Ukraine pageant and stuff.  It'll have the least number of guards....
Let me be the one to quote Scripture.  ....As an agent of our organization, you are put in awkward situations.  Just remember, Hudson Hawk is an evil, evil man.
Oh, the shit is going to hit the fa--
For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces.  Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
Hey, don't take your disguise so seriously.
Way to go, Anna.
Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.
Haven't you ever seen, like David Niven?  You know tiptoe in, tiptoe out.
Alchemy!  Is the business term of the 90's, my man!  Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago.  I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history.  Money isn't everything, gold is.  Fuck blue chip stocks!  Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds!  I got the real deal!  Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
I look at you Soviet people and I feel... pity... superiority.  Most of your life, your government has told you that Capitalism turns people into robots who'd rather eat microwave sushi, naked in the back of a Cadillac than hear the laughter of children.
For those kind of wages, I could have built the factory in America! They're Vietnamese, can't we just give them more Bart Simpson shirts? I hear depressing news like this and I want to commit genocide!  Alfred, hold my calls.  So, Hawk! The Hawkster!  What do you think of the vehicle?
I'll torture you so slowly you'll think it's a career!  I'll kill your family, your friends, and the bitch you took to the Prom!
You wouldn't be out if it wasn't for me!  I did dog and pony for you!  You think they would have let you out after what you did, you told the board members they looked like the Three Stooges...
Remember that guy in the cell next to you who hung himself?
Guess I know who wears the penis in this family.
Get away from there, convict!
You killed a friend.  Why should I help you go for the gold?
Except yours-yours.  The goal of world domination.  Well, if you put it that way, Minnie.  How can I resist?
If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you.  I mean, who we trying to kid?  But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
Don't be stupid...they...
I Want to make things up to you. That's why I got you this gig, doll.  Hawk, my name's George Kaplan and to quote the late, great Karen Carpenter, "We've only just begun."
No, somebody powerful.  Oh.  Look. what's that up there?
Can't you see the Mayflowers double-crossed you...
Something short.
My God, why?! Why did he do it?! Things were going so well!
That smart?!
Why you don't even know y'own self -- you ain't exactly the genuine article are you, Miss Archuh?
I don't mean that! Why you pretendin' to be such a hard ol' sourpuss! Ain't never gonna make you happy! Never made Warin' happy.
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
A sawbuck!
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Hungry, anyway.
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
Well, she probably had a deadline...
Smitty.
...Certain people are --
...Huh?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
What a beautiful thought.
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
Oh, Norville --
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Muncie.
You can't print that!
Terrific.
It's a juice and coffee bar, man, like I been tellin' ya --
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Awwww, buddy --
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
...You don't?
...Jesus Christopher -- That smarts... Where was I? Oh yeah, the board. I guess Sidney's been puttin' the screws to ya, huh, Norman?
Geez, I --
Yessir.
...Yeah, go ahead.
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
...education, were you?
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Finally.
...adenoids.
Maybe he's wise.
Good morning, miss.
But I'm Miss Jessica's nurse, Alma. You don't have to do that for me.
Times gone, Fort Holland was a fort...now, no longer.  The Holland's are a most old family, miss.  They brought the colored people to the island-- the colored folks and Ti-Misery.
If you say, miss.  And the enormous boat brought the long-ago Fathers and the long-ago Mothers of us all - chained down to the deep side floor.
I'd love to.
Why, Betsy -- we can't lose you. You mean too much to us here.
Does she suffer?
She can never be cured?
I prepared these for you last night, Miss Connell.
Miss Connell's testimony will be very important.
They didn't teach it at Memorial Hospital.  I had my suspicions, though, about the Directress of Training.
The West Indies?
But it's so far away...
And that --  is my chair.  And this --  is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
What in the world are you talking about?  Six ounces -- ?
How do you know there's two ounces in a drink?
Betsy, can I talk to you a minute?
It is not beautiful.
Have the servants made you comfortable?
A figure of St. Sebastian.
That's hard to believe, after what happened last night.
And what is so alarming about the tower, Miss Connell?
You didn't find your patient so frightening in the daylight, did you?
Wesley can be very entertaining.
You have helped me.  I want you to know I'm sorry I brought you here. When I thought of a nurse, I thought of someone hard and impersonal.
I told you.
Two things had happened, Mrs. Rand. One was that your daughter-in-law had been taken ill with a fever. The other thing -- completely disconnected -- was that you had wished her ill, because she had hurt your sons.
I don't know -- I don't know--
But I assure you, Father Walters, Miss Connell had no idea of the consequences when she went there.
What about her?
Brilliant. Hey, you heading out a little early today?
Benjie!
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
What do you think?
Oh yeah. Musk, or something. You like it?
I... I think I am...
If you're going to insult me --
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
Elena.
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
I'm fine dad.
Grades?
Huh?
Dad stop it!
What you been up to?
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
Look, kiddo, don't worry about it. I really don't care that much. I'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.
We don't have to always go to your club, dad.
-- Well what am I supposed to call you?
I was actually trying to see about getting a little advice, you know --
Well, Elena and I have kind of been talking, not really talking, but --
But dad, you guys truly hated each other, I mean really hated each --
Oh. Elena wanted to know when we could expect you on Thanksgiving. It's just going to be you this year.
Hello you two. Am I barging in on some kind of religious study group? Elena, you look marvelous. Will I see you and Ben at the Halford's?
Well, I have to say I don't have much faith that my car keys are still in that bowl. Doesn't seem entirely safe, leaving your car keys around?
Thanks, but -- oh, I don't think so. It's been kind of a discouraging evening.
Jesus, let me make it up to you -- I can do better than that, honestly --
Hi mom.
Mikey Williams?
Oh.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years.  When was the last time you rode a bike?
-- And God the angry parent, and the Spirit the hope of an integrated adult self.
Self-realization. Ministering to help people reach their fullest potential. Would you believe me if I told you I want you to see yourself reach your fullest potential and self-realization?
I'm afraid she's something of a gossip, isn't she?
Reverend Edwards.
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
Sleep all day. I mean, look, it's already getting dark outside, and you're just getting up.
Shit. You're not planning --
Tonight? Jim, he's been out of it since he was born.
Would it matter?  And what's that?
Yeah but you don't even know me really.
No one.
Where you going?
Did you tell Sandy?
Wow!
You get in trouble?
Her name's Libbets.
Hood residence.
And?
All my model planes.
Want a drink?
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
I love you.
Nice kid.
And then I lost him.  In the fog.
Will, you can't blame yourself.
I'm going back to the Lodge, Ellie. Still need to go through some of Kay Connell's school records.
Duggar called him?
No.  But I covered it up.  I lied.
What about your shoulder?
He would have liked that.
That's why I'm here.  I need to know exactly what you saw yesterday, Farrell.
We're sure it's hers?
Forget your pager?
That's right.
That's right.
He's asking everybody questions.
I'm thinking I could get off with probation.  Keep half my pension.  That's all I want.
"She was nice."  Wow.  That makes me all soft inside.  Ever occur to you she didn't love you back?
You heard me that time.
I don't know what you're fucking talking about.
Just stuff.  I don't fucking remember.
Since grade school.
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here.  Leave us all behind.  That <i>he</i> was going to take her!
My arm!
She used some stupid code name.
You gave her gifts.
Don't you pull that shit with me.
Monstrous.
You don't want to answer... Two vampires from the new world, come to guide us into the new era as all we love slowly rots and fades away.
What are we?
So soon? Without any of those answers you so longed for?
I'm not your daughter.
Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
You made us what we are, didn't you?
Stop pestering me then!
Absinthe? You gave then absinthe?
I want more.
Why does he call you that?
You... fed on me?
It can't be -
She's no vampire.
I've seen enough of this! I loathe it!
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
You want death? Is it death you want?
Who the hell are you? What are you doing in my house?
What do you want from me?
Diane!!!!
You have to ask me for this. You have to want it, do you hear me?
Don't worry. He was white trash, they come at two a penny. I dumped him in the swamp and untied the slave, licked his wounds clean.
I wish I were. But if I were, what would I want with you?
You're body's dying. Pay no attention. It will take twenty minutes at most.
Dear God, what have I done?
You must get into it. It's the only safe place for you when the light comes.
I know. It gets cold so fast.
What have you done to me? You've condemned me to hell.
They know about us. They see us dine on empty plates and drink from empty glasses.
You fool, what have you done?
Where are we?
Why do you do this Lestat?
Do what it is in your nature to do. And you will feel as you felt with that child in your arms.
She's here, your wounded one.
Claudia, Claudia, listen to me. You're ill, my precious and I'm going to give you what you need to get well.
I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
You were going to kill me? Drink my blood?
What can I do to put you at ease? Shall we begin like David Copperfield? I am born, I grow up. Or shall we begin when I was born to darkness, as I call it. That's really where we should start, don't you think?
The story about stakes through the heart?
You loved Yvette...
You loved your wife, surely.
And did you lose her? Did she go?
Lestat escaped the fire!
You haven't the vaguest conception under God of what you ask!
Yes.
Wait...Did you say off-season?
I think I just really hurt Ray's feelings.
Say yes.
No means yes.
That could break the machine.
I'm not crazy...I'm not crazy. He's here...  We've got to get to the radio and call for help.
What do you mean?
Ray, I can't...
We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and...  You know...
Never do that again.
I am not crazy, Tyrell. He was right there.
Don't kill me --
Julie! Wait! You okay?
You sure?
Estes came after me with a gaffing hook.
Why are you doing this to me?
Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true.  I wanted you all to have a good trip.
Oooh, the mainland --
Tha's it.  I've decided.  I'm changing my major to finance.  And going to Wall Street.
I used to be a lifeguard...I'd hate to have to blow my whistle.
Ahh, that feels great.
Mark in the Morning! Magic 96.7! Oh my God! I'm Karla. Karla Wilson.  Jules, it's Mark in the Morning.
He leave you?
I'm sorry, but you could've been the one doing all of this --
You stumbled into my hiding place.
We didn't get all dressed up for nothing.
The last day of the season. Yeah, we heard.
There's ten people on this whole island and they're all gonna end up in this Jacuzzi with us.
They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners.  Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something.
Take this.
The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos --
But the gods played a little trick on me. I was born in Switzerland.
I'll go up and take a look at the General —- perhaps sit with him.
I'm here. The General is here. You are not alone.
There was some trouble here ——the villagers on the mainland —-this island was the focal point of their anger. They came here ——broke open the tombs and despoiled the graves.
I'm afraid so. There were rumors ——people were aroused. Some feared restlessness among the dead you know, the old superstitions.
Another sad task. We'll bury her tomorrow.  I think we'd better lock the door for tonight. It will make them less uncomfortable.
Where's Thea?
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
If Mr. Albrecht is right, we'll all be free in a few days.  I suppose you'll be going on to Athens?
Has she spoken to you of her father and her mother?
I have been troubled about you. I want you to know that my room is just downstairs --  You have only to cry out if you are ill —— or frightened.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
I've always known what an evil mind lay behind that pretty weak face of yours —— but this, Cathy -- even I would never have believed it is of you.
Woman, what are you doing here?
I have not had a happy life --but that one thing - - that terror which brings me awake out of deep sleep —- I want to avoid it.
I don't want to be buried alive. If I die I want to be sure —- quite sure.
That's superstition. That's something out of old tales -- about the dead who live —- I'm talking of something else --cataleptic attacks -- apparent death that is not real.
What is her illness?
This girl --
Better no general than one carrying the plague.
That's ridiculous -- Thea's lovely, gentle —-
I knew that feuds still went on, but I didn't think people like you and the General would be involved.
Hey, this is the company's posters, and the company won't like this.
George . . .
Good morning, sir.
Go through with what?
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
What'd you say?
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here?  Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Clarence . . .
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Hey, who's that?
A boy?
I know. I know. He didn't go.
You sent for me, sir?
Splendid! Is he sick?
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
Hey, Violet!  Hey, listen –– that's Violet Bick!
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Look, Daddy . . . paste it.
What boat you sailing on?
She's swell.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmm . . .
Mother, you know, I can see right through you –– right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
Yes, you bet.
Hope you have a good trip, George. Uncle Billy and I are going to miss you.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
Good afternoon, Mr. Bailey.
Hey, George . . .
Say hello to New York for me.
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
Holy mackerel!
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in –– providing he has brains enough to climb aboard.
Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a deal or isn't it?
Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
Not that it makes any difference to me, but why did you come to me? Why don't you go to Sam Wainwright and ask him for the money?
Yes . . . how much is your equity in it?
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
Oh, no.
If I told you it might not come true.
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
After that, who cares?
Have fun.
Where's your coat and hat?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
Where're you going?
Oh, George, George, George.
Pop, can I have the car? I'm going to take over a lot of plates and things.
Well, then . . it's usually customary to bring the money with you.
You can?
Come on, you guys.
For me...?
Wheee!  Faster!
Low tide at Cable Junction is 7:46 p.m.
It's okay, it's okay....
Don't!
Easy, easy -- you'll swamp us!
No.
But we had it!  We were headed right for it!
Coming up!  Give way!
Coming up!
You coming up on him?
We're hung up here.  Snagged.
Well, what the hell -- might be something worth seeing.  Take it somewhere and see if there's film in it....
Nine-thirty, ten maybe.
How long ago?
Mike's out there.
See where Cable Junction is?  Look to the left.  The lighthouse.  That's it.
What else is there to do?
Pop....
Is Hooper coming to dinner?
Jesus, don't freeze on me.  What about the others?
I don't know what you did, but that kid stopped.  I haven't heard one peep, not one 'breaker breaker' for days.  Believe me, it's a pleasure....
Wait a minute....
Length, 22 feet, 8 inches.
The what?
Could be a shark.  But maybe not.
Remember 1959, the Jersey shore?
Eat Cheerios.
Oh, hi -- How was dinner?
No.
The goddamn smell is always the same. 
Hi.  I closed a sale today, without Len.  That's $1200 commission, if the papers go through.
That you were fired.
I'll give notice.
No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing.  Be realistic.
Bullshit.
Martin, it could be anything.
Get him the hell over to Amity Point, the old lighthouse.  Right now.
There's a bunch of Kids day-sailing that way.  Turn them back to port.
If they're not at the light, look for them.  I don't want them out there.  Get them back to port!
Mom, Michael won't talk to me.
Hi Dad.
It killed her.  It ate her.
We're going to die.
How old is your cousin?
Get a dance yet?
Tina Wilcox.
Doesn't hurt to ask.  Sometimes the most beautiful girls are the loneliest.
Give me back my hat!
Mmmmmm.
Rich or poor, it's nice to have money.
That's fun!  Let's race for some- thing!
I don't care.
You're going sailing.
Wave to my son.
It would make a marvelous attraction;  the only Great White in captivity.
He's going with you, Doctor.
I'll need more men to look.
What's your plan, Brody?
Sure am.
Well, not much longer to go.
Look, Kathryn.  They're jealous.
My imagination isn't that good.
Damn it!
Let's head to the gate and work our way back.
You know, on our honeymoon, we should go scuba diving.
You sound like Houston Mission Control.  What the hell does it mean?
Don't think about it.  It's over.
You're going down there again?
After what happened to us?
Oh, yeah.  Really nice.  Who's your designer?  Sassoon Shark?
Finally.
They're not going to hurt you. They're encased in plastic.
It's too soon to move him.
Honey, what is it?
Come on.
What did you just say before? About water flowing through them?
Come on!
How is he?
... I have to go, honey.  Phillip and I are going down together to kill the shark.
That's right.
It's no use.  They won't come into the lagoon.
That's a load of codswopple.  A Great White doesn't fear man.  It doesn't fear beast.  It's an orgy of food and blood.
I want that shark alive.
Let's hope he knows that.
You were quite daring in capturing him.  Very skillful indeed.
Some miss all their shots.
Philip.
He's big as a bloody bus!
We can assume he's back in the water intake passage.
A piece of pie on Sunday.
He's a young one.
Kelly, could you look after Sean for a while?  Show him around for me?
This is where to be.  High and dry.
I know!  We can take the gondola ride!
Yes, it's great!
Isn't this fun!
No...  It can't be.
Gotta sneeze.
On monitor three.  Was a glimpse of something.
Hutton, how the hell did you get my crane?
You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
Thanks.  Bullshot.
No, South Georgia.
Polar bears.
I'll go with you.
He's big, Hutton.  You never saw anything so big.  Watch yourself.
That's impossible.
Hey, I'm proud of you, kid.
Okay, you two, have a good life without me.  I gotta go.
Mike, this is fantastic.  I mean, you're responsible for building all this.  What a job you've done! Maybe I'll quit school and come down here and work with you. Brody Brothers Construction. We've always wanted to do that together.  Boat building.
Yeah, he'll really go for that.
Yeah, right.  That's what you said about Janet, and Beth, and Barbara --
You'll spoil her.
How come it's my responsibility?
I could use a half-dozen more arms ...I've only got two weeks to get this thing finished....
Usually it's all he talks about...You mustn't worry....
At least he doesn't have a beard....
Give it some time, Ellen...See what happens.
Maybe he's got good taste...I don't think he's spent much time with a woman like you....
I see what you're doing....
Yes!
Your father was six then.  Just like you....
We have to dig it deep so the water will go all the way around...So we can swim to it....
I put everything in my room.  My Teddy bear is joining us.
I will.  I'll miss you, Grandma.
Mom, you're upset.  Sit down...Please....
Hey, come on, you can't believe that voodoo.  Sharks don't commit murder. They don't pick out a person....
There's never been a great white where we live.  It's warm water... They don't like it....
Oh, I didn't mean....  I'm being such a Grandma....
I want you to give up your work....
That's it?  Good...I thought you'd break out the champagne....
You look tired....
You and Sean used to make....
I'm worried.. We haven't had our....
You looked just like your father... The first time the shark came to Amity....
It got him....
I...I can't explain it.  It's just something I feel.
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy. The nightmares....
I don't know how....
It's just like driving a car....
You're impossible....
How do you like flying?
Our little island seems to agree with you....
I'll nick the boss' plane again....
Because it wouldn't occur to you to know why.  Blushing suits you....
I don't know why I fish here...Never catch anything...Must be a sign under the water...'Beware, Hoagie's here....'
Hurry!
Can you keep a secret?  Something no one else knows?
It was theirs anyway.  I 11 buy us all a drink....
When we find her we'll radio her position...The Coast Guard will pick her up.  Don't worry....
I want you to leave her alone.  I don't want you involving her in....
What do you deliver on all those charters you...?
Yeah....
She has good days and bad...I don't know....
Would you talk to her?  She's got it in her head that the shark came for him.  She still blames it for my father's death....
You moved any slower, you'd grow roots...We've got a schedule...shake it, man....
If you made them right, it wouldn't happen...They leak....
You couldn't find your ass with both hands....
I missed you, is all.  It's dull around here working alone...Smelling all that sweet cologne....
They won't fight with me....
Bad boy....
Office of Naval Research has some money....
You guys are making this into some- thing that just isn't so... It's just a shark.  A great big bloody wonderful shark.  Don't say anything to anyone. The locals find out they'll panic. They'll want to kill it.  We've got us a great white, Michael. We're going to do us some real research....
What for?  We've got a job to finish ...Why are you making the monitor?
When I invited you...
I thought we were planning a long rosy future together.
You sure you've done this before?
How long have you known Hoagie?
How long?
I don't remember.  One day he was just here....
Shove it....
Stop that!
I don't like the song.
Holy Christ....
What the hell are you doing?
All the time....
Listen to Carla...Marry me...I'm tall, dark and handsome...two out of three ain't bad....
Don't go weak in the knees on me tonight....
She's in management....
Cow tipping?
Yes, she will. You see if she isn't. And I'm gonna get you a nice pink dress that'll go with your brown eyes.
Did you bring it with you?
Not today .. I'm on a diet to- day .. I'll take a diet soda ..
What time is it?
It's a technique I read about. If you smoke 60 a day, you buy three packs, throw one cigar- ette away, and smoke 59. Day 2, you throw 2 away and smoke 58 ..
Where is everyone?
I haven't got it.
Six girls over a period of 18 months, and give or take a head or two, the M.O.'s exactly the same. Dark hair. No hands. All shot with a high velocity twen- ty-two in the back of the head.
You believe me, don't you?
God, it pisses me off, Ross.
I'm already familiar with Taylor's opinion.
Jesus. What are you doin?
Now?
Listen, you don't havta come?
How do you know her hair's black?
What do you want me to do, Chief?
Have you got a match on the bullet?
I'm shutting you down on this "blind thing," John.
I'll sign anything you want. <u>Please</u>. Bring here her .. <u>I want Helena here</u> ..
Week or two.  Musta been on the ker- osene.  Stinks like a diesel engine.
I've told you the truth. It isn't me .. I've never call- ed Ross "Freddy" in my life ..
Yes, Sir.
Well, I think I told you on the phone .. I went up to her room to say good-bye, and we just sat on the bed and chatted a while, while her friend was coming in and out collecting her things ..
No.
The elevator wasn't working?
Can I see your hands?
Sorry?
You know? How do you know?
Why can't I stay with you?
Coz he thinks you're a witness.
You do?
I think they're gonna arrest me.
What are you doing, Travis?
Why?
You got a warrant for this?
And you got <u>no</u> <u>idea</u> with who?
What does that mean?
You think he still loves her?
So tonight she confesses?
No it isn't .. It's Californian ..
Shut up, King Jay ..
You know.  I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Who told you?
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Listen to me!
Didn't hear it.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Don't let him stay up too late.
Let me think about that.  Want something to drink?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario.  It's big.
You hear those courtesy laughs, Jerry? There is a seething wrongness at the edges of this party.
Can I help?
I know who y6u are.  You're Dorothy Boyd.  You're in... wait... you're in Accounts.  You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Well, thanks.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
But I mean really... wonderfully...  great.
... light.
It's all going to work.  We're going to save the world.
Truth?
Well.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
Oh God.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
If I said that, would you stay?
Why do you love me?
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
What if it's true?  "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on.  It's the theme of my bachelor film --
I don't like to give up.
What about medical?
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
He's coming over.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Forgot your keys --
I'm sorry, I --
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity.  I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby.  Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS.  Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
At last I find you.
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
You love me now, don't you?
What are you doing with me, Rod?
You are not allowed to act this way.
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, tell the story.
Which they do.  And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew.  So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies.  We're getting married in February.
You gonna get that --
Marcee --
I'm sorry what I said back there.
He took a shot.  He's unconscious.
Keep the phone open.  I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
I'm fine.  What's up?
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo.
I won't tell.
I don't see any.
Show me the animal, Jerry!
...once-in-a-lifetime.
Amanda, Honey! Dr. Grant says it's a bad idea!
Her new boyfriend.
You hate to swim.
No, Dr. Grant says...
What did you say?
I'm sorry Amanda. I am. And I'm sorry for the things I said about him.
I know you liked Ben. I had no right to...
It's not safe.
We can't just stop looking. Eric and Dr. Grant are out there somewhere.
Eric, its okay. You'll be right behind me.
Paul! Where is he? Can you see him?
I thought we weren't suppose to yell.
We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
Where's Dad?
We have to keep looking for Dad. We have to.
Let me tell you a few things about you Dad, okay? He's very very very clever, very very brave, and he loves you ever very much.
He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island.  Right?
Absolutely not.
Even with what I pay you, you could get a better bag.
That does sound lucky.
I'm so use to seeing bones. It's weird to see skin.
How would you classify it?
He used to know me.
So, Mark's working at the State Department now.
We've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. I have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. The way they can work together as a team.
Okay. Goodbye, Ellie.
They'll never make it. I mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.
You're Alan Grant, aren't you?  I read both of your books.
We need to head for the coast.
The lady you called, how do you know she can help us?
It's strikes me now I never told her that.
There is no Kirby Enterprises, is there?
Amanda!
But alone?  We always had great success together, you and I.
Any damage?
You think I'm all talk, Eddie?
Why didn't you tell us about these guys, Ian?!
What?
No, no, no, no, no, no . . .
I'm not going, John.
Oh --
Ian, you're not insane!  I'm so glad!
Hi, Dad.
You know, at the bus stop.  With the hair?
I could come with you.
I don't care about the trials, I want to be with you.  I could be your research assistant, like I was in Austin.
"InGen."  What's InGen?
Carnivores hunt near stream beds.  Do you want to set up base camp or an all-you-can-eat people bar?
Where do you think you're going?!
You rally think this'll draw the parent?
Killing lessons?  Heartwarming.
What is?
The radio rig is inside.  It runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.
If I don't move, I can't shoot it.
So, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?
What?
Come on!
No!  We're an independently funded expedition.
The kid scores with cheap sentiment.
You've got to be kidding.
I found a way to re-route through the program.  I'm turning the cars around in the rest area loop.
But would we get the phones back?
You shouldn't use my name.
That's up to your guy on the boat.  Seven o'clock tomorrow night, at the east dock. Make sure he got it right.
Paleo-DNA?  From what source?  Where do you get 100 million year old dinosaur blood?!
Yes.  We know they're toxic, but the animals don't eat them.
There you are.  Out you come.
Fascinating animals, fascinating.
Carousel.
A drought.  The lake was shrinking - -
Well, not one of those, well yeah, a possibly one at some point could be a good thing.  What's so wrong with kids?
Oh my god, they do not!  They don't smell.
The what?
Anything else, you old fossil?
Okay, who's the jerk?
Why would they care what we think?
Ellie, they're absolutely - - they're moving in herds. They do move in herds!
So what are you thinking?
Oh, shit.
Oh Ellie.  It's so beautiful.  It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.
It's just the two raptors, right?  You're sure the third one's contained?
Ellie, get the gun!  Try to reach the gun!
They show extreme intelligence, even problem solving. Especially the big one.  We bred eight originally, but when she came in, she took over the pride and killed all but two of the others.  That one - -when she looks at you, you can see she's thinking  working things out.  She's the reason we have to feed 'em like this. She had them all attacking the fences when the feeders came.
Ellie, com one!!
What about the lysine contingency?  We could put that into effect!
I can't wait anymore.  Something went wrong.  I'm going to go get the power back on.
I'm going with you.
Come on, let's go.
It's all right.
That's right.  Will break through.
Uh - - thumb!  The same way.
Oh, imperfections?
Alan?
Hammond hates inspections.  They slow everything down.
If two experts sign off on the island, the insurance guys'll back off.  I already got Ian Malcolm, but they think he's too trendy.  They want Alan Grant.
Why not?
The full fifty mile of perimeter fence are in place?
Tim.
These look kind of familiar.
I threw up.
Me too.  Okay.  Well, the main thing about climbing is never, never look down, never.
Take a bite, take a bite.  I'm not letting go.
Go, go, go, jump!
to Grant) She's, uh - - tenacious.
What'd I touch?!
Yeah, they hate me.
Hey, we were saving that!
Well, I'm afraid I do.  There's one, a particular pebble in my shoe.  He represents my investors.  He says they insist on outside opinions.
That thing's got a what, twenty-five, twenty-seven foot neck?
Blood temperature feels like high eighties.
Tim!  Lex!
Hear that?  Are you hearing this?
Tim, Tim, Tim....
Go away!
John doesn't subscribe to Chaos, particularly what it has to say about his little science project!
Don't do that!
Your silence intrigues me.
I think perhaps I'll just sit down.  I don't suppose you think all that much of me now, do you?
I am totally unappreciated in my time.  We can run the whole park from this room, with minimal staff, for up to three days.  You think that kind of automation is easy? Or cheap? You know anybody who can network eight Connection Machines and de-bug two million lines of code for what I bid this job?  Because I'd sure as hell like to see them try.
Well?
Robert - - I wonder if perhaps you would be kind  good enough to take a gas jeep and bring back my grandchildren.
What's going to happen to the goat?  He's going to eat the goat?!
I'm sorry - - I'm sorry - -
You're gonna get electrocuted  electrified!  The power's coming back!
I don't think the people who live around here would like that very much...
Beautiful trees... sturdy trunks... lots of branches...  We can do some great logging up here.
Okay... well... I think it's this way...
Other guy?
I seem to recall arguing the same thing in court while you were trying to file murder-one charges.
Ruby, come on. You witnessed a brutal triple murder and you're having trouble accepting it.  Think about what you're saying. You really expect a jury to believe that Jason has a mystery killer living in his tummy?
It's still on.
Great. Is that what you're going to say when I put you on the stand?
That's the problem with this case. Everyone thinks they know Jason's life story. But they don't. What you're remembering is a _movie_. Fiction.	In the movie, Jason's mother runs around, killing people after Jason drowns in Crystal Lake
Oh?
Fascinating.
Uh-huh...
Then I'd say we should put Jason under again... run another tape on him and see what happens. We'll get extra data this time. Video... infrared... the works.
This is Jason's REM pattern... and this is the boy's REM pattern. They're identical.
So Krueger thinks Jason's dead... leaves him in the lake... but the boy actually wakes up on the shore... crawls off into the woods... where he lives the rest of his life alone.
If I'm right, this happened before the Krueger murders in Springwood.  That means that Jason might've been Krueger's first victim.
You know how to use one of those?
It's only majestic from here. When you get closer you see it for what it really is.
Fine -- terrible.
Preliminary investigations may already be underway.
-- Ah, but what if it <u>wasn't</u>?
I've read your stories.  They're fantastic.
Where do you get your ideas?  Only joking -- I'm just joking.  Let's go to a brothel then, Kafka, come on.
-- Oh, yes, determination runs in the family.
I'm trying to find things out myself -- that's the whole point.
The cemetery is nearer the Castle than anywhere else -- wasn't it part of the Castle originally?  -- I always assumed there'd be a gate or something.  Isn't there?
You didn't give it to <u>me</u>.
It's what I'm paid to do.
To do my work well, I have little time for --
I did not realize it was obligatory.
-- Eduard --
I'm Kafka -- I work upstairs in Accident --
You're a friend of Eduard Raban's.
What's funny?
How long were you and Eduard --
No, I don't.  I'm amazed that anyone is able to bear life with any assurance at all.
You almost married recently, didn't you?
-- I don't know the Musil district.
Ah -- we're back to the "authorities" you spoke of.
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
When was the last time you saw Mr. Raban?
Did you go anywhere afterwards -- to have a drink perhaps?
Grown men don't normally fall into the river, do they?
But that's just my point -- she was more than upset, she was livid. She slammed every door on her way downstairs -- except that one.  I was just behind her and I didn't even hear that one <u>shut</u> -- not at all.
My assistants.  I should have known. Nothing is given to me.  I have to acquire everything.
-- You said so yourself the firm is large and powerful.  If the discrepancy really was something big, Eduard's responsibility would still have to be small.  No poor young <u>clerk</u> could find himself in such a fix.
... A piece of paper ...
Through a very unfortunate -- and I might add extremely rare -- mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other.  And for the first time -- though your friend wasn't aware of it -- two and two could have been put together to make one.
"Raban" -- that'll be nearly at the back of the alphabet.
It's gone out so quickly?
I did read that.  They gave him a posthumous medal.
What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
But your goal is so hard to reach. Do you think the official network would surrender to one man?  We would never think of attempting anything remotely as difficult.
I hope it fits ... Mrs Denham's a big lady.
I thought that with your assistance we could have the premiere at the Albert Hall. We'll take out a full page ad in Variety - "The Lord Darrow Benefit screening". We'll invite the King of England - hell, we'll get the whole Royal Family along! It'd be good for them and good for us!
Get the hell out of here.''!
Now look at this fine example of early Hindu art ... I don't recall any sketches of this passing across my desk ...
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Man Eater!!!
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
They were just tasting the berries.
I'm calling a wrap. We're heading back to the ship.
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Did you fear for your life?
Bree -- honey - please, we're waiting for someone.
Why? She's a junkie.
Mm.
-- May I? It's so --
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
-- I have to close up now. Leave your name and number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don't you just go home and wait until he --
What was better? I made better bait?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
What about the other things you've reported? --  -- being followed on the --
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
Well do you think it was him?
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
Is there anything more I could --
You said it was!
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
How can you do it to yourself?
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
Is that all you have to say?
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
Where, how?
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
That who?
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
What?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Well --
It's a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I don't envy you that humidity in the city.
I'm sure the FBI and the Police explored that possibility.
Thank you. Goodbye, John.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann.  Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
Not unusual.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
Well?
Think this is our guy?
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
Why couldn't you ever find out anything from the girl?
Where is the child?
Does that distress you?
What does?
That's Kim...and this one's Thelma and that's Mrs. Willewska and this is daddy and that's Batman and over there is Robin.
Greatest.
Show.
I'll tell you what, kiddo--why don't I fix us some French toast?
What about my orange juice?
Mom, I mean dad...
Mom, I mean dad...
I'm sorry.
There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger.
Yes?
Ohhh...Ohhhh...Ohhhhh...
Wow!
Wow!  That's neat.   Can I sit in it?
What did you do when you were little?
Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father.  Now there is a man who is very wise.  He's called a judge.  And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with.
Objection!  I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.
Are you introducing the question of negligence here, counselor?
This is an isolated incident, counselor, unless you can prove otherwise.
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?
Tell me, Mrs. Kramer, are you employed at the present time?
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated.  I needed to talk to somebody.  I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what.  But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it.  He became very...I don't know, very threatened.  I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack.  Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another.  Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem...  At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me.  It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person.  And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
Objection, your honor.  The answer is, to be generous, very vague.
Objection, your honor!  Counsel is harassing the witness.
Ted was a good worker.  But, ah... ... after his wife left him and he was taking care of the kid on his own, things started to change. Look, I know he had problems, I understand that.  I've got problems, everybody's got problems.  But I've got a shop to run, I can't let that kind of thing get in the way...  I guess I felt that Ted was letting his duties at home interfere with his responsibilities in the office.
Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm...  Well, this looks very good.. Of course  ... you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job.
I don't recall.
I thought you might just like to know that at five-fifteen this afternoon we were officially handed the Fire and Ice account by Revlon.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child.  I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get.  Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink.  Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Wow!
Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay?  Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay?  But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.  Just until you get yourself straightened out.
Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods.  Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
'Night, Jim.
What the hell is this?
Jim, this is garbage.  This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about.  None of it. You can't--
Disappointing.  It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty-five minimum, and...ah...they're not very happy and...Well, the guys have decided they want to...ah, re-think the entire concept and...Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But...I mean, what I mean is...ah, I'm going to have to...ah, let you go--
Hiya, Phyllis.  These are the Revlon contracts.  I thought you ought to check them out.
Kramer, I've got to go.  I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right?
And?
It's a very good job--too good to pass up.  I'll be handling funding for the whole...  Look, I...  ..."like" you a lot.  And you...  ..."like" me, okay?  Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
What?
Mr. O'Connor called.  There's a meeting with the Revlon people in the board room and you're fifteen minutes late.
Mr. Schmidt can't have the figures on the television buy until Monday.
Look, Ted, I don't honestly think she would go to the trouble of suing you for custody of the child if she was planning on kidnapping him.
Ted?  They've set the court date. I just heard today...It's...  January sixth.
John?
I came home tonight.  We just got the Fire and Ice account at the agency.  Do you know what that means?!  Do you understand what that means?  It means that it was maybe one of the five best days in my whole life.
Boy, you guys are really something, y'know?  I'd like to know one thing, okay--just one little thing.  Did you tell Joanna she should leave me?
Y'know something Thelma--you are the typhoid Mary of divorce. I mean it.  Joanna and I never had any trouble until you and Charley split up.
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid.  I don't need another one.  Got it?
You ever think about getting married again?
C'mon, Thel.  So Charley had a little fling.  So what? All in all he was a pretty good husband.
Please go away, Thel...I...I just have to be by myself for a little while...
Where are you from?
Mama, my story.
Not the way to talk to people.
Where will you keep them?
You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
Dalai Lama.
Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
Did you receive the letter?
So, we must face China and all her might alone.
Holiness?
Me. First break of day.
You did. We washed you and wrapped you in sheepskin and took you to your father. That day the father got better. And that day, a pair of crows came to nest in our roof. I just remembered.
Do I have money?
You can't do anything real until you are Dalai Lama.
May I listen to the news with you, Holiness?
Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
Has anyone died?
I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
The crowd will not disperse until you give your assurance that you will not attend the Chinese festivities. Many who have been invited to dine with the Chinese do not return home.
We are now accused of aiding the rebels. The Chinese said we can expect drastic measures to be taken to crush this revolt.
Well, some say. It's not for you to worry about. Another will be chosen.
Me?
This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.
What do you think?
Why is this? What is happening? Tell me!
You have grown up very good.
Tell me.
Don't eat all those sweets. You'll get sick.
This is not a fight to put bread just in one's own mouth. This is a fight for Tibet.
Hmm.
Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're up here... a man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.  Do you know how your husband died?
Ma'am, how could you not report this?  He puts human life at risk and--
I'll sue you.
Wait just a second.  You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.
They've been migrating north, Kelly, this lake connects to the ocean,--
I really don't mean to be discourteous.  But how is it a person could come to believe that a crocodile is in New England?
We are here on official business.
I keep telling you, they <u>can</u> come on land, I don't wanna wake up in the middle of the night--
I brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.
Promise you won't kill me, first.
What's that?
That <u>sounds</u> good but underneath it's hurtful.  Nightcap?
I can arrest you!!
Gee, that would really disappoint me.
Where is he?!
Keep enough tension to hold him up, Hector, we don't know if he can swim.
She didn't tell us about the other croc 'cause she was afraid we'd blow it's head off.
Hector.  What you just did... there was at least some sort of a death wish going on.
You're gonna be okay.
Kelly Scott.
How big do the bears get?
He could be right there and you wouldn't see him.
Hard to believe there could be a monster under such peacefulness.
Like little children.  You okay?
I couldn't believe... did you see the size of that thing's mouth?
Hector!!
You sure?  I don't mind...
If I'm ever in New York...
You think?
That was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now I'll be able to tell him if you can.
We set?
I'm ready when you are.
What's that?
They won't be here till at least noon.  We got a few hours to kill.
He just kinda gurgled.  He was pretty much dead.
This is a little different.
<u>What</u> <u>is</u> <u>that</u>?
You're sort of a rude person.
We don't mean to invade your privacy but... was he ill, was he sick?
What?
Was that like a homo-sexual remark?
<u>What</u>?  I don't even <u>know</u> the guy.
If he gets close, you go <u>up</u>, Hector, don't you endanger that cow.
I had a great time last night. Again.
Kevin, as long as we...  What was that last part?
Yeah, that part.  There's... somebody who's um...
<u>Oh</u>...  No, no, I'm not angry I'm not, I'm just thrown, I'm...  I actually have an early lunch, so...
<u>You</u>?
You don't know what to say, lucky for you action speaks louder than words.
But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
"- every day."
You're all right! Where is he?
What you're doing, Miss Starling, is coming into my hospital to conduct an interview, and refusing to share information with me. For the third time!
Mr. Krendler... Dr. Lecter trusts me. Or at least, he used to. If I could just -
He gave us a perfectly good description, and we're on it now, so we won't be needing your little novelty act any longer - or his, either. He's under close guard at the courthouse, pending a prison transfer. The next plane, Officer.
Mr. Yow, if this door should fall down -ha ha! - or anything else - would you be kind enough to call this number? It's our Baltimore field office. They know you're here with me... Do you understand?
Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car.
I'm investigating the death of Fredrica Bimmel. Who are you, please?
Mr. Gordon, did you take over this place after Mrs. Lippman died?
Your instructors tell me you're doing well. Top quarter of the class.
Yes, well... Okay, right. I'm glad for the chance, sir, but - why me?
I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out?
Every word, Starling? Every gesture?
Well? Why aren't you there right now?
The orderly heard Lecter whispering to him, all afternoon, and Miggs crying. They found him at bed check. He'd swallowed his own tongue... Chilton is scared stiff the family will file a civil rights lawsuit, and he's trying to blame it on you. I told the little prick your conduct was flawless.  Starling...?
The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but -
But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to.
What would it take?
Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals.
He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor -
This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade...
And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies?
Oh sure, me'n Pam Malavesi used to help her do alterations for old Mrs. Lippman. Lots of people worked for her, she had the business from all these retail stores? But she was like, totally old, it was more'n she could handle.
Is that a pretty good job, FBI agent?
I am, yes.
Now then. What did Miggs say to you?  "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say?
Yes. That's the Duomo, seen from the Belvedere. Do you know Florence?
Partially, yes. But Doctor, that's an active case, I'm not involved. If -
It excites him. Most serial killers keep some sort of trophies.
And the questionnaire...?
Why don't you ask me about Buffalo Bill?
Your first lie to me, Clarice. How sad. Tell me - do you think Crawford wants you, sexually? True, he's much older, but - do you think he visualizes... scenarios, exchanges...? Fucking you?
Oh, a very naughty boy. Someone you and Jack Crawford are most anxious to meet.
She had an insect deliberately inserted in her throat. That hasn't been made public yet. We don't know what is means.
No. He was strong, he lasted almost a month. My mother - died when I was very young, so my father had become - the whole world to me... After he left me, I had nobody. I was ten years old.
Two months.
I thought you might want your drawings back... Just until you get your view.
No, he covets. That's his nature. And how do we begin to covet, Clarice? Do we seek out things to covet? Make an effort to answer.
No. It's your turn to tell me, Clarice. You don't have any more vacations to sell, on Anthrax Island. Why did you run away from that ranch?
I'll listen now. After your father's murder, you were orphaned. You were ten years old. You went to live with cousins, on a sheep and horse ranch in Montana. And - ?
So you ran away...
You still wake up sometimes, don't you? Wake up in the dark, with the lambs screaming?
Yes... I did.
Time, Pilch! My move.
Of course it counts. How do you play?
Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth...
Are you alright?
The men of the regiment will fetch water from the lake, build fires and provide every comfort you desire, Alice...
Though they are strangers, they are at least entitled to a Christian burial!
Why didn't you bury those people?
He did?
The Ottawa are gone.
The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man.
In this there is a chance. If I live, I can try to free you. If we don't go, there is no powder, there's too many of them.  Though my heart would keep me here, in that there is no chance. None. I can do nothing. Do you understand?
My letter...
One called Magua arrived.
Cora, I adore you and, when we come together, we will be the happiest couple in England...  I am certain of that. More than ever before.  I believe you must trust the judgment of others who hold your welfare so close to their hearts...
They do not live their lives "by your leave."  ...They hack it out of the wilderness with their own two hands, burying their dead and their children along the way.
Yes. Go ahead.
... compliments, Mr. Poe.  Take her and get out.
Colonel Munro sent him. He was one of our Mohawk allies.
That is the truth!
And if we're unlucky?
Any powder?
Folks here goin' to join in that fight?
I'll cover them from the top of the casement.
So the Huron are the servants of the French?  To do what the French are shamed to do?
A man, here, can make a run straight through to Webb.
I didn't experience anything so surprising from Bristol to Albany as what I witnessed here today.
The Crown "negotiating" the terms of service?
What a place for them...
Things were done. Nobody was spared...
Not with enough certainty to outweigh British interests in this fort.
I have lived to see two things I never expected.  An Englishman afraid to support a friend. And a Frenchman too honest to profit by that advantage.
Sir!
Yes.
Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake.  Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south.  And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
Colonel Munro, I have known you as a gallant antagonist. I am happy to make your acquaintance as a friend.
Please accept my compliments for the strong and skillful defense of your fortress. Under the command of a lesser man it would have fallen long ago given the superior numbers and material... mere chance has allowed me to array against you...
You have already done everything which is necessary for the honor of your Prince. I will forever bear testimony that your resistance has been gallant and was continued as long as there was hope. But now, I beg you to listen to the admonitions of humanity. I beg you to consider my terms for your surrender.
Such as...?
My colors?
C'est bien, vous vous promenez bien matin, monsieur!
Are you planning on working tomorrow?
What do you want me to say? That it all sounds mysterious?
Some say that's why we're basically hairless, for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds...
Be careful with it.
It's got Hazy!
That's why there's a dead one on the ship.  It ran out of blood.
No way...
I hit it.  But I can't see it!  Can you see it?!
Where the hell've you been?
Look at my foot, sir!  This bitch put a goddamn sea monster in my bunk!
Sixpack?
No.  I'm just being friendly.
Whatever made you want to do a tour down here?
They know, don't they?
What are you doing?
We're on backup air.
We made it!
Oh, God, she's out there...
Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...
How do you feel, DeJesus?
I can't tell you much about it, except that none of you show any symptoms.
Well, according to Maritime law, you, as commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.  However, the company doesn't want you to do that.
But you don't have any proof at this point to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?
Beck, trust me.  If the company felt that you or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.
Forty-eight hours!
Made your million, yet?
I'm telling you, it's the suits!
Cute, DeJesus...Specimen cups?
Yes sir...
C'mon, Cobb...you're slacking...
It's Sixpack!
Burritos...Enchiladas...
Yes sir, ain't that where we usually go when we're sick?
Clear for pickup.
Who were you talking to?
Bitch!  Look what you did!
Soap is called Soap because he likes to keep his hands clean of any unlawful behaviour. He is proud of his job, and even more proud that it's legal.
I'll kill him!
A month? So, my friend, what fucking good is that, if we need it in six . . . no, five days?
When the old bastard is not playing cards he's chasing a thousand debts that ill-fated individuals owe for an array of reasons.
The odds are one hundred to one so all we need is five grand.
Because it's cheap like a budgie.
Of course you will, sweetheart. This one, search this one. Ed finds the keys without any trouble.
The traffic warden went to the morgue and recognized Dog and his lot so that put us sort of in the clear. They got no case against us because there is no evidence against us.
Next time we do a job like this we gonna want more money, or we are going back to post offices and cars.
Shotguns? What, like guns that fire shot?
Oh, thanks very much. And there had better be something there for us.
Nope.
It's about time you give my young friends a visit, Chris. Tomorrow is the day and mum seems to be the word, and I can't have that now, can I, Chris?
They were going to pay, then?
Hello, John. Nice holiday?
Son?
It's in an office; I have just left it in the office. 137
It's not him, Dad.
That should take care of that lot. We are now officially in the money- loaning business, all right, son?
We gotta get those guns.
So we have a bit of a problem, don't we?
There's nothing to worry about, it's going to be easy.

Yeah, one of them's out.
Yeah invitations, you know a pretty white piece of paper with your name on it.
Well, what's going on?
Everything all right out there, Tom?
You and me, Tom.
Tom, this is our case.
I need two hundred and fifty grand.
That you, boy?
It's pay day, ain't it?
Go on.
Well, perhaps I can't, Plank, if you know what I mean.
Jesus, if I pick them up, will they stay in one piece? Where did you get them from?
Sawn-offs are out, Tom; people like to have a bit mare range nowadays.
So, a reasonable return should be in the region of one hundred and twenty, for twenty-five grand invested. That's going on previous experiences.
Well Jesus, that wasn't so bad, was it?
You would take a pain ín the arse full stop.
And those stupid girls who hang out with them--
I don't know what the big deal is.
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
That makes it okay?
And what did she do?
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
Who's "they"?
Please.
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Why don't you start with that?
So you knew this young man before?
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Did you know he was going to be there last night?
You and one hundred nineteen other fortunate individuals. Put it in gear.
Sam the Man.
How's business?
Skinny?
Nice job.
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
Whole different story; isn't it?
You look good--
Suppose not.
350 pounds.
Come on in--
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
So I'm part-Indian?
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
I have a B average.
How's your room shaping up?
Recycling, right? We invented that. The government doesn't have to tell people to do it.
Cliff--
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
Mikey--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
That where he was shot?
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection.
Donde esta? Estoy perdido--[Where are you? I'm lost--]
No puedo ver la orilla! [I can't see the bank!]
Es muy lindo, su coche--
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
This girl is a friend of yours?
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
I haven't been out here for a while.
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
He still living?
Besides my father, I mean.
Morning, Hollis.
I got an idea what happened.
There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail--
The old-high-school-heartthrob Sheriff. I thought you were crazy about each other. He's available, you're available--
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
Right. When he was killed.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
Could of been. That was white people's business.
Mom?
Just 'cause you went to Catholic school and wore a uniform.
How come?
That's how I ruined my stomach.
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
You built our patio while you  were on the county?
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Your mother still doesn't like me.
People liked him.
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
I should get back.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
Yeah?
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
We start from scratch--
Haven't seen much of you at the jail lately.
What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law--
--but longhorns are hard to come by these days.
As I remember it was because he had a sassy mouth on him. Must run in the family--You wouldn't be runnin' numbers out of this club, now, would you, son?
You going to tell her?
Hello, L.A.
I'm sure they'll have this place rigged.
You ever been married?
Why?
Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is?
That's Butterfield...
Thanks, Billy.
How'd you spell that again?
D'Amour.
You did.  Didn't you?
Who did this?
You didn't think it was just going to be you and me?  A lot of people believed in Nix. They haven't forgotten his promise.
Death.
Oh Christ!  Oh Christ!
I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time.
So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you?
Harry.
Are they treating you okay?
Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
I can be very persuasive.
They were jealous of him.
He... didn't have me..  I told you-
What about Jennifer Desiderio?
Flesh is a trap.  That's what he used to say.  Flesh is a trap and magic sets us free.  Why did you come back?
You said you weren't with him for love.
What then?
I was so afraid.
I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him.
No!  No!  No!
... they believe you.
No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
I'm going back to New York in--  Shit!  I'm outta here.
Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is?
When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician.
Why'd you come here?
Are you satisfied now?
Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake.
Him too.
I'm sorry, D'Amour...
You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you.  You don't like that.
Are they all in the business?
Oh yeah?
I can do a lot of shit, D'Amour. But you know that.  So I like playing games with people.  Gives them something to wonder about...
He had something.  He showed me how to bend the rules.  A little levitation.  A few fireworks.
Did she know where Nix was buried?
... no...
That's where we're all going.
One question.
Yes! Yes!
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
I'm thinking about it.
Hi again, how's it going?
Oh, hi.
Not really. How long are you here for?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Hans was very attentive to you.
Really?
Did I scowl at you?
I don't remember.
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
What happened to your toe?
It's bad isn't it?
Do you know where we are?
I'm sorry.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Mr. Kazuzo sent me.
Lydia?
I don't know.
You know, eat healthier.
Not all that pasta.
Hello?
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
It's ok.
I guess she's busy.
Hello?
Great.
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
I don't know what to do.
See you later.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
John! What are you doing here?
It's amazing  there!
Uh..thanks.
You never said anything to me...
Shi... Sorry, honey.  I was having the weirdest dream.
Uh...sure...I...what?
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
Yes.
Seemed...on edge.
He asked to go home early.  He said he was bothered by all the people who kept telling him what to do.
When your secretary called, she made no mention of her coming, too.
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
You'll do it?
He spoke to you?
Peter.  Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
You fucking bastard.
Why are you doing this to me?
What do you mean "don't worry?"
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
Oh my God!
Yes... and you are?
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you.  Listen, Ms...?
I'll bet.
So...what did you think of the tape.
So what'd I miss?
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him.  What the fuck is going on?
And the point is?
Peter, let go of the chair!
Close call.  For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend.  Get rid of me.  I would've...
I've dealt with these people before, Maya.  They're not going to help us.
It's useless...look at him.
Good of you to stop by.
It's as if you are saying the closer you get to evil, the less evil it becomes.
Not even from some mental illness, as the prosecution asserts?
Are you saying he's legally sane?
What's the matter with you?
Thanks for handling this.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you.  Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
Monica, what did you do?
I hate it.
That's not funny
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
Engaged.
Whatever.
There you go.
No I don't.
That's not it.
What are you talking about?
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
What?
I'm an English major.  You like English?
Quincy, word has it you might make the jump the NBA.
But you'd love for him to play at USC, like you did.
I don't know sometimes.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
And he's fine, girl.
What's up?
Thanks.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
You ever think about going back?
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
Didn't know you cared so much.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
See you made it.
You having fun?
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though.  So who is this clown?
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
Why?
What was that about?
Forget Tonya Randall.
Then prove her wrong.
That was so weak.
Clothes.
Give me the ball.
I won.
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
You weren't at my game.
We're going to get some food.
Least you got your priorities straight.
You're what?
So that's it, just forget about us?
So...I guess I'll see you around.
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
So...how's the knee?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
Like what?
You asked me what was missing.
Give it yourself.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
Yeah.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that.  How you been?
Whose truth are you talking about?
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
Yeah?  So you up for a game later?
You don't wanna hurt your back.
You work too hard, Pop.
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices.  You don't have a choice.
there's this thing out there.  This paternity suit.
Why?
What's Mom think?
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
I ain't a damn liar.
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you.  I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
What do you want?
Don, you got hit by lightning that time in Tahoe, you went on vacation, I don't think braces is a good idea --
You smell like trouble --
Jimmy you look like you're about to fuckin' die right here --
Well, ok.  Lemme see how I explain this without it seeming kinda crazy, but here go:  I'm, my name is Phil Parma and I work for a man named Earl Partridge -- Mr. Earl Partidge. I'm his nurse.  He's a very sick man. He's a dying man and he's sick and he's asked me to help him, to help him find his son -- Hello?  Are you there, hello?
Why don't they have the same last name? They don't have the same last name.
What kind of Cancer?
My mother had breast cancer.
Don't sit down.
FUCK YOU.  YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
Please put your clothes on, please --
Honey.
Your mother wants to hear from you --
Yes.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
Yeah.
Yeah.
got some coffee brewing, huh?
I like iced coffee, generally, but a day like this, rain and what not, I enjoy a warm cup --
Is this boyfriend bothering you?
The gentleman who came to the door --
Ok, ok. I'm back.
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
No. No.  Don't joke about that. That's not funny, Claudia.  Please, now.
Great, bye.
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
So you've done it --
Why not?
You really use strong language.
It's fine.
-- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
I lost my gun.
I'm sorry --
It's ok.
I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
Just say no.
What's your name?
Hello.  You're back again, huh?
What?
Not enough, what do you want?
Can you hold it?
I have to go to the bathroom, Cynthia.
What happend, what's going on?
Richard, shut it and keep it down.
BULLSHIT, BULLSHIT DAD WE GOTTA GET HIS MONEY --
DAD --
Oh, you're a rapper, huh?  You got a record contract?
You look like you've got money in your pocket.
Just throw some money around. Money, money, money.
Do you have love in your heart?
....do you know who I am?
That's right.
Things go round 'n round, don't they?
I confuse melancholy and depression sometimes....
I'm sick.
I'm sick and I'm in love.
I lent my name, my celebrity. Exactly --
You don't need braces.
I've been a good worker --
...ah...
She's a good girl.  She's a little nuts, but she's a good girl I think. She's a little daffy.
Other fuckin' assholes like me.
Do me a personal favor --
...gimme that fuckin' phone...
Do you know Lily?  Phil..do you know her?
I think you have the wrong number.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
-- just to clarify --
This isn't meant --
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
She does.  From when you were a boy.
She lived in Tarzana.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
Where are you from originally?
Why does that sound silly?
I wouldn'tve asked --
Do you have your masters?
Where does that name come from?
It's not your given name, right?
And "Frank?"
Kind of.
She's not here, she went out. I'm sorry.  This is all just so, I don't know what, what to do -- your Dad asked me to try and track you down. To get you and I did, I called the number -- Do you wanna come in?
I've heard your tapes on the phone.
It's interesting.
Can you stand...back...maybe, I mean... just a little bit...in the room is ok, but back from us a little...
There's no disturbance.
I didn't do anything.
You on any medication?
Will you say my name?
Come and tell me it's over and I'll walk away, Jimmy.  I've fucked you behind your wife's back for three years, and you've fucked teenage girls behind mine for the same amount of time -- I'll walk away, you need something for your life, for your conscience, but don't put me in the middle --
What happend to you?
You want her right now?
What were you saying, Stanley?
I don't mean to cry, I'm sorry.
How you doing?
...No...I don't hate you.  Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
She thinks terrible things that somehow got in her head...that I might have done something.  She said that to me last time...when it was...ten years ago she walked out the door, "You touched me wrong..." "I know that." Some crazy thought in her, in her head...
Yes you do.
I'm sorry.
Was it a call back?
If we beat the record, you might get a call back --
What does that mean?
-- that can't happen.  Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
I've got Frank...Frank Earl's son. He's...he asked me to get him and I did --
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
Pink Dot.
yeah, I said.  Is that it?
Let's go,let's go, let's go, you shoulda done that ten minutes ago --
Be ready at two --
You ready to keep winning?
I think that you have to be nicer to me.
I'm sorry to put all this on you, Stanley --
...what...?
No, M'lady.
There were two.  Not one.  But two.
What is it, mother?
He is dead!  By God's choice!  There is nothing to discuss.
Prison was horrible but it was his home.  He's been torn from it by strangers.  He's frightened, exhausted -- and the mask is familiar.  Let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.
Then you are a fool -- a fool who has never lost a son.  What gives you the right to judge me, to play God with the lives of others?  Is it because you are so much holier than everyone else?!
How is he?
Three days.
Perhaps.  But of d'Artagnan I am certain.  What he did tonight was what he told us all along he would do -- be faithful to his King.
A simple theological discussion.
Please revel with me, Aramis, I need my spirits lifted.  I'm old, I'm weak, my strength is gone --
Forgiveness.
The child of the king is... the king.  Louis!
Coming?
Let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!
He's going to kill you, Aramis.
But what if something extraordinary happened?  Something so unusual that all the attention went to someone else?  Someone whose confirmation of Phillippe the King would never be questioned.
D'Artagnan watches everything.  We have to be lucky.
He gets one day of confession each year.  Today is the day.
What choice is there?  If Phillippe is in the Bastille, then to the Bastille we will go.
Goodbye, father.  I am sorry.
D'Artagnan!
I have ordered a drill of the Royal Guard for midnight, and must be clear-headed for it.
I heard your playing.
You knew this was happening.  You knew and that's why you came.
Raoul is everything to me.
I will also speak with the King, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to Mademoiselle Beaufort has caused.
I've worn this mask so long, I couldn't sleep without it.
I am so sorry!  Forgive me, I --
These rooms are yours.  Up these stairs -- or through this hidden passage -- is the room of your mistress... Michelle.
Phillippe...?
Are you hungry?
This place... I once lived in a country house.  I had guardians -- an old man and woman.  And tutors. But no friends.  Then when I was twelve, they came and took me to the prison.
A man in black.  I never saw his face.  He took me to the cell.  A blacksmith came and they put me into the mask.  For days I shouted, "What have I done?  Why do you do this to me?"  But no one heard, so I just stopped shouting.
The plans for use of the maze were not disclosed to me.
Then you must allow me to stay close to you so that --
That is my desire, and my desire is what should concern you, not the sentiments of some commoner!
What quaint notions, d'Artagnan! But they contradict my father, who picked his queen when he was old, and only then to bear me.
Silence!  I order you!
I will consider it.  Now leave me.
Not once have I ever asked anything for myself.  I ask now.  Forgive this man, this prisoner... your brother.
Where is Michelle?
Food, moron.
Do you want Athos arrested, your Majesty?
Sire!  I -- How did you --
Alright, we know who we're looking for.  Play it cool until the time is right to make a move.  Let's not pull any gangbusters shit or we'll lose him again.
Why didn't you call for back-up! What were you thinking, Jesus!!!
I don't know how you're used to doing things, Marvosa, but it sounds like some damn sloppy work to me!
Did you hit him?
Find out for me.
I'll take the south end -
So you must have known Fleming... and Stanton -
Outside hacker?  What the fuck are you talking about?
Hell, he probably raped her in the lot, dumped the body somewhere. That's what he was like - a real wacko.
Vice...you think they had something to do with this dead hooker?
And where the hell is Marvosa?
Where is he?!!
And what did you do?
No...I'm in some trouble...
Operator, I'd like to make a collect call - 213-467-0972...
Holy shit -
Oh, shit, shit, shit - I don't know about all this! You sure?!
I hope you haven't lost your touch with this stuff.
Are you a regular there?
What would your - boyfriend - think?
Where am I going?
Oh yeah?  You're a smart man?...
If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself.  What are you planning, Jack?
Sidney: I don't understand him.  We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience.  To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming'... but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming.  The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me.  Why the mirrors?
They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student.  He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
No.  The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code.  And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here...
Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces.  None of them knew that;
If you can't look anymore, I understand...
Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat.
Jack, this is Graham. Is Price still in Latent Prints?
We find an event that connects both families. Same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. Then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...  If we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.
Is it weird?
If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley...
How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop?  Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds!
We know the Tooth Fairy reads the Tattler. The stuff about me and Lector? I don't know any other paper that carried it...
Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
Who is it?
When are you coming back?
He changes them into beings that accept him... And he needs to see the acceptance, In the mirrors.  I didn't understand the mirrors before.  It's very important.
It's a word. Killing them...  His delusion is: if he sees himself accepted enough times, he will become as one who has the power to be accepted all the time.  And he would record it somehow. So he can see himself received over and over again...
There has to be.
Something Lecktor said.
I'll cover the back.
There's somebody in the house, Jack...
...but if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What?
Where the hell's Graham!
Come on in.  How about a gin and tonic?
Good morning...  If you show me where things are, I'll make us some coffee...
Reba...
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT!
No, Mr. Lounds. You'll be just fine.
Burned? Burned. No. You just rest there. I'll be right back.
'No' what?
Are you queer, Mr. Lounds?
Now you will read this into the tape recorder.
Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you?
It's Will Graham...
Can you read it to me?
Linda King's desk.
Okay.
He's misunderstood.
Which part? That or the day-to-day.
I'm thinking about painting the kitchen. What color do you like, Will? Are you there?
Do you remember what you said?
Can you quit?
What will you do?
Is Crawford going with you?
Today's Wednesday. By Friday I ought to...
Lt. Fisk said...
Will it keep them out?
Crabs would get most of the newborns before they made it to the sea, huh?
Are you gonna kill him?
She got all right?
And how is Officer Stuart? The one who was the first to see my basement.
It doesn't matter to me, Will.
Pray tell.
I don't believe in God.
Glaser Safety Slugs?
Hey, I really enjoyed your set.
Sitcom...?
B-but, this is classy... they did Bob Newha--
Andy?
Tell you what.  I'll book you on some concerts, and meanwhile, we'll show the Special around... see if somebody wants to buy it --
When you play the Midwest and South, you DON'T MINDFUCK THESE PEOPLE! It's not postmodern -- it's rude.  If you wanna perform in Texas, you give 'em Mighty Mouse!  You give 'em Elvis!!
We were just trying to push the envelope --
So how can I help you...?
I don't care about the money.  I just want the show to deliver.
Tony Clifton.
I can't move my arm.
So, Mr. Besserman, same slot tomorrow...?
You're firing me??  You don't even pay me!
What do you want?  "Take my wife, please"??
B-but I have them.
Andy... uhh... this network has a long-standing policy: The viewer must be able to see the program.
What do you mean?
Hi...
Popcorn?
Andy, the theater's that way!
Why did you call me?  The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
And all this will be for real?
Jesus, Andy!  Can they cure it?
My father said I should've gotten a lawyer --!
Hey Andy, good show.
Give me the book.
Look at this!  An evil Russian! Ooo, here's an evil Nazi -- he likes to fight dirty!  Hey, here's an evil Japanese guy!
You know, I always wanted to be a bad-guy wrestler...
Well, call SAG.  It'd be cool to get one on the show.  I want the evening to build and build.  It's gonna have the most incredible ending: Singers, dancers, the "Hallelujah Chorus" -- then the sky opens, and Santa Claus comes flying down!
"Philosophically"?
Please!  You've GOT to let me take the classes!  It's how I keep myself BALANCED!!
Really?!  You want Tony Clifton to headline Harrah's Tahoe??
We had a deal!!
Yeah!!  I talked to Andy Kaufman!
Can I help you with something?
I'm worried about Andy.  His stress level is affecting his work.
Yeah, he's just laying low, waitin' for his comeback.  God, listen to this!  "It was morally wrong to take advantage of such an unstable individual..."
The great Morpheus.  We meet at last.
Don't be ridiculous.
You don't, do you?
Did you hear that?
I just keep wondering if Morpheus is so sure, why doesn't he take him to the Oracle?  She would know.
I don't believe it!  I don't believe it!
There was an accident.  A fucking car accident.  All of a sudden. Boom.  Jesus, someone's going to make a believer out of me.
All right --
I got a fibrillation!
Give me your phone.
How long?
Hello?
Holy fucking shit!
They got to you first, but they've underestimated how important you are.  If they knew what I know, you would probably be dead.
Why not?
Let me tell you why you are here. You have come because you know something.  What you know you can't explain but you feel it.  You've felt it your whole life, felt that something is wrong with the world. You don't know what, but it's there like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad.  It is this feeling that brought you to me.  Do you know what I'm talking about?
Why do my eyes hurt?
This isn't real?
We have only bits and pieces of information.  What we know for certain is that, at some point in the early Twenty-first Century, all of mankind was united in celebration.  Through the blinding inebriation of hubris, we marveled at our magnificence as we gave birth to A.I.
No!  I don't believe it!  It's not possible!
Do you know why you didn't make it?
This is another Matrix simulation. A training program to help you get your sea legs and teach you one very important lesson.
How does she know?
What did she tell you?
Listen to me, Neo.  I know why you're afraid to go through that door.  You can't get free of thinking that I could be wrong.  You must believe me.  There is a greatness inside of you, Neo.  A greatness that is going to lift you to unimaginable heights and that in time will change the world.
You're the Oracle?
Yeah.
I said don't worry about it.  I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
You're cuter than I thought.  I see why she likes you.
So?  What do you think?  You think you're the One?
Hello, Neo.
Of what?
Who is?
Uh-oh...
Are you all right?
What did you just say?
What is it?
Go!
What?
You moved like they moved.  I've never seen anyone move that fast.
Are you all right?
Okay.  Store's open.  What do you need?  Besides a miracle...
Yes.  They're moving him.  I don't know where yet.
We need an exit!
Tank, you're hurt.
Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth...
No.
Hey, come on...
Drinks for everybody Tony...
What happened to you Flash?
It's the truth, I swear.
You'd better make a move kid.  He thinks you're trying to screw him.
Hey...you got nothing here.
That's what I get for getting involved.  Look, on pay-day at least show up at Tony's Place to meet him, ok?  This way he doesn't think that you're trying to screw him.  If you show good faith and save his face maybe we can talk and he'll take off the interest or make different payment arrangements or something... understand?  I'm not asking I'm telling you!!
Listen, I should wrap up this place in a ribbon and hand it to him, you know that.  I don't need this aggravation.  I'm getting old.
Look...I don't know.  What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something?  Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head.  Right?
Michael, give us a lift.
Disgraceful.
Out!!!!
You getting out too?
Charlie, this is business.
I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it.
You're really crazy.
No, I'm serious...You're really good.
In a little while...I'm gonna have the opportunity of opening my own place...not here...much nicer than this...uptown...sort of nite-club and restaurant and everything.
Who me? ...No, I don't know, not me...all I know is...
I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that?
Well, maybe you missed something?
Wasn't a book...was a short story.
Nothing.
You know...like restaurants, night clubs...
Bore.
Take your time.  I don't care.
That W.A.S.P. bastard.
I'm going to take that apartment uptown.
Honey, I can't talk now...I've gotta run, bye.
and a double for you and Charlie here.  And put it on my tab, willya?
What'sa matter...forget your registration?
You mean it's heisted.
How much?
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
Look who's talking.
Have you got a minute?
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
What, honey?
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Who's Annie?
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
Honey, please.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Yeah, but --
We've met before, y'know, that White House function, the President had you on his right and you know where I was?
What are you eating.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
Hello, Beautiful.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
We have an arrangement now.
In my sleep.
'Yes'.
It's going to be great --
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money.  Joe is just... around.
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day.  Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
That's it?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either.  What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal.  No, thank you.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
And what do I get?
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited.  So what do you think, is it --  -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
Yeah.
Can't, sistah.
Not time yet.
No, I come to see Doctor.
Don' need you okayin'.
I've been buzzing you, Mr. Parrish. Are you all right?
You bet.  I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Come again?
Susan?
Goodnight, Joe.
Yes?
Oh goodness, no.
Very well, I'll watch.
Whatever you do.
She's in a great deal of pain.
Joe, I'm with Drew.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
How long have you been standing there?
Where are you going?
Thank you.
I like you in a black tie.
'Love will find out the way'?
What a good idea.
No --
How are you?  How're you feeling?
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy.  This is the left- field thing of all time.  What do I do?  What do I tell my family?
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
What's it like where I'm going?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over.  We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
I couldn't sleep.
And I don't give a shit.
Uh --
What the hell do you care?
Susan wants to come.  She says she's in love with me.
Okay.
I told you to shut up.
You are --?
Yes.
You want me to be your guide --?
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
Excuse me?  Could I say something?
'Yes' what?
What are you talking about?
Where are you?
Get what?
I'm sorry --
The 'question' --
Hi, Bill --
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for.  I just wanted to set the record straight.
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Oh yes, I am.  Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Aw, you're tough.
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
You're terrible.
What is it, Daddy --?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
That was wonderful.
Where's Joe?
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
I'm still here.  Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
Nothing lasts.
Why?
47.
Should I wear it?
What can I do for you, Leonard?
You don't know?
What makes you think he's my friend?
I'm sorry, I think I'm checked in here, But I've misplaced my key.
You don't have to be that honest, Burt.
I know you said you didn't want any calls...
Where'd you get it?
You're making a big fucking mistake. My associates are not people you want -
Is that what your little note says?
Then you shouldn't have to ask.
* So I'll take a picture, get a tattoo.			  * 							   * The world doesn't disappear when you			   * close your eyes, does it? My actions			   * still have meaning, even if I can't			    * remember them. My wife deserves				   * vengeance, and it doesn't make any				* difference whether I know about it.			    *
How do I know he did that to you?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
My wife used to call me Lenny.
Me? Why would he be interested in me?
What's wrong?
Neither do I.
How?
Don't talk about my wife.
Calm down.
Yes.
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking -
I believe that Sammy should be physically capable of making new memories.
Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out!
I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Francisco and I'm -
Lenny, is that you?
Things change.
It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
You're living.
Discount Inn. Don't know what room; haven't got my key.
What do you mean "bad news"?
My wife's death. I used to work in Insurance, we were well covered.
Yes, I do. I don't have amnesia. I remember everything about myself up until the incident. I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran -
How do you know him?
What's wrong?
This is a drug deal?!
He knew about Sammy. Why would I tell him about Sammy?							  *
My wife wasn't diabetic.
It is now.
Okay. We clean him up, untie him and			   * march him out with a gun in his back.			  *
Bullshit.							*
We know these people...!
Oh, yeah...
She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...?
...I didn't want you around the crime scene because it's crawling with federal law enforcement.  We don't know who's straight up, who's not...
Where's the new drop point...?
Just came in.  She's still alive.
We're not certain...
So...?
My end?
Put your guns on the table...  If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
I thought we had to meet the Man.
We want it back.
The Keys?
Havana?  Cubans don't like us or my business...
Were you born in Havana?
How's he not your husband?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Is it December?
Good samba dancing...?
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Hola, chica.
...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance.
Is this the protective male talk?
...in the morning.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail?  You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
Packaging?
Proof of life.  How do I know Mrs. Rico's alive?
People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?"
What do we got?
Verdado where?
Go ahead.
Detective Crockett.
4-4-7 Charlie 12-92.
OMGs, Mongols, Nazi Low-Riders, prison gangs?
How?
Yeah...?
They had me from the gate.
Correct.  Flash samples.  Flash cash.
Oh, good...
Break your encryption?  Hack your e- mail?  Employee databases? Somebody on the inside?
Why?
Equipment?
Then what were we talking to you for?
This the load you lost a while back?
Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd.
I gotta, I gotta go...!
Beg pardon, ma'am?
You're such a doll. I hate money, don't you? God, it's been fun.
What you gonna do back there, East?
Must be some mess back there.
Ain't gonna collect your pay?
Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
You think I'm lying!
That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
There's an E in MONEY. If that's your word.
For money.
Let's see how you look. Fine. You look fine. Now I'm gonna have to have that other ten...
What's in your socks?
Listen, keep away from me, hear? You come near me again, I snatch you bald-headed!
Smart thing for me to do is haul ass outta here.
You don't seem like no fag...
What for?
I drug in a cot, if you want to stay.
I'm impressed. You're a killer.
The two basic items necessary to sustain life are sunshine and coconut milk. That's a known fact. If I can find the goddam hole the milk squirts out.
In Florida, they come smooth, ready to eat. Down there, your only problem is, diet-wise, you gotta lift an arm to wipe warm milk off your chin. Tough, hey?
Well, uh, he dam well know he ain't 'be-loved Aunt Winifred'.
They wrong?
Hey -- whatsa matter?
Hell, don't cry about it!
Thanks, Joe.
What you got me up here for?
I'm going to Florida.
Take it,easy, boy...  Seems to me you're different than a lotta boys that come to me. Most of 'em seem troubled, confused, but I'd say you knew exactly what you want.
But I'll bet you got one thing in common with them other boys. I'll bet you're lonesome.
You really want to do business?
Looks like a cheap hotel.
'Figgers.
Years?
Gotta be here someplace.  Thought I heard a couple of dead Christians singing down there.
Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean...  ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it.
Dad...I'm...
Where you staying, Dad?
How far?
No, I'm not afraid.
Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash--  ...it just seemed like easy money.
How's it feel?
But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself.
You got your stuff?
What?
What?
'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it.
Billy, what's the matter?
Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy.
Know what?
Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.
The blintzes!  "Try the blintzes..."
Peter...
The Department of Public Health...
Excuse me, I'm talking to you.
Its muscles are locked.
Leonard, listen.  I need to see if there's any nerve damage before we carry you back.  Look, I'm trying to help you here...
Is there a switch?
You better tell me what the hell's going on here!
But the power...
It would take a minute or so.  You won't last that long out there.
Which way?
Just inner chambers...
He's out there. I heard him. How can he be? This things...
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
Metaxonycha Godmani.
Great crowd.
Oh, no, you were-
It's me. Can you hear me?
No, Jesus, no.
It's no use! They know we're in here!
It worked before...
Hello.
What?
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
It bit you.
My God.
Excuse me, that's not exactly the kind of information I was after. You see, he's been missing for quite some time now, and...
If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime.
No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you.
Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck--  Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming.
But what?
Pretty rough so far.
Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours.  Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning.  What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain...
Thank you so much.
This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me--  But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so.
Done?
What are you doing on the floor?  It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in.  I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said "I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way."
Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values.
See, isn't this nice?
Work? You mean write? What in the world do you think I'd write?
But mine cost the most so I don't see how it could smudge.
Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating?
It'll only take a second.
You can--you have the "gotta"--
When you first came here, I only loved the writer part of Paul Sheldon. But now I know I love the rest of him too. As much as Misery loves Ian.  I know you don't love me--don't say you do--you're a beautiful, brilliant, famous man of the world; and I'm...not a movie star type. You'll never know the fear of losing someone like you if you're someone like me.
That's very kind of you, but I'll bet it's not altogether true.
You've been out of your room.
Now don't fuss, Paul.
I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer--
The stranger staying at the Inn, is he someone from Misery's past?
Oh, Paul. I'm dying. Does she wind up with Ian or Windthorne? You have to tell me.
I was fooling, silly.  You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne.  Dome Pear-igg-non.
You really think Sheldon's out there?
You don't think he's dead, do you?
I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble.
No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door.
I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now.
Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books?
You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you?
An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me.
I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business--
I like it. Remember how you once said I live my whole life as if I'm in danger of being found out? Well, I believe I've managed to get that guy down on paper.  Don't think I'm completely nuts, but in some way, Annie Wilkes, that whole experience, helped me.
How I usually find you, Nyah.
You're not interested in seeing how it looks.
I said you're beautiful, Nyah.
Won't do, love.  It's not spring.  It's nearly autumn..You're in Oz.  everything's upside down and backwards here.
I don't know what to do about you, Sean. I'm more than a bit muddled.  I need time.
If you look at Hunt's operational history, he invariably favors misdirection and deception. For a start he won't go into Biocyte from the ground where he has to risk confrontation with security.
Beats fighting the flu, I'm here to tell you.
What was the top bid?
What you got there, mate?
Before we kill her or cure her..
She's in the elevator heading toward Ethan.
How're we doin', then?
No.  You just looked as if you did.
Look, it's either you or the rent and I don't mind telling you it's not an easy choice.
What are you doing here?
Under the circumstances I think we would recommend re-setting the senors to respond to a lighter load.  How do you feel about forty kilos, Miss Hall?
I'm missing something here, aside from a 500,000 pound necklace.  Even after I botched the job, I could've walked out of there with the bloody thing.
You're apologizing for me?  Quite the gentleman..
Scotland Yard, Interpol, every Dutch authority.  I can make them go away.
What's you name?
The only other spook I knew was a liar. Charming but absolutely incapable of telling the truth.  He'd lie about his favorite color.  But then I reckon it's an occupational hazard.  All spies really do is conceal the truth and tell lies.
That's not the point.  In the end what spies rely on is the one thing they think they know that you don't.
Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there.
How's it going?  Everything okay?
Just like old times?
Ambrose has photographs of newspapers with loads of money piled on them -- thirty- seven million on the London Times.  What's that about?
I want <i>you out of there.</i>
What?  You told me to get out of here.  I thought you were here to collect me.  I was so relieved.
Well.  You're sorry and I'm sorry.
Like what?
Like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry.  And a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier.  So let's get on with it.  He's still in Sydney?
If he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?
Right now only Ambrose knows that.
'Terrorists?'
Excuse me?
You made it sound as if I was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.
Sorry, Ethan.  I don't quite know where to begin.  Any suggestions?
Why not?  You've done just about everything else on this operation.
No, I don't.  But in this case -
Nekhorvich specialized in recombining DNA molecules.  In the myth, Bellerophon killed Chimera, a recombinant monster with the head of a lion and the tail of a serpent who plagued the ancient world.  I think Nekhorvich has created a monster virus in Chimera and apparently the means to kill it in Bellerophon.
Ambrose just pulled the memory card out of the digital camera and put it into an envelope, put it in his inner left jacket pocket...
Now how to get in there.
Well, the thought had occurred to me.  I needed Chimera in order to peddle Bellerophon.  For hero to be appreciated, you need a monster. Now that's not so difficult to understand, is it?  Look, time was a shot of penicillin could knock off every bloody bug in the zoo!  Not anymore!..have you any idea the R&D money it takes to float one little pissy boutique antibiotic that's barely effective against one strain of one bacterium?  If I couldn't makes money killing the microscopic little shits that are out there, you'd help me put one out there I can make on!..there it is.  I've confessed.  I, John C. McCloy, am in business to make money.  Lilly's making billions feeding Prozac to depressed dogs.  Pfizer doesn't even know where to put the money they're making on Viagra, and let me tell you that shit didn't do a thing for me even at twice the recommended dose, Jesus, who do I have to screw to get a a break!..now get me out of here, get me treated and let's go back to work!..
To friends.
What can we do, Barnes?  Put a guy at the airport?  How many identities do you think Hunt has?  How many times has he slipped past custom, in how many countries?  These guys are trained to be ghosts.  <u>We</u> taught them how to do it, for Christ's sake!
That's S.O.P..
Only four more cars.
Krieger can get it.  Right?
Are <u>you</u> all right Ethan.  What's wrong with you?
You were in the car!
They're dead.  Jim's dead.
What?
Who sent you?!  Who sent you?
What are you going to do?
May I come in?
I didn't say that.
Ethan...Kittridge is on the train.
Go ahead.
No sir.
I can't tell you how sorry I am.  I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan.  Personally as well as professionally.
What?
I don't quite follow you.
If you're dealing with someone who's crushed, stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how devastated do you think you're going to make him by marching Ma and Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?
The official apology from the Justice Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.
The penny drops.  <u>You</u> are <u>not</u> Job.  Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful.  Job is not playful.  So you're something of a paradox.
On what?
And how might you know that?  Are you another Company man?
Mm - Hmmm...
Thanks, Max.  Or is it Maxine?
Ha, dear boy!  I do hope this doesnít prelude a meeting in private.
Simple game.  Four players.  Exfil opens the pocket --  -- cyber ops lifts the wallet.
Merci.
IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!
Give me the God damn gum.
Higher.  Higher.
The package is in the open.
Sarah eye on the package.  Jim, Iím coming to you.
I don't communicate very well through a shroud.
I thought I'd take some now.
I guess.
You're going to use Walter?
- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
Jim, who do you think you're kidding?  A doctor's gotta look at that.  You can't sit up straight.
..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War.  No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself.  Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - <i>without your permission</i>.  The son-of-a- bitch!  How <i>dare</i> he?  You realize itís over, youíre an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, youíve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.  Kittridge, weíll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
Whatís going to make him do that?
- no.  She canít know about me.  No one can.  Not til this is over.  Thereís too much at stake, Ethan.
You got it.
Tell me something Claire, that night in Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all over town?
Jim, itís over.
What's going on?
Thirty-two and change.
How long until we reach the Chunnel?
Whatís the problem.
Who's dead?
You're welcome.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
Where's Ma?
I'm getting married.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
Mona?
You're my father.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
What's wrong can never be made right. 
You are going to marry my brother?
I have no life.
Where'd Johnny find you?
When you get engaged?
Why you talking to me?
Your blood.
It's so bright.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
You don't get along with anybody!
Who painted that?
This is your place.
He's coming.
No, I'll tell him.
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
You don't want the fish.
What's the matter?
Have Something.
Will you marry me?
Yes, on the floor.
What about the wedding?
Have you told her we're getting married?
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Will you live here?
How's the mother?
Did he tell her?
No. But I have a hangover.
What? He's in Sicily!
He's with his dying mother!
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Talk to him.
Moving in?
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
So.
My mother's recovered.
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
Can I get another one of these?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Nerves.
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
That's my house.
I don't know.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
Burn them.
Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
It's not a question of where he grips it,  It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ...  A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
Where does he live?  Old man ... where does he live ...
There is much danger ... for beyond the cave lies the Gorge of Eternal Peril which no man has ever crossed.
King of the WHO?
Order, eh -- who does he think he is?
Well, how did you become king, then?
All right!  What do you want?
What is that?
We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
You are indeed brave Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
You stupid bastard.  You havn't got any arms left.
I'll do you for that.
All right, we'll call it a draw.
Well, what are you then?
Who are you who are so wise in the ways of science?
And that, my lord, is how we know the Earth to be banana-shaped.
Who ... Who breaks out?
Who are you? TALL KNIGHT We are the Knights Who Say "Ni"!
What with?
What?
We shall attack at once.
Who are they?
By what name are you known?
Greetings Tim the Enchanter!
... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.
Ha ha ha.  Ha ha ha.
Old woman!
Man.  I'm sorry.  Old man, What knight live in that castle over there?
What I object to is that you automatically treat me like an inferior ...
... But all the decision of that officer ...
... but a two-thirds majority ...
Ah! NOW ... we see the violence inherent in the system.
I'm averting my eyes, Lord.
Exactly.  So... logically ...
What is your name?
My name is Sir Robin of Camelot!
To seek the Grail!
Oh, well ... er brave Concorde!  You shall not have been fatally wounded in vain!
Really, I feel fine, sir.
Gosh - Is he all right?
'Mm ... very nice castle, Camelot ... very good pig country....
No!  Not the curtains, lad ...  All that ...  all that you can see, stretched out over the hills and valleys ... as far as the eye can see and beyond ... that'll be your kingdom, lad.
But, Father.
How?
No ...  You stay in the room and make sure he doesn't leave.
Oh, I remember ... can he ... er ... can he leave the room with us?
And make sure he doesn't leave.
Yes ...  make sure ...
The Castle Anthrax?
Camelot ...
Quick!
Come Sir Galahad, quickly!
We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.
Look, it's my duty as a knight to try and sample as much peril as I can.
Oh, fair one, behold your humble servant, Sir Launcelot, from the Court of Camelot.  I have come to take you ...  away ... I'm terribly sorry ...
Well ... yes ... but I hadn't realised ...
Bravely ran away, away.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Prince Leopold?  Is he the one who bleeds all day?  So what does his valet do?  Wash his poultices for him?
It's only grief makes her like she is.
What?
Which one of us is she flirting with?
You've got three broken ribs, man!
And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
What's your name?
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Hey, Barney.
Yeah, there's a good girl.  Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it.
Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops.
If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father --
Mama...
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it.  The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever.  As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five.  No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.  You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
What do you know about the Highlands?
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone.
You sent for me.
You're injured.
Still, someone must attend you.  Your wife should not have let you out.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
They're ready now.
What is it, John?  John?
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Ma'am?
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...!  All I've ever thought about is you!
Forgive me, gentlemen.  I'm late.
We're going to lose.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help.  Where is the old girl?
Quite.  I think I'd best take it back.
Where did you find it by the way?
Well, no rest for the wicked, Henry.
We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am.
I'm sorry, ma'am?
Excellent, ma'am, excellent.  But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest--
Unwell?
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Who told them that?
Why not?
Ma'am?
Where is my son?
Then why are you not with him?
Could you play ARCADE with that?
Level Ten.  That's where you've got to unlock ARCADE's heart using the keys you've found.
Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it.
What do you mean by "weird"?
This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what?
Where do we go?
It's not just the cable system.  It's in the phone system as well, the electronic net.  It's everywhere.
It's growing.  Getting stronger. Maybe it's only localized now...
What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive.
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is that?!
One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware.
So start at the beginning...
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
So what's the problem?
Now... did you answer cause you thought that's what I wanted to hear or did you think about what I said and answer cause you truly believe that to be right?
Yes...what is it?
Unbelievable. Look... here.  I don't know what's going on. That's so much baloney. I've got enough cash for one night, okay?
Wow!
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
No, no, I'm fine.
Can you tell me what happened?
I think I've been hurt.
No.
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke. 
Don't stop!
Those men in front, in the car.
No... but...
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
To my audition.
Wally Brown.
No, we don't.
Yes, Sir.
You're so easy.
Why did you want to go to breakfast if you're not hungry?
To Denny's? I wasn't going to say anything, but why Denny's?
You see what I mean...
Well he said...  you know in his way... you know what I mean? Besides the guy gettin' rolled up under the kids car which busted him up pretty bad, there was this little knife-like torn piece of metal, you know, off the car body, rolled out and slid up through this guy's neck and just kinda slit his aorta, you know, but they didn't find it right away, so the guy's losin' a lot of blood, you know, to the brain - all this time cause it was just like this thin little puncture wound on the surface of his neck that kinda sealed itself, he said, while inside the aorta is bleedin' pretty steady all that time. So, Dr. Scott's laughin' you know like he does 'cause he knows we want to talk to this guy. He's laughin' you know and shakin'... Son of a bitch couldn't stop laughin'... It was kinda contagious 'cause pretty soon we were all laughin'...the nurse was laughin'. You know how he is.
Yeah ... and they both use the same address.
Palmdale.
Well, not much Ed. Just doin' some stuff for this guy.
Hardly.
Not here...no thanks.
So many tubes to get in, only one is the way out.
You have 43 unpaid parking tickets, sir. You have the right to remain silent, anything you say can & will be held.....
Where are we ?
What about Matt ?
McCay knows ?
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
It was there, clear as day. I saw the computer records. Matthew has been fed wiring money to his personal account.  I just knew something was wrong.
There are other things too. They had everyone start taking those psych tests. Did they make you take one ?
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
I don't get it.
Just stop it. End it here.
What are you DOING here ?
Kojak here is arresting me for unpaid parking tickets.
Hey buddy, thanks for the help back there !
I didn't think he'd make it past Scraps.
It's my control board and I don't want it acting squirrelly because you dropped a few crumbs into the keyboard, no put the shit away.
Johnny, let's get the cleanup started.
Hand me the 3/8ths.
When you are ready.
You did.
Yeah, maybe.... Let's start the background checks. Let's see where they live and what kind of security systems....
A real criminal.... I still think that's our in... What about her ?
Zachory ! My boy, how goes the carnage down on 44 ?
Zach, how old are you, son ?
That mail room kid was the longest lasting "guest" yet ! Maybe we can alter the computer records and make another "guest" from the more athletic of our staff.
I'm willing to bet that even the creator can't out wit his creation.
Do you think the assistant, what's his name...
Yes sir. It will be the best of your collection, I assure you.
I thought, and correct me if I'm wrong, but weren't you trying to play both sides ?
No. I am not a homosexual.
Bruce has just awaken.
What is Bruce doing ?
What's next ?
There ! There ! Did you see ! They're still alive !
I don't know. I think that a power grid just needs reset. Don't get your panties in a bunch. I'll go down and reset it.
Good golly miss molly you are looking good today !
Really ? On a date ?
Are you okay ?
The roof is coming down.... hey, you.... Which door gets us out of here ??
You don't have to sound so emphatic.
Are you okay ? Any holes ? I mean aside from the one's that nature gave you ?
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
This is California, anything is possible.
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
Okay, no problem.
So, what's on your mind?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Seriously.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
I don't know if I want to.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every  palm tree.
Maybe he's wet?
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
And she saved it.
Do you have any pictures if her?
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Hi.
That's okay.
My mother can't have any more kids.
Hi.
You're crazy, what was her big achievement? Did she invent gravity?
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
If it's in here at all, it's in the back two rows.
Getting off please.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
I think it's cool.
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
Does it work?
Uh oh...
...I dropped it.
Where are you going???
Hey look!
Right.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
No?
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
I don't think the color of the interior is....
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
But...are you engaged or something?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Committed?
A secret, I like that.
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
I think this place is just fine.
Bye Aunt Rose.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
Something wrong?
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Did it hurt a lot?
Let me hold him.
Arthur!!
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Wanna play?
What am I doing here????? What am I doing here?
Ex...ex, ex...
It's there.
Excuse me, what about the job?
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
Well, you were pretty great!
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Of course not.
Dad??
Are they ready yet?
What are you doing.
Why not?
Did I kill my mother?
Harry, I'm serious, trust me Harry this woman's lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and Harry.
Oh she's picking you up, good you're on the right track.
Hi.
Sure.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
Really?
Is that your camper?
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
He won't give it to me.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
No.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
I'm hemorrhaging.
Oh great!
If I do it, can we go?
Your lip bleeding?
Hmmmm, interesting.
Do you remember her?
Heaven.
Sorry.
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Pacifist!
Bed wetter!
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Can we go yet?
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
I dunno..
Have you ever kissed anyone?
Like this?
Close your eyes.
Say something it's too quiet.
Yeah, it's in the contract.
You don't miss much.
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
I've lost interest.
We'll never be the same.
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
Chill.  We don't want your face coming off with it.
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
Zit cream?
Neosporin?
I give.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
I suppose it's too late to start over.
Two words.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
Excuse me?
What else did he tell you...
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
I've been calling for days!
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
She's too genuine.
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
Where was that, Florence, huh?
Should I whistle down a cab?
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah?  Sure.  The rhinos were fucking.
No problem.  A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days.  About us, actually.
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
Takes me back.
I'm up against a deadline.
I forgot how cute you look.  When you get impossible.
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
I'm just tired.  Please put her on?  Thanks.
She denied it.  Said I was crazy and paranoid.
What's up?
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
Lower.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
And to m...
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
You got the money?
Well, don't lose it. Last time I gave you twenty-five dollars, you lost it.
You lost twenty-five dollars once before that, too, near Christmas time -- I remember that real well now. December 9th, to be exact.
What?
Winifred, the kids want you home and so do I.
You're from out of town?
Barnett?
Don't worry, I'll take care or it
Am I disturbing you?
I said, I've been real tired.
It's fine. We were just talking about Vitamin S.
I'll tell Ester, she'll be thrilled I saw you again.
You bet.
Yes.
Well, that's not entirely true, Barnett. At least not according to Haven.
I guess that's why he thought you right want to help out.
What?
I got trapped and you know it, so let's have some rules.
No, you don't, so don't say you do. Bunch of damn liars. What do you get out or this?
He's lining up talent for Hal Phillip Walker.
He has that sign with the tree.
It's on National television, Barnett.
You want anything?  A drink?
D.C.?  Tammany Hall?  He came there?
Okay.
President?
Oh... Well... Have you heard from Barnett?
He's my father.
Business School so I can run Haven's business.
What?
My wife and I think so, but we're family. Your family's always good or bad depending on how you look at your family. What do you do, pick or sing?
Listen, do you know anything about cars?
What's this?
Who's that?
Listen, your Aunt Ester just died. I'm... sorry... Listen, I really Feel bad now about last night...We had no...
Hey, there - You seen my Winifred?
What kind?
I feel really good.
Fungus?
Listen. Maybe I should go...
When did you start singing?
Are you a close friend of Haven's?
Do you like him?
I don't know who you are.
What?
You're really terrific, you know what I mean --LINNEA rolls over and faces him.
I'm twenty-eight
I was in prison for twenty-eight years.
Premeditated murder.
Sleep. That's all I need. Don't want to waste no time sleeping. You married?
You know who that is?
They said go see the chaplain.
What time?
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
That's for sure. At the airport - that's where it was. At the airport, there in one of those gift shops... Anyway, you better take a break.
What National TV...?
I mean...
We just got a gold record.
Probably a little too long.
Pleasure
Oh --
Peter Finch -- he's English.
Oh, you meet them at parties and stuff.
Well -- maybe. Let's see what happens here.
You think it will?
More or less.
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
Well, now me and Mickey are gonna take it easy. Just enjoy each other's company, stop and smell the roses, notice the color purple, stuff like that.
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
Who's the song bird?
Yeah. Ya see, I ordered that special.
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
Sorry about that.
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Tell me about the purity.
Describe Mallory.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
I can't run with you, Mickey! I really want to. If I could, I would, but I can't. I gotta stay here. But you can still get out of here.
If they stay, they'll catch you, and they don't have to catch you---
Yes.
And they made the first move?
Yes.
They're shocking the world into remembering the primal law.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Nothing for me. I'm leavin'.
How's it working, Scotty?
It's gonna be beautiful.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
It sure is.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
They done that too long in my family.
Where' you goin'?
Boy - you hear me?!
'You Duff Anderson?
Want to keep your job, boy?
I know.
Walker and Williams.
And his age?
It's just that we're not used to seein' anyone stand up 'round here. Kinda took us by surprise.
You working?
My father's the preacher.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
They must work on the section gang.
How come you stay 'round here?
What d'you mean?
Surprised?
Hi.
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
What about him?
My kids want me to teach them.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
Don't look so scared.
Ain't that something?!  That's just fine, baby.
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
Don't deny me, Duff.
Hi.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
Day work.
You heard me!
Like hell they can't.  They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
Where're you going to go?
A whole lot, Frankie.
Like a home, for one thing.
That's right.
Jesus, I told you to watch it!
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.
What did you say, boy?!
How often does he get like that?
Come on, Pop.
Going back, huh?
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
Sure. Got a sixteen-year-old girl.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
No. Why?
Let's stay here, Will.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
He's your son.
Let's go.
I fucking hate Raoul.  Shut the fuck up, asshole! someone.
I'm sorry, Danny. Time's up. I'11 do the girl, then me. I don't give a fuck.
How long's it been?
Oh my God, I'm terribly sorry. Did I hurt you?
They're a bit too real for my taste. Will you excuse me for a moment?
Take this off.
What about her?
What are you doing in here?
What you lookin' for, mon?
We did a pretty good job of pissing them off.
The Villa Straylight. Home of the Royal Family and the mainframe of the computer entity we know as Wintermute. If we can get Molly in, she can access the mainframe to cripple Mute's defences, the Case can destroy it in Cyberspace.
Your gun, your prints. The Tessiers might overlook a little child molesting, but murder's bad P.R., Mr. Riviera. I suggest to reconsider my offer.
Our analysis of the London stock crash suggest that it was manipulated from within the international computer matrix. Cyberspace, Mr. Case... A realm I believe you're familiar with.
Then I'd ask you what your terms are.
Who's running the show, Armitage? This a government sting?
Why'd you do it, Armitage?
First sign of free will, Sense/Net usually slags 'em.
Anything rated higher than a P.C.'s got a hard-wired suicide switch. It'll self- destruct.
Right. Best cowboy that ever punched deck. The old man taught me most of what I know.
That's gonna be tough because Dixie McCoy's dead. The A.I. flatlined him.
Working with a dead man. Shit, I've done about everything else.
Fried Air Tram in the process. Not to mention half my gear.
Really? Do I get to know where I'm going? It makes packing so much easier.
That could work, but the timing will be a bitch.
You've got your orders.
Tell me the words.
I saw your girl yesterday.
Ya learned good. So, what's happening?
Nothin'. Not a goddamn thing. What the fuck...
Sure, Kid. It's a firmware construct.
So be it, we cross into Babylon like a cool breeze.
Four men. Babylon soldiers.
I duped these prints off him. Can you run an I.D.?
What?
Bright enough to be dangerous.
It's possible. The guy was a blank slate.
Could be suicidal. It's not easy to kill yourself with all those hard wired defence programs.
What are you talkin' about?
Meet me back here in twenty-five. We'll kick this open if we can. But, Case... you need that access code or you'll just fry inside.
Want to fucking answer them?
Why did you come here tonight, Linda?
Where did you here that?
Case... are you okay?
You know why Linda's dead. She loved you and you let her down. It's that simple. Of course I did instigate certain events. Calculated the variables. I found her to be... expendable.
Excellent. That's exactly what I had in mind. But if you're going to kill me, we have to work together, old son. I'm no pushover, you know.
Because you've exceeded your shelf life, Case. Word on the street is you're a dead man walking. Nice time for an employment opportunity. Travel to exotic locales.
What about before that?
Sure. I finally pulled a run on my old man's credit file when I was seventeen... only it was too late for him.
It sounds like you.
Case... Are you alright?
Le Vingtieme Siecle. We're meeting Armitage there for the midnight floor show.
When they did my eyes, I made them promise I'd still be able to cry. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
Remember, that poet that we liked – the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
No Roger from op/ed?
Forget it.
Senorita Josie.
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
You need my help?
Wow. It's packed.
Wings?
Hey Josie. It's Josie, right?
I think it's pronounced gauche.
Hey Josie- who did Archie date Betty or Veronica?
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
How many times have I fired her?
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Gus?
That's your story!
Oh my god.
Rufus.  But I don't even know where you live.
You know what, though? I feel like I'm really ready to do it. To have sex for the first time.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
You're twenty-three years old!
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
I love the way she writes.
So what are you thinking for college?
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
Are you--scared?
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
No, I'm alone.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?!  I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
I don't know.
Aloha! Welcome!
Rob, what do you want to be when you grow up?
Wow - I-
He <u>has</u> to know...
He sure is big, Jack...
Where're we taking him?
Uh-huh.
<i>                      This is a thing called a present. The whole thing starts with a box...</i>
<i>                      That's the point of the thing, not to know!</i>
<i>                      I say that we take a cannon Aim it at his door and then Knock three times and when he answers Sandy Claws will be no more.</i>
You got your room straightened out yet?
I told you I want that room unpacked.
You set this all up, didn't you?  One of your sick jokes?
So, what about you and that Poletti girl?
You two got a thing going, or what?
She giving you any carfare for the ride?
Elm Street?  You telling me you moved in to that big white house with the bars on the windows?
Shit, you can tell your old man he's a real chump.
You hit that ball pretty good, Walsh.
Schneider shouldn't have called you out on that double.
Oh Jesus.  I'm gonna be sick.
Aren't you afraid somebody could steal your car like that?
You shouldn't be fighting with that jerk.
You mean a shithead.
"Rod's been killed - he got Rod. Just Glen and me now.  Can't fall asleep!"
What about "essential energy" the soul.  Does that go into the air too?  You think there's a good energy and a bab energy?
Here.
You want to talk about it?
I think I better go.  I'm just not into it tonight.  I'm sorry.
You created him - you can destroy him. He lives off your fear.  Fight him, Jesse!
I'm not taking drugs, Dad.  Can I go to bed now?
Morning.
I got your invitation yesterday. Thanks.  Any cute guys gonna be there?
You're going out?
Are you crazy?  You'll wake the whole neighborhood!
Well, I'm home now, so you can go right to sleep.  C'mon, angel.
Menthol, regular, ultra-light.
I can see that. You watch too damn much TV.
Horseshit.
Have you ever done that before?  Pulled someone into your dream?
You like gymnastics?
I haven't been able to do that since I was a little girl.
What are these, beauty marks?
Now who's gonna take the word of a crazy junkie chick like you?
Only if you call me Neil.  What was that nursery rhyme all about?
My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
It was.  Neil, do you believe in other realities?
What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
All right.  Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
We can try again.
Take it slowly.  Remember, this is a dream. Anything is possible.
I've heard crazier things this week.
Neil, it's no use.  You saw how he is.
Who is he?
My God.
You said something before...about laying him to rest...?
If he continues having these outbursts, I'll have to have him isolated permanently.
She's been doing ground-breaking research on pattern nightmares.
That's enough, Kincaid.
I'm sorry, Neil.  You brought this on yourself.
Okay, you're attacked by the Bog Demon. Go ahead.
Hi.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
What do you think of the guinea fowl?
No!
And then I... right.
Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
Right.  Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
Are you busy tonight?
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
If that's all right.
Floppy, huh?
So who left who?
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
Why?
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
I have thought about you.
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
'Certainly.  And little Johnny?'
Yup.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
What?
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
This is certainly... ah...
I thought I'd give it to you.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Excuse me.
No.  Not true...
I mean I loved you -- you were terribly funny.  But all that kissing my ears...
Good decision.  All actresses are mad as snakes.
Is this your first film?
Da Vinci?
Yes.  What do you think?
I was called and I came.  What's up?
The phone number of Anna Scott's agent in London and her agent in New York. You can ring her.  You think about her all the time -- now you can ring her!
What do you think?  Good move?
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
I'll see what I can do.
Absolutely.  Ice cold still water.
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
I agree.
Pleased to meet you.  Did you like the film?
That's right -- Topol.
Martin -- your customer.
But it's not for the shop.  It's for you.
Excuse me -- it's your mother on the phone.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
Well?
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation.  I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
Right.  No one else?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
Spike.  For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this.
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife...  Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
And yet you suspect her.
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
P-p-p-please du-du-du-don't t-t tell her, p-p-please...
Sh-sh-she did! Everybody did!
Well, say, how 'bout easin' it down a bit so a man don't have to shout!
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
On this ward?
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast...  You too, Mister McMurphy.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
I'm not finished yet.
You men remain seated!
Yes, Miss Ratched?
What's your name, buddy?
No, kid, it was my own stupidity, that's what pissed me off.
Hey, Billy. Billy boy, wake up and say goodbye to your ol' buddy.
I-I-I'm w-w-wet...
In ya go...
Sock it to 'em, kid!
In there.
Wait a minute...
Go with him, Rose. Go with him.
What for?
There they are!
It's the questions she asks.
Yeah, my feet are cold...
Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party?
Lobotomy!
Is that your sense of humor or are you tryin' to say somethin'?
Okay, sucker.
Ya deaf! I said pass the ball!
Don't you have any clubs?
Why not?
Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
Hear what?
Who told you that?
You need four houses on every lot of the same color, Martini. Now let's go, for Christsakes.
Psst! Hey, Martini, wake up!
Oh, what's that?
Poker!
How are you feeling?
Yes, well, Miss Ratched feels that you're a disturbing influence on the other patients.
Shhh. Hold it down! I'll take you guys down, but ya gotta come right back up! 'Kay?
'Kay, let's see...  Cheswick first ... then Billy... Martini... Scanlon... Sefelt... Fredrickson... Taber an' the Chief... 'Kay
What's troubling ya, buddy?
You look pretty healthy to me.
You think it's funny, huh?
Put your money where your mouth is, Taber.
Yeah, we'll miss breakfast!
Got a cigarette?
You just come on with that three fifty and Martini will take care of himself... Your dice, Scanlon.
A dime.
Well, you boys finish it up an' climb back into your beds. 'Kay?
I'll be very glad to show you around, Miss...
Please follow me.
You comin' in to hold my hand?
Sure, I know Chuck. I know him.
Yeah, how much you wanna bet?
Maybe I'll just use that thick skull of yours as a batterin' ram, Sefelt.
I thought I might donate it to the mess hall.
Yes, sir, it's a mighty nice fall day...
Of course.  Mister McMurphy.
How 'bout twenty?
The lights were flashing on and off, Mister Turkle.
You've been drinking on the job again, haven't you, Mister Turkle!
They're sleeping, Miss. They're sleeping. An' we gotta keep it down so we don't disturb their sleep.
Oh, I see. He was a very sick man. Very sick.
You better believe it, you sweet little thing. You better believe it...
She was your sister.
May I see your boarding pass, please?
Excuse me?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
So, what's the story with your friend?
No, really.  What's she doing?
Is he some kind of celebrity or something?
Oh, right.  Dwayne.  You're engaged to Dwayne?
Let's face it.  Sooner or later we all die.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Hello?  Is anybody there?
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
You're limping.
Are you okay?  You want some help?
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
Why are you asking me this?
Why not?
Why?
Mickey Spillane.
Where are you going?  Just-- out of curiosity...
Nice dress.
So were you.
No.  Are you're leaving?
Yes.  I am.
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
And this is the thanks I get.  I did you a favor.  You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real.  Granted, ideally, me.  I didn't do it to hurt you.  I did it for you.  I did it for us...
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
I don't believe in statistics.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
Come on, it's not so bad.
It's a miracle.
It's still the new year...
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
You okay?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
A phone message.  Only--
Your brother?
What's that supposed to mean?...
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
Why?
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
Amazing...
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
You are looking for a place to stay, no, Kate?
How old are you?
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
If you kept your ears wide open instead of your mouth—
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
You said they was only going to talk to him.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
Mm—hmm.
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
—ex-tanker who's walking on his heels— ?
Wow... .
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
See! You don't understand!
It was you, Charley... .
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
I think we're O.K.
I want to be a teacher.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Likewise. And draw two for chasers.  Now you're beginning to live.
Were you really a prize fighter?
Terry!
Why, Terry, who said it was?
His— racket?
Edie— I— I— never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you— you're... .
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
Edie...
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
Terry, no, no... .
Every one of 'em... .
Then go ahead— go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a—  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
I'm not trying to tell you he's Little Lord Fauntleroy.
Six-toed cats. Assyrians. Abyssinians. It's the same difference. Well don't think this Terry Malloy is any six-toed cockeyed Assyrian. He's a bum. Charley and Johnny Friendly owned him when he was a fighter and when they ring the bell he still goes into action.
You think we kept you out in Tarrytown just to have you go walkin' with a corner saloon hoodlum like Terry Malloy? Now get back to Tarrytown, before I put a strap to you.
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
But you're the one I want to tell— what you said over Nolan— about keepin' silent when you know the score— I'm guilty— you hear me? I'm guilty... .
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
Conscience... .  I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
This is my business.
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
Who asked him here?
You all right, Nolan?
You still call it ratting?
What do you think?
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
So help me God!
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
I think you could have.
I ought to belt you one, J.P.
Better.
A cheese-eater!  You're kidding!
You ought to go home and take care of that—
Hey, Skins—  --get away with that sheet metal all right?
I— I was just on my way up, Johnny.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
She's off limits for bums like you. Leave her alone.
Yeah, yeah— Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
Listen— Nolan—
Leave her alone, you fiend!
If I could get my hands on you...
But does it have to be in a cemetery?
I'm getting the jitters! Let's turn back!
Not dead?  In a cemetery?
What do you mean?
What can we do?
The ropes are coming loose.
My guess is if we don't take the chance pretty soon, we're not going to have much life left anyway.
They wouldn't dare put us in the same grave-- <b>or would they?</b>
All right.  Put it on heavy.
...And what is this?
Oh, yes, a religion of sorts.
The moon is almost gone!
Your pleasures of course!
You may take her now.
It's not often an Emperor like <i>you</i> calls on creatures like us.
I could make her another Cleopatra...
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
I want to speak with you, please.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
You didn't visit him in prison.
But you spoke to him on the phone.
Ask him his name.
I'm not dressed.
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Do we need him?
I know exactly what you mean.  It's just a feeling.  You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Is that Snoopy?  In the purple doo rag?
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you?  'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead.  Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing.  I say let fate decide.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
And she saw you?
You find out?
I'll make you a deal.  Get out of here. Right now.  I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
They look like plain old rocks.
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
We made it, didn't we?
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
You talked to him?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks.  You recall that?
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you.  So you had to at least suspect him.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
Leave it where it is.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Who?
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together.  You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
This doesn't concern you, Foley.  Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
There isn't any.  All this shit you got in here.  What is all this stuff anyway?  Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
Where's your gun, your pistol?
Guys like me, huh.  Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you.  I've never done that in my life.
You don't act like it.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde?  Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat?  You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
That part in the movie where they get shot?  Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
Unless you wanna tell me.
Don't leave me.
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
I hear he didn't mean to.  The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
You're not dumb.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
Take your sunglasses off.
Wait in the car.
Looks like tonight.
Tell me something.  What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
I know what you're talking about.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do <u>you</u> believe Glenn?
Have they got Midge up there?
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her.  She told him I was down in Florida.
You busted out?
There were others.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
I'll send it to you at Glades.
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me.  I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
You there?
Watch the road, boy.  I like this Town Car.  We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
Wait a minute.  I'm letting <i>you</i> in on this, not all your friends.
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
I can tell.
Here?  In this house?
Well, <i>he</i> ain't even here that much.  I like to know where he goes, but at the same time I don't <i>want</i> to know, you understand?
Technically.  They're separated.
Can we change the subject?
He doesn't even look like that.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone.  Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon.  Tell her you think he's a nice guy.  No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it.  If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her?  I bet nothing.  So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out.  You think that's possible?  What kind of guy is he?
You gonna go get him?
You here all by yourself?
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street.  But then, I could be wrong...
Excuse me.  Snoopy?  Did we settle the fish thing?
Now listen, it's hands off Billy.  I mean, you can put your hands on him if you want to, but then my hands will break yours.
I wish she could forget him.
Nervous?
You'll love it.  No base, no bars, just lots of sun and aircraft maintenance.
What lizard?
Shit, he's puking on my feet!
Danny, I don't like this fuckin' guy.
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Good shooting, Danny!
How could you do this?
Don't make this a joke, Rafe.  You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Then why are you looking for her?
Yeah, right.  Anyway, you didn't know.
I'm saying now you do know.  So it's time for you to fuck off.
Don't blame her, Rafe.  It's not like you're thinking.
They're all over us!
I got a half a tank.  You?
Fun today.  Like old times.
What do you mean?  I'm just doing what we've always done.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
Hey!  What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
I taught him to drink beer.  He taught me how to fly.
That might not have been such a good idea.  They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield.  The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
That's bullshit, son.  But it's really good bullshit.
In flight school you qualified in single and in multi-engine planes.  You'll be flying multi-engines here.
How often you fight like this?
There's one thing I have to say.  I'm going away.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
Set up teams of radio operators to send out messages the Americans will intercept, concerning every potential American target in the Pacific.  Include Hawaii -- the clutter will be more confusing that way.
We have achieved surprise, but their carriers are not in port.  I don't like this.
We have bombed Tokyo, Mr. President. Radio Tokyo interrupted it's own broadcast to make the announcement.
Hello, Lilla!
Quite a bit more rain than usual this year. I hope it doesn't spoil the rhubarb.
Let's go.
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Do you have to wear that hat?
Mom, lots of people are separated and divorced.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
I don't get it.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
What's the matter?
We're here on the sofa bed...
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out.  And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Right. I promised my mother.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
God, Peggy, you're so unformed you're practically fetal. You're just taking pity on him 'cause he has no friends.
Are you for real?
Terry! Slow down.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
You know, Peggy Sue, your mother said you had a dream that I died.
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Don't get your hopes up.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
You think so?
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
Thank God for that.
All right. But this better be good.
Hi, Dad.
Quiet today?
Yes.
He'll win.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
When did you start drinking coffee?
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Sort of.
Who was that man?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
And the butter.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
You think this'll cheer Dad up?
I remember when you got that locket, too. You were so excited I think you showed it to the whole school.
I spend three hours a day practicing. I have trainers, I know what I'm doing.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four—eyed worm.
What a great kite.
Okay. I promise.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
I was building a doggy door.
I'm real excited about working for you Mr. Matthews...
I hope he doesn't have rabies.
You nervous? New town, new school. I know it must be pretty hard for you...
So where're we going?
What's his name?
I swear, sometimes I wish Gus was dead...
Drew, I know your dog died, but... get a grip, man, you're freaking me out.
It's getting pretty late. We better go.
How can he not have a heartbeat?
Do you really think so, Andy?
Aren't you giving an exam?
Don't apologize for me.
Jerk... What did you say?
You got that right, Mikey...  You still believe that, don't you?
Fuck you.
ALLRIGHT IT'S CLOSED!  Jesus!
You don't think there's much time left, do you?
I'm not going to die.
Whatever.
I know that, Charles.
You can save it for the jury, Charles. I want to hear you say, under oath, in front of a judge and a jury, I'm a bad lawyer.  Gentlemen.  Counselor.
Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal.
Mr. Beckett, I'm sorry...
... meanwhile, I'd like to prepare you for a colonoscopy, so we can take a look inside.
Innocuous?
Whoa-oh!  Sorry, I...
I buy that.
The law says people with disabilities cannot be terminated, so long as they can perform the duties required by their position...
Who'd you get?
Rayisha.
How did they find out?
I've considered that.
A regular all-American guy?
Can you explain <u>why</u> you didn't?
What makes you an excellent lawyer?
What do you love about it?
What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean?
Thanks for coming by.
I thought I was supposed to be covering for you.  God, Andy, you look awful.
Do you take risks?
But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
Some do. I didn't.
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
What's Dr. Gillman say?
Mom?
He was losing weight. He looked kind of tired sometimes. But he was working so hard... Still, I felt something was wrong.  And I can't believe <u>they're</u> saying they didn't notice anything.
Ms. Burton. You're black.
In what way?
And, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.
Objection!
You had contact with someone who has AIDS, and you're worried.
The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
Great.
You have a problem with gays, Joe.
Lots.
Don't know, Joe.
Joe?
Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
Yeah. Do I have a case?
Anywhere from two weeks, to several months.
Yeah. But we took care of him.
You taught him a lesson.
Attorney for the plaintiff?
Let's continue.
Andy. It seems that something has come over you, lately: A kind of... stupor, a fogginess, a lack of focus... Earth to Andy. Anybody home?
That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business.
... But we shouldn't have fired him...
Oh, Lord....
I didn't want you to leave me there... back at the ship...that's why I didn't say anything....
All you people are so scared of me -- an' most days, I'd take that as a compliment -- but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.
Power cells.
Strange, not doin' a run-up on the main drive yet.  Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.
Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren't we still following them?
Back to the ship, huh?
What, you're afraid?
Let's move.  Just a detour. He'll get us there.
You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
Nobody else is going down but me, okay?
Little ratty-ass.
...need those cells from the crash ship. Shit, still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings --
Okay, maybe that's a <u>good</u> thing. Maybe I can use him to help with --
Dancin' on razor blades here...
You're not a real cop, are you? Just some mercenary who goes around talkin' about the law like --
Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
Smoke screen for what?
How much you weigh, Johns?
He'll lead you over the first cliff. You know that, don't you?
This does not help us, Johns.
Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall but while it's cooler.
1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute, shit, we're hemorrhaging air. <u>Somethin'</u> took a swipe at us.
Look, Fry. Company says we're responsible for every one of those --
Oh, no. No, no, no....
Well...we must keep her close, then. Here, she'll be safe if we put her between --
Where's Mr. Johns?
King Tut's tomb....
Very big beads.
Want you to remember this moment, Riddick. The way it coulda gone and didn't.
Here's the deal. You work without the chains, without the bit -- without the shivs. You help us get off this rock....
Think about that reward, Johns.
Well, what's it look like now?
What're you jaw-jackin' about? Girl's not cut.
Look, it's hellified stuff -- but no different than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and who dies. It's called "triage," okay?
Either way, figure it's something you can grab onto.
What's her name, anyway?
Dr. Zaius --
Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my notes.
Well, Taylor -- we're all fugitives now.
As you wish.
They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides...  ... his culture is our culture.
That's Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you about.
The blood transfusion.
'Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened to Landon?'  I don't know.
You didn't think so then.
Geiger counter?
Which direction?
But the quota system's been abolished! You made it. Why can't I?
Hmph.
Objection. The accused is indeed a man. Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.
Of course he doesn't know our culture - because he cannot think.  Tell us why all apes are created equal.
Awww, it still hurts, doesn't it?
Get me a collar and leash. I'm taking him to the infirmary.
It's no use ... there she goes.
Gone.
Air leak. Died in her sleep.
Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for a man who's two thousand and thirty one years old.  I read the clocks. They bear out Hasslein's hypothesis. We've been away from Earth for two thousand years, give or take a decade.  Still can't accept it, huh?
Because time has wiped out everyone and everything you cared for -- they're dust.
Straighten me out on something. Why did you come along at all? You volunteered. Why?  I'll tell you. They nominated you for the Big One and you couldn't turn it down. Not without losing your All-American standing
Scarecrows?
Can we take a dip?
We got off at the wrong stop.
All right, all right. Will You do me a favor? No orders.
Lucius.
That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
Gorilla hunters ...
Yes, Sir. But this -- creature is a special case.
You asked for the opportunity to present your case. Surely you must know why you're here.
It says here that his name is Bright Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.
You destroyed his memory! His mind! His identity! And, you want to do the same to me!
Let it be clear at the outset that all matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the Tribunal.  You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.
ThatÕs a lie!
What about me?
No.
Of course.
Stop right there.
There is no contradiction between faith and science. True science.
It's humiliating.
Would you like to come along?
Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
Go with God, Taylor.  That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
Do you believe him?
...but 'Lias is still out there.
I SHIT on all o' you.
Blood trail just keeps going and going but no body.
Sarge?
Uh... Bob. Like to speak to you. Take a minute.
Hey Big Harold, gimme your peaches for the fruitcake man.
You gonna wipe your ass dis time?
Don babytalk him man. Cocksucker fell asleep. They walked right up on us, he don do shit.
Y'ever look at yoself in the mirror Junior, youse uglier than a dick on a dog man. 
Shit, I bet I been laid more'n you have.
Come on you can do better than that!
Taylor - get your ass over here. Move!
Yeah! I got two of them fuckers...
Taylor! Francis!
...beautiful night.
Barnes got it in for you, don't he?
And you, do you believe?
Okay - got light duty, three days.
So what am I going to do! Get one of my guys zapped so some fuckface fresh from the World can get his beauty fucking sleep!
The Good Lord works his revenge in strange ways.
Then you jes gonna forget 'bout Elias and all the good times we done had? Right in here.
Tennessee someplace. Hill country.
I was home on leave y'know and everybody's just worried 'bout making money, everybody's out for themselves, they don't even want to talk about it man, it's like the fucking Twilight Zone back there - you wouldn't even KNOW there's a war on here. My sister says to me why you have to go there like I started this...
Hey Lieutenant I didn't ask for this job, I...
Or Reno?  They always throw them off the bridge there, I've heard.
I'll make one for you.  I live there.
A very small service. It doesn't even ask for thanks. How long for?
Suppose I hadn't known that immigration inspector? Hadn't put in a good word for you?
What's the matter?
We have some nice places around Vancouver.
Well, how about a breeze up to the penthouse about six o'clock?  A friend of mine is throwing a cocktail party up there.
Nobody gets invited to Clark Brandon's parties. They just go.
Don't I even get my face slapped?
What's the matter, baby? Don't you like being kissed?
Well... they have to service the plane... and get a pilot down to the field, unless there's one hanging around there still... and then they have to get the immigration officer...
They might think I was running away from something.
A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
There isn't one.. That anyone would believe. I went for a walk after dinner, down to the ocean...alone... I came up and went to bed. I didn't sleep very well. Then there was a thunderstorm. And it began to rain. I went across to close the French door. That's the first time I saw him out there.
Bad?
What time is it?
Cold?
That man over there. He was in the hotel lobby.
Quite sure you saw him in the hotel lobby?
They're going to arrest me.
If you meant it, you wouldn't show it to me, Betty.  Or am I supposed to deliver it to dear Inspector Killaine?
There's a lot of water between Vancouver and the U.S.A. This note is a suicide note.  After you're gone where would they look for you?  Why would they look for you? Darkness, and open water, and a fast cabin cruiser.  And I have a pocket full of money.  And if I helped you, I'd be committing a crime, or so they tell me.
Take me where I haven't the courage to take myself.
Blonde, beautiful, and sad--and nowhere.  Of course she might have run away--if she knew how.  And where to go.  She might have dyed her hair.  Bleached it before probably.  And changed her name again.  But look at this note.  And look at her room in the hotel. Her stuff is all there.  Hasn't a rag except what she stood up in. You don't run away like that.  Not if you are young and beautiful. No chance.
If you're doing all this just for me.
It wasn't the time or place.  Don't worry about the note, baby.  I'm playing for my neck now.
Would I want to?
Yes, Miss.
Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
Beer or ale, Miss?
I'm sorry.
FLorida?
Down below's Stanley Park. On the other side of the trees, there's a beach. You can see it.  Steveston's over there. Coast Guard station.  There's the Yacht Club, and beyond it, the docks. The over on the other side of the inlet, there's Grouse Mountain. It's about 4000 feet high. There's a restaurant on top of it. Very nice restaurant.  I'm sorry we couldn't have met in pleasanter circumstances, Miss Mayfield.
We're 98 per cent certain Mitchell was murdered. There are a lot of reasons.  Was he very drunk when you last saw him?
I wouldn't make you talk about it. My job is the death of Marry Mitchell.  Why can't you give me your confidence?
If I understand what you meant by that.
This isn't a very good place to talk.
I expected nothing else.
Palm trees against a sunset--waves breaking on a coral reef--the Taj Mahal by moonlight--roses in an English garden, just after a shower--  Clichés, one and all--but good ones, with a lot of mileage left in them--there's one thing he does not see--murder--and murder was what he was sent to find.  Pretty ridiculous, isn't it?
That's they're business.  Can I drop you somewhere?
But I tell you---if you'd only understand.
And there's a Mr. Goble to see you. Says his business is personal.
What have you got on Miss Mayfield?
You hurt my feelings. I ought to raise the price to be a thousand.
I go home and paint the kitchen.
Sorry. Another client paid for that. You can hire me not to use it.
Hi Margo. Hello Killaine. You two come together?
You make friends quickly, don't you, Clark?
And without much discrimination.
How are your teeth getting along?
What's this in favor of?
That's what I like about cocktail parties. Everyone is so perfectly natural.
How about a cup of coffee?
How are you two getting along?
I would.  Fancy waking up every morning with that in your lap.  Wonderful thing, money is.  Remember what Somerset Maugham said about it ?
I have a warrant for her arrest.
I've always thought you were a pretty nice guy, Brandon.  I'd like to go on thinking so.  If you tried to help her get away--
Information.
Not if she knew she wouldn't be believed.
You do a lot of real estate trading, Brandon?
I tried it once.  I lost my shirt.
I had a father who knew how to steal.
Want to walk out... or get thrown out?
Good afternoon, Mr. Campbell.
I'm getting positively haggard. In a couple of years people will be describing me as well preserved.
So much less refined than frizzling them in the chair.
What do you want?
So he did--but he hasn't told you what he saw. I have.
One of these days, you're going to wake up in the middle of the night and find that you've cut your throat.
The Harbor police have just picked up a dead man out of the water.
You have two murders to investigate. This man's head was beaten in. And there's nothing in his pockets.
I got through to Greer, his partner in the detective business.  Greer won't give out.
Send that?
The Super's just given me the sweetest dressing down I've ever had.  I'm still reeling from it. And believe me, I had it coming. I apologize.  What you think is important--I think is important.
I'm looking for Mr. Brandon.
It'll be a tough dollar when guys like you learn the alphabet.
Right.
Not too hard, is it?
You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder.  What are you going to do about it?
No suicide.
Scotch and plain water, I think.
You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
You couldn't possible have traced it this soon--not possibly.
Yes, I think so.  Here are two glazed manila envelopes.  One is the bag type.  The other one had the money in it.  Don't ask me how I know.  I know.
He checks too.
This gun permit was issued to Clark Brandon?
No.
Which forces me to arrest her against my better judgment.
Are you a policeman or a soft-headed nincompoop?
So-so.
Rich? I haven't the faintest idea. Why?
I don't. My hunch is she's just torn up an unhappy marriage. I was able to do her a small favor.
What's this?
It's against the law to cross the border with a gun. The Canadian police might like to know about this.
I told you she's just..
Mr. Penfield.  I am sorry to have kept you.
My first husband worked for the BBC.  I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about.  I became involved too.  I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it.  By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
I see.  Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
To Ann.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
But I'm not an interviewer or a correspondent.
How's Mary?
Would you like a dessert...I'm having one.
James... I can't begin to tell you how pleased we all are.  Congratulations, and I really mean it.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
What did you think of that Wadja film?
Good theory.  But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
Everyone describes the same process. At first it is exciting.  You're at the centre of the world.  As soon as anything happens, you're the first to know about it.  And there are deadlines a dozen times a day, even more, and that's intimidating and exciting.  Then you get the hang of it and the excitement wears off.  Your a clerk in a rather dowdy Office.  There's none of the glamour of television, or the penetration of serious journalism.  You're a processor of semi-official news.  Some people leave at this stage.  Then, if you hang on, and especially if you're promoted, you discover a new kind of pleasure.  You're pleased by the ease with which you can write summaries and bulletins from news agency printouts, by the way you ca judge length.  Ending a broadcast on the dot, having everything run smoothly, selecting a running order that makes sense, knowing instinctively what you can and cannot do.  Professionalism.
I might see you in Norfolk over the weekend.
...an innocent interest, and found out that last year Vogue ran a series called 'Mothers and Daughters' Number seven, Anne and Susan Barrington.  Being a decent loving friend I went to the files and made a copy for you.
Six onion bajees!  Great girl.  Did you shake the mother off?
What period?
Wait...and with talks at the United Nations still making little progress, tension and anxiety settled on MPs of all parties in Westminster.  Speaking on the Jimmy Young Show earlier today, Mrs Thatcher said the prospects of a peaceful solution did not look encouraging.  What is it?
I've got to be going.  I've got a meeting tonight.
Susan told me that your visits to Norfolk had ... well, an ulterior motive.
You're so famous now.
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools.  World history since 1945.  Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
Something happened.  You got nuked in the last quarter.
Mmm.  A lawyer, huh?  Too bad.  But at least you're surfing now.  So your life's not over yet, right?
So what's the biggest?  Waimea?
The only way to win out here is to surrender.  You have to feel what the wave is doing, accept its energy, get in sync.  Just feel it all moving in the blackness... you don't need to see.
We gonna jump or jerk off?
Don't screw around man, pull it!
What's this?
You gotta tell me where she is.
Why should I?
Pretty radical, Johnny.  Even for you.  Why don't you pull it?
You never were...
Yeah?  What?
You know less than nothing.  If you even knew that you knew nothing, at least that would be something, but you don't.
Yeah, I get it.  Time to play let's dick the old guys, huh, Harp?
Harp, let me tell you something.  I was an agent in this bureau when your mommy was still wiping your shinny pink ass, and you know one thing I learned in all those years that you still haven't?
Pappas.  Angelo Pappas.
Good move.
They don't go for the vault?
Yeah.  What's your theory?
Oh well he must be a surfer.
Johnny, it's the only way.
Big zippo so far.  How about you?
When did Harp say they'd have the warrant?
Johnny!  Uh, you, uh... should call first, you know?  Hey, where the hell were you all day?  You gotta at least call in or something.  You okay?
Bodhi, yeah.  I'm on him all day, right.  He goes here, he goes there, he goes to Tower Records and buys come CDs, he has lunch at Patrick's Road House...  ... he goes into the Assured Trust Savings and Loan.
Cute.  He was inside for about 20 minutes.  The other guy, Roach, waited in the truck.  They were scoping it out, right?!
I say we don't call it in.  Under no circumstance are we to call this in.
What do you want?
Gimme a break.  One shrimp and fries to go!  Anything to drink?
What is it?  You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
Nice place.
Meaning you were expendable.
Look at you.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you.  See, it's gone.  If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Those are cold.
I work bank robbery.  Guys I'm after are surfers.  I needed you, at first, but not--
My name's Johnny Utah!
We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us.
Thanks.
You lift off in three hours.  There's one other thing.
Where the hell is his body?
We're on the verge of closing a large navy contract.  Double is ridiculous but we can assure you a healthy profit on your shares.  We would give you a promissory note...
There's no way you could know that.
Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet?  I am.  This is Vivian.  You two been together long?  You and Edward?
It's... it's not like that.
You don't know anything about me.
The real estate possibilities are endless.  Most of the yard we'll just level.  I talked to a couple of developers, under the table, of course, and they said --
I... I would take advantage of it.
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Very good.  You're obviously mechanical.
So do day jobs.
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
You're joking.
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
Want to know something?  I don't quite know.  I hadn't planned this.
Uh-huh.
Try a strawberry.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
You really are a very beautiful girl.
What do you like?
No?  Why's that?
Not... quite.
Four thousand.
This isn't a date.
Hello?
You liked the guy, though.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
Can we talk about this?  Can you just try to calm down?
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Edward, I can't.
What if I lose it?
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you?  I don't.
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
Right.
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
I got tired of hating my father.
You're packing.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
What time's diner tonight?
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds.  Now, you're giving him the chance to get away?  As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
Looks slow tonight.
Couple a hours.
Yeah, what?
You bullshittin' me?
Housekeeping.  I come to turn down the bed.  5:00, I turn down the bed.
I'm just going to my room.
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
What is with you?
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
Would you like to try it on?
Yes?
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Don't even think --  -- don't even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. And don't dream of being rescued either. The only way in is secret. And only the Prince, the Count, and I know how to get in and out.
Brides often are, I'm told.
Who are you?
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
He knows I do not love him.
Rest, Highness.
You mock my pain!
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Singed a bit, were you?
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
You be careful.  -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
What?
Well, maybe I was a little bit concerned. But that's not the same thing.
Yes.
Maybe you could come over and read it again to me tomorrow.
Double it. My Princess must be safe.
For the last time -- SURRENDER!
Once we're out of sight, take him back to Florin and throw him in the Pit of Despair.
She's been like that ever since the Fire Swamp.  It's my father's failing health that's upsetting her.
I could never cause you grief; consider our wedding off.  You returned this Westley to his ship?
Your Princess is really a winning creature. A trifle simple, perhaps, but her appeal is undeniable.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
No --
-- all that I have and more please --
-- anything you want --
Humiliations galore!
We'll wait until you're ready.
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
You are wonderful!
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
Yes.
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
You're just stalling now.
What's so funny?
The chocolate coating makes it go down easier. But you have to wait fifteen minutes for full potency. And you shouldn't go swimming after, for at least, what?
You feeling any better?
You are sick, that's why he's here.
"He's gonna croon love's tune,
Yes, sir.  Thank you.
Good, what is it?
This is hardly a time for levity. I've discovered a serious error here in the accounts of your last play.
Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap.  Wake me if there's a fire.
Assume away!
What do you mean?
So what?  What did it get me?  I'm wearing a cardboard belt.
See?  You could have raised a million dollars, put on a sixty thousand dollar flop and kept the rest.
What scheme?
What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical.
Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better?
I got it, Mr. Bialystock.
Where would you like to eat?
Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right?
What kind now, Leo?
Mrs. Eleanor Biddlecombe.  She also owns 50% of the profits.
What are you doing?
But if something should... God forbid... go wrong, at least we could give them some of their money back.  It would look better in court.
Maybe it's not true!
Bloom, Bloom, maybe it's not true.
What are you doing with those books? Where are you going?
Here.  Buy bullets.  Kill.  Kill them all!
Max, I...
Don't help me.
My play?  You mean, "Springtime For ... " you know who?
I vas vit him a great deal, you know.
But he has long hair!
Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.
Here.  You see.  This is the slow fuse.  It is much wider.  It has more resistance, more density. Therefore, it burns slower.
Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks!
Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom.
Min Bialystock.
Wait.  Wait.  We can't play today. I have too many appointments.
Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench.
Of Siegfried...
Hindenburg...
The Graf Spee...
No, not at all sir, we're quite serious.  We want to produce your play.  I have the contracts right here.
"Deutchland, Deutchland, uber alles, Uber alles in der velt."
Mr. Liebkind, Mr. Liebkind.
Yes.  The actors.  I must destroy the actors.
Lorenzo Saint DuBois.  But everybody calls me LSD.
What did you tell the people?
I always forget to put the sign on, but we do have vacancy.  Twelve in fact. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.
No. At least I don't recall.
It was raining and her hair didn't look like that... damped out, I guess.
Very early. Dawn.
The following morning. Sunday.
No.
I live there. Alone.
She's... ill. Confined to her room. It's practically living alone.
Now, look...!
Sick old women are sharp. Come on, I won't disturb...
Let's all talk about Mary.
You can do anything you've a mind to... and bein' a woman, you will!  That yours?
I take it... you can prove that car's yours... I mean, out of state and all... got your pink slip and your...
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Forty thousand dollars.
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
Yes.
Did he say anything about my sister?
Yes?
I'm Mary's sister.
Here?
What should I know?
Nothing! You're putting me on the defensive.
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
Where... can I stay?
He'll be back. Let's sit still and hang on, okay?
Hundreds! Which one is your pet?
You want to run out there, bust in on Arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything Arbogast's been building for the last three hours.
Got the number of the motel out on the old highway? Bates, I think. 
I don't know...  One of us has to be here in case Arbogast's on the way.
Nothing.  Just... all the lights out... must be asleep.
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
I wonder so many things about her now.  Why she never told me about you...  Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
Sorry.
What?
Yes.  But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
It's regular. Okay?
Call your boss and tell him you're taking the rest of the afternoon off. It's Friday anyway... and hot.
You sure talk like a girl who's been married.
For what?
And I'm a working man! We're a regular working-class tragedy! 
Not even just to see you, to have lunch... in public?
Yeah, but when you do... you'll swing.
Dirty night.
We have twelve vacancies. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.  They moved away the highway.
Your home address. Oh, just the town will do.
I imagine so.
You go out... with friends?
You should... mind it.
Why don't you go away?
You're not going to... to your room already?
Phoenix?
Alright. I'll see you in the morning. I'll bring you breakfast.  What time will you...
No, m'am.
In the course of my duty, I never "take up" anyone's time, whether it's to give a warning, or a ticket, or help! Believe that, M'am.  Now if you woke up on the wrong side of... the car seat, that's one thing. But when you act as if I've just placed you under arrest...
May I see your license?
You mean that old woman I saw sittin' in the window wasn't Norman Bates' mother?
Why don't you call Norman and let him say just what happened, if he give the man a hot lead and he did just scooted off... it'll make the girl feel better, Albert.
Recluse. Kinder word.
Norman? Sheriff Chambers.  Been just fine, thanks. Listen, we got some worries here. Did you have a man stop out there tonight...  Well, this one wouldn't be a customer, anyway. A private detective, name of...
I helped Norman pick out the dress she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.
I'll get your bags.
I always thought it was the people who are alone so much who do all the talking when they get the chance. Yet there you are, doing all the listening!  You are alone here, aren't you?  It would drive me crazy.
My mother is not dead!
They thought she'd be coming to me.
Everyone concerned thought... if they could get her to give back the money... they could avoid involving her with the police.
Now wait a minute, Sam. You sure you saw an old woman?
You didn't even mention the suicides. Did you notice the beaut that came in today?
That's the one that's got the coroner doing nightwork.
Said &quot;doctor&quot;--[something]
It is--you know what a struggle he's had.
He hardly knew of them him- self.  I believe it was his uncle in Australia.
Gosh, you had me fooled.
No, I wouldn't be surprised at anything from you. Winningly. MAXWELL Now, honey--you are here in time to help me and you can--
Ha ha, <U>you</U> have been treating.
That's what I said. Now, lis- ten to me. I want you to help me take this woman down stairs. I will give her a shot. You can take care of her till I get help.
Yes--I can't stand it-- everybody wants papers-- oh, oh 
It may be, but to my notion, those that monkeys with what they got no business to get queer sooner or later.
[Lot of] How many cats you have--what's the matter-- rats?
I'm detective Jones. Just dropped in to tell you a bit of news.
By the way, where <U>is</U> your assistant?
Fine. Mrs. Buckley will be all right when she gets used to the idea.
By the time we return there, all the preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.
But you were in on it -- you worked for him.
Yes, why?
But what about lunch?
Why, certainly, sir. My fiancée. Charlotte, may I present Mr. Igor.
Nonsense. She's one of the nicest girls I know.
That's the way I feel about it.
Oh, please, Mr. Igor, I'm terribly ashamed. I shouldn't have put you to so much trouble.
Please, oh, please, I haven't done anything to hurt you.
Are you giving me this straight?
Not a very good one, I guess. He wasn't like anything human. He hobbled and swayed like a monkey, and the face, from the glimpse I got of it in the light from the street, was like an African war mask.
Hey, what do you think you're doing? Put that stuff back!
I'm through clowning. You're all washed up. Get out!
You cannot. I'm still editor of this sheet.
Which one is me? The horse?
Come in, Prussic Acid. What's on your mind?
All right, you poor baboon, you can guess the rest of it!
What!
No kiddin'?
Listen, stupid, could I do anything that would possibly meet with your approval?
Don't they? He's down at The Tombs right now.
Don't give this to anybody else, will you?
I told you he was a sore.
Well, I'll tell you a secret. I kinda like the old gent and I'm trying to build a special Sunday Magazine story out of him. It might help him a whole lot. But that's a side issue -- something I do on my own time.
Your dad has stood for plenty. Now let's get down to cases. When did you see the Dale girl last?
Hmmm. Why didn't you tell that to the police?
Now look here. It's not up to us to do our own detective work. I've had enough trouble over this matter. I don't want anything more to do with it.
Please. I'm sorry. I'll see it through. What do you want me to do?
There she is! You'll find Joan Gale in that box.
Why?
--and so determined to live that I'm going to get out and take a taxi if you don't watch where you're going.
What is it? What happened?
Well, what do you think I'm in this for?  Think of it, man, a match -- a cigar stub -- and ten thousand pounds to divide between us!
But I have some friends waiting.
What are you laughing at?
Yep. Everything settled.
Well, any time I can do anything for you --
A place you've never been.
Why am I doing this?
Could be.
Dysfunctional --
They're filthy, Mother.
I know, Mother.
I am in awe of it, Mother.
Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs?
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft.
Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe.
There's some kind of gristle in it, though.
Actually, I am, though.
All right, that's enough.  You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
No. No, you're not hurting me.  But I think you better quit it.
Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something?
Rose, you must know who the fellow is.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
I gotta find out what they're saying. You lie back and rest, Rose, and I'll give you a report on it.
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you!  The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
There goes Mother.
He kissed her.
She's putting the titty back.
What's goin' on?
Well, you rascal, where'd you come from?
How could that be, son?
What sad news? Did her cancer come back?
Is her husband sick or something?
But... but how? She was young! Rose wasn't old!
I can't believe it, Daddy. I know it must be true, but I can't believe it.
Well, it's a disaster. I don't know what to say, Doctor, I am floored. How dangerous is the operation?
Of course.
Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day.
Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road.
That is exactly what I'm afraid of.  The girl has got to go, darlin'.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
It has been three weeks since I "fired" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life?
She does look a little peaky.
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded.
You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do?
Well, thank God we are rid of her at last. And the best thing of all is that she's happy. The little nut is happy, she found Mr. Right in the nick of time!
Yes, sir.
Ahh-hem! Now, Rose, get off my lap. What are you doing, girl? Are you crazy?
That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on.
What have you got in your hair, girl?
Where do you want me to let you out, Rose?
All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance.  But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me?
Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it.
Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose.
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
Well, it was a silly question.
Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today?
Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job!
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
Galley what?
I don't mean that the way it sounds.  Imagine it, a book. And I used to know you personal way back when.  Tell me something, Buddy, how do you dream up all that stuff?
Heh heh heh heh, same old Buddy, always jokin' around. Almost as much of a joker as your Daddy.  I saw your Daddy a coupla years ago, I was up in Glenville lookin' at a motel site. I guess that's where you're headed, huh, to see him?
I see. Outside it.
Um-m, well...
Yes, dear, what is it?
Well, Mrs. Hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. But not many people walk away from double pneumonia, Madam, not many.
It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Oh, no, ma'am.
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
Well, you run on now.
Yes, Ma'am.
Never again, never again...
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
Rose, you don't have to.
You'll never guess what happened!  I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
I... I can explain...
Hasn't he got enough problems, or didn't you notice that's not cream soda on his breath?
You think it's that good?
A Lincoln?  What Lincoln?  Lincoln Continental?  Lincoln Mark Five... Six... ?
Take her down to the car, and for Christ's sake be careful this time.  Last suspect he took in, butter-fingers dropped her down the stairs.  What a mess.  Why is it we don't appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
Kittle...
Last time Billy-Boy did this, the guy's neck broke...  ... just like that.  Sad in a way. Why is it we don't truly appreciate our arms and legs till we've lost the use of them?
What'd I say?
You shouldn't litter.
Give a Hoot.  Don't Pollute.
Just a little, you know... Bicentennial memento.  Nothing special.
Sons of bitches!
I can work this.
I say, fuck 'em.  Let's go.
"A.D."
Wh... what... ?!
It doesn't say that.
Laugh it up.  You'll cry later.
Where we going?
Who said it wa's me, hub?  Anyway... he fell off a ladder.  It wasn't really my fault.
You live like a pig.
You plan on shooting that gun or just hugging it?
What about Jack Daniels?  Wasn't he a decorated general in the Civil War?
He tried to kill us.
You fuckers... damn you!  Why?!  Why me!?  Why the obsession with me?
Look out!  Jupiter and Saturn'll get you every fucking time.
I just think you should show some respect.  I mean, call me old fashioned, but 200 years ago when Ben Franklin and those guys signed the Constitution and Declaration of Independence, they did that so we could all share in the freedom...
If they crash, maybe he'll run.  You can shoot him in the leg or something.
That's right, white bread.  Give it up.  Right now.
What... ?  Not you too?
If it is, that's pretty high up on the totem pole.  What do you think?
How'd we do?
We're screwed.
This shit was Ming.
We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.
I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.
I can't do it, Ben.
To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again!
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.
I told you to remain on the command ship.
They are clear, my Master.
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.
Luke.
Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid.
Shall we try and go around?
Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment.
The code's changed. We need Artoo!
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando.
Well, look at you, a general, huh?
Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet.
What are you telling them?
Proper?!
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!
What do you remember?
Tell me.
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have.
No, you don't. You've always been strong.
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.
If that is your destiny.
Obi-Wan has taught you well.
You cannot hide forever, Luke.
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will.
You!
I see.  So this wasn't simply a chance meeting.  You came here with a purpose.
The future is ours so let's plan it.
Oh Janet
Oh Brad, I'm mad.
Yes, the rain has been very heavy.
Oh....Say something.
Right!
Hello.
Yes, well perhaps it was for the best.
You beast, you monster, what have you done with Brad?
Ssssh.  Brad's probably asleep by now. Do you want him to see you like this?
What a guy
What guy
Want to come again and stay
And left from my dreaming Was a feeling Of un-nameable dread.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime.
Sha la la la That ain't no crime. That ain't no crime.
No no no no.
No no no no.
Are you - giving a party?
Our noble mission is almost completed my most beautiful sister, soon we will return to the moon-drenched shores of our "androgenous" planet.
...How's the turtle food this week?
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
I just dislocated my finger.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
What's funny?
I would say you're very shy by nature.
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
Would ya like a glass of water?
D'you really wanna call?
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
...T-thank you.
I always knew you was pretty.
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
...And he called the reporters --
What was that you said about a pet shop?
...Can't do it.
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
...Paulie. Stop now!
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
Owe you what?
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
Apollo, how would you rate this last British challenger, Henry Wilcoxson?
I don't like ya face.
Kiss my ass.
'Cause we dig ya, man -- Gimme a dollar.
This a con?
Cost ya a buck.
If you had asked anyone who knows boxing, they never would've predicted a first round knockdown and the second round punishment to the body of the Champion... Most fighters will tell you, receiving a good body punch is the next worst thing to dying.
Without a doubt this is the most punishing brawl I have ever seen -- The ringside audience is spotted with blood. This fight should have been stopped rounds ago but Rocky Balboa refuses to fall --
Honest to God I'm broke -- Gimme a break.
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Mr. Balboa --
Rocky, would you be interested in --
What?
Listen, I hope ya don't --
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
More like thirty.
Rice is a bum.
What's happened is freak luck.
Fifty years, huh.
Please, kid.
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
Hey, Rock -- What happened?
No more, ya wanna lose an eye? No more.
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
Hey --
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
...Maybe I better forget it.
Why?
I got whiskey here.
You ballin' her?
To see ya train.
This is your largest payday ever -- How do you feel about it?
We don't serve formula. Snookums.
My problem is I come here to drink in peace.  So if you don't mind...
And another thing, the paper said no will was found.  But every Toon knows Acme had a will and, in it he promised to leave Toontown to the Toons.
The papers said the safe door was opened, Eddie.
So you're not even gonna bother to find out if the rabbit's gettin' framed?
Jesus, Eddie, is this who I think it is?
Eddie, you still got it.  Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
Eddie?  Jesus, what happened?
Oh... well, I... I just had to see you.
So altruistic.
It was Doom who killed Acme, you know?
So where is it?
Now what?
What the hell is that?
A hundred bucks?  That's ridiculous.
When will I hear from you?
Son-of-a-bitch...  Mr. Maroon, I think I'll be goin' now, so about the rest of my fee...
Hi, Mr. Maroon.  Remember me?
You tricked me, damn you!
Aah!
You mean to tell me you coulda taken your hand outta that cuff at any time?
Are you always this funny, or only on days when you're wanted for murder?
Yeah.  I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
How do you know that?
But that's my calling, my purpose, my raison d'etre.  Toons are supposed to make people laugh... and believe me, those people needed a laugh.
A laugh can be a powerful thing, Eddie. Sometimes it's the only weapon we have in life.
Hey, doesn't the rabbit even get a last request?
Valiant and Valiant?  Who's the other Valiant?
You damn Toon!  No wonder they picked you for the patsy.  Always gotta play the fool.  You make me sick!
Gee, Eddie, you're not gonna go, are ya?  Maroon'll be layin' for ya at nine o'clock.
What the hell are you doin' in there?
Real good, Rog... but maybe you better let me take over.
That's not blood.  That's ink.  That goof Acme squirted me with some the other day.  Why it's comin' 'through now, I don't know.
I think you oughta read it to her.
Pretty good cigar.  Where'd you get it?
Boo! Ah, ha ha. Ooh. Boo! Ha ha ha.
If she is well then nothing can be ill. Her body rests in Capel's monument, and her immortal part with the angel's lives. I saw her laid low. Pardon me for bringing these ill news.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Every man betake him to his legs.
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
Uncle, 'tis a shame.
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
Young son, it argues a distemper'd head so soon to bid good marrow to thy bed: or if not so so, then here I hit it right, our Romeo hath not seen his bed tonight.
Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes.
I thought thy disposition better tempered! Thy Juliet is alive. There art thou happy. The law that threatened death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile. There art thou happy. A Pack of blessings light upon thy back. Wherefore railest thou on thy birth the heaven and earth? Since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once.
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
Thou hast a careful father, child: One who, to put thee from thy heaviness, hath sorted out a sudden day of joy that thou expects nor I looked not for.
Marry my child next Thursday Morn. The gallant, young and noble gentleman, Sir Paris, at Saint Peter's Church, shall make thee there a joyful bride.
[Within] Juliet!
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
I have.
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Nurse, give leave awhile, We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again; I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel. Nurse, Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
Why, may one ask?
And so did I.
Meaning, to court'sy.
I will follow you.
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
Do you have it?
Of course.
Only the stupid ones.  Cigarettes kill more patriots than bullets.  Besides, I'm not IRA no more.
You call me with the target's route, I follow along until we've reached the attack point and then I run his squag ass off the road.
What is?
And what's that supposed to mean, Seamus Reilly?
Do I need to repeat myself?
I still am.
And when I consider that, I have to wonder if you don't have some ulterior motive for being here, with me, right now.
Who are you?  IRA?
It's quite satifactory.
Where's the case?
And more importantly --
What am I doing here?  Why, I'm here to see my partners, Gregor, the boys in the Russian Mafia.  See, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross.  But they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me.  I can't fight them, and they can't kill me -- that means we're gonna have to do business together.
Sent it where?
Gregor, is that you?
It was a mistake, it shouldn't have happened.
A means to an end, is that it?
Hello, Jean-Pierre.
So what is it you want to know?
The point remains: we could be working for different people.  There's a chance for one of us...  Maybe more than one of us -- has been paid to cross the others.  I don't know about you guys, but I like to know who I'm working for.  It can help prevent a great deal of...  ...unpleasantness.
It's been known to happen.
After we stop the target car I get out and use the heavy artillery to kill the driver and his bodyguard.
I don't particularly like killing, tubby, but I want you to know that this one I'm going to enjoy.
Cigarette?
Where to?
Pretty much what you'd expect.
Exactly.  Why not bring them?
What's going on?
You know, what you pulled back there, that was bullshit.
How did you know?
You're a cop...you're a fucking cop...I should kill you.
Continue when it would be so much easier to give it up.
Do we need anything else?
Not here.  They might see it.
The mark of a true Samurai.  What I do for the Company, Vincent, is no different than what you do.  We're both hired guns, and this is a job -- like any other job.
Let's get him out of here...
"Your field dressing saved his life." That's three I owe you.
Tell me something first.  The package: what was it?
What's the story?
Why didn't you kill her?
I was wondering if you had any movies that were particularly new.
Seamus Reilly, boy's a serious Irish Auteur -- a real firebrand.  Thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace-loving pussies, if you see what I'm saying.
Whatsamatter with you?  Aren't you concerned about all of this?
Ready to roll, partner?
How old is Otis anyhow, thirty?
All right hold on!  Lemme think...  Shit, did you touch the car?
I've got one condition.
I don't know!  Son of a bitch! Who the hell are you?
That's not what I mean.
He would have done it to us, right?
Well I'm not!  Thinks he's got us by the balls.
And how do you figure we do that?
You're out of your mind.
You think he's bluffing?
It's gonna be o.k.
I don't know for sure, but why else would they head for the bank?
I understand your logic, Booth, but I don't think...two thousand's going to raise any eyebrows, do you?
Well I don't know what's going to happen next -- she's pressing this, another interrogation, another problem.
You don't expect us to believe that do you?
How are ya?
Well, not that I wouldn't sugar bun but Earl's in a bind.  They're going to take his car.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
What's wrong?
You got me something?  What's the occasion?
What happened to your cheek? SALLY Oh I...nothing...
And I'd end up a widow in two ways.  Let's forget it.  I'll just be a little more careful next time.
We'd... I don't know...go to California, New York, maybe a house on a Swiss mountainside...
I don't know, Booth.
Why does that bother you?
Sally there's a whole world out there.  We can have a new home. A real home, not some tin-plated dump.  What are you giving up?
Things just got a little screwed up, that's all.
Sally, do you love me?
Be more specific.  A month, a week...
Test the product?
Business is business.  Now where the hell is it?  I wanna get out of here.  That's the plan, we're just flunkies, you know what I'm saying?
What is this?  Don't be stupid man...
All right, deputies, take care, don't let your meat loaf.
Yeah.  I told him I'd be there before five.
Dwayne...  It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there.  Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
OK...this is good.  Our first solid lead.
Some of it.  Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
Anything I can help you with?
I have an anniversary coming up, thought I'd buy her something special.
Yeah, she is.  She comes up to about here on me.
A lot of men come in here?
No.  But what I would like is the forty dollars you owe me, and I’m a busy man.
Aw, now that’s gonna take time to clear!
Do you even have a girlfriend, Jesse?
Where's the hot back -- the therapeutic pad thing?
I'll settle for a third of that.
Oh Jesus Christ...
Don't hurt me.
Thank you honey.  are you sure you don't want it?
That fire was set.  Deliberately. And probably not by anyone found at the scene.
I don't know how else you'd explain it.  The coroner's estimated time of death for everyone there was long before this fire started, unless of course Denning started it, and that doesn't make much sense.
You think he skipped town?
You assumed a brother coming in here can only afford five-hundred dollars a roll, is that right?  Are you a racist?
Winner six!
Invitation, please.
Hear you got your ass kicked in Hong Kong, James.
How'd you know?
So tell me what you know.
What?
How you doing, baby?  My name is Prince Mubutu from Nigeria.
San Juan!  You must know my good friend Pedro Martinez Hernandez Hector Elizondo.
Red Dragon?  You sure about that?
Look, I've been working this case for months now...
How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses?
You bring American money?
That's what I'm talking about.  A real Hong Kong night club.  You want an Altoid?
I'll meet you at the bar in ten minutes. They don't like tourists in here, so try to blend in.
Carter, get off that stage!
Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China.
What'd I say?
Hello.
Goddamn you got a small ass.
Where are you going?
Not Yu.  You!
What, leave you alone so he can cap you?
What are you gonna do about it, grasshopper?
I heard your mama pulls a rickshaw.
Who?
Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic.
Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking?
He'll be back soon.
My fiancee left me over the summer -- a month before our wedding.
No.  It was my singing.
She's just standing around -- not doing much.
I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice?
No.  It's not right.
What's she doing?
I don't want to hear this.
Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs?
I wouldn't do that!!!
Secret Service Agent Carter.  This is my calling, Lee. Give me six months and I'll be in Washington protecting a white guy.
If she was the right girl, you'd be thinking about her.
How was the sex?
Steamed dumplings?
That's rough, man.  If I don't get steamed dumplings once a week, I go crazy.
As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice.
Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity.
You could never kick my ass.  You mama's boy.
Ricky Tan is alive.
You go after Ricky.  I got this.
What is this?
They owe us, man.  That's the least they can do.
First class.
I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that?
You move well.
The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in.
I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service?
Master Ching taught me.
Lee, there was a bombing at the American Embassy.  Two American translators were killed.
... if your father were alive, I would be turning to him now.  I didn't blow up the American Embassy, but I believe some of my people did.  My enemies are trying to frame me.  There is a war going on within the Triads -- and I am going to lose.  My name has been written into the book of death.
You're just like your father, Lee.  All these years hiding behind his badge.  I wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change.  When you think about it, I didn't really kill him.  I just put him out of his misery.
I need your help, Master.  I'm seeking a man who used to train with you.  He's become a killer - the worst kind of animal.
A seeding spends its entire life reaching towards Heaven.
The answers you seek can be found in Heaven on Earth.
Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us.
Carter.  I just want to be able to tell the Ambassador who was responsible for the death of his daughter because he talked too much.
What you did was dangerous and completely outside policy.
Ooo, there's a chill.  Love that.
You talk very fast.
Bullshit a little.  You lied to me.
It's the same thing!
-- what the hell is that?
I could not come.  I had other responsibilities.
I also did not come because I think I would not fit in America.
When we go inside, you let me handle everything, you hear?  This is my man, you dig?  My informant. You know what an informant is?
That's not how it goes.
No, no.  It's not good-God you all! It's Good-God, ya'll.  Ya'll!
Not yee-aw, Ya'll.  And it's gotta be angry.  Like you're pissed off.
Are you OK?
Want some?
What?!
OK, when you go in, just act like you're from outa town.
Oh no.
Oh my god. Griffin.
Yeah...beautiful. What would you call that paper there? Kind of a...Robin egg blue color?
Well.. I wouldn't want to be in the way.
Yeah, if you're Superfly.
Any demands yet?
What the hell am I supposed to do with him? Take him to the zoo?
Oh yeah.  The caller was a man. Confident.  Had an accent.  My guess, Asian.  Anything else I can do for the FBI, sir?
I oughta pat your ass down.  Make sure you're not a cop.
Okay, look, we're gonna make a trade. You cross the street, leave her on the sidewalk.  I will leave him on this side.  Then we trade places.  You get him, I get her.  Get the picture, Lois?
You're movin' to death row. See, your fingerprints are now on the murder weapon of Four FBI Agents. And when I turn this into the lab, they're gonna find Lafontaine all over it. And we already know...  ...this is your MO.
Where do we find him?
Yes.
I am not an American, Mr. Russ.  My daughter is not an American.
I am so sorry about your men.
I will not have friends in America.
You don't understand this guy.
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
What do you expect me to say to this?
You look awful.
Really?
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
Tell me, why does Maggie need another wedding rehearsal and two days before the wedding?  She's already done this.
Fully.  I like her.  She has wit.
-- It's for you, Ike.
Maggie!
Or a vegetarian?
No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
No.  I call it like I see it.  I'm a journalist.  I'm a truth teller.
Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Yes, I am.  And who are you?
Oh, Betty.  I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Give me that!
Look, look, man.  I think the man is heartbroken.
Too much.
I'm a work in progress.
I don't know.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
Yes, you!
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career.  So, what are you doing here?
You were not.
I'm listening.
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
Grandma!
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
What are you talking about?
You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
Even when you were young?
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
When you get back, I'll be gone --
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
It's not true, but it feels true.
What's with you?
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
What?
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" -- 
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
What?
I love you, too.
But he saw you, right?
You don't know who she was, Annie --
This is a photo of hair.
Becky?
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
No, I know that part --
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
It's probably just the flowers --
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
You know.
Magic.  It was magic.
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home.  It's almost like...
Hello.
I'm not mad at you.  Okay, I'm not mad at you.
It's been about a year and a half.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
Is he home right now?
Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
It is not --
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
I can hear you walking around sometimes.  At first I thought it was a robber.  Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
What?!
What?
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"--  What is that?
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean.  I wonder if it still works this way.
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
It was sinking.
Our house.  There was water coming in all the windows.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
Did you call that radio station again?
Everyone at work heard you.
Did too.
Yes?
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
You saw her in the airport and then here?
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
Oh.
I read an article about this ...
I told you it would happen. It's bound to happen when a man works alone!
Are you going to let us pass -- or do I have to call the Sheriff?
Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law, you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.
He says give 'em equality. Equality in jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.
Super's busy -- with your Negotiatin' Committee.
Now wait a minute. Super's the one made the rule. He ain't gonna give you no helper.
To the mine?
Come on, Esperanza -- how about it? We got to.
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula.  I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
We can't get everything at once. Right now we've got more important demands.
First we got to get equality on the job. Then we'll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.
Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was like before the union came?  When Estella was a baby, and we couldn't even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met in graveyards to build that union!
Is that all you care about? That radio? Can't you think of anything except yourself?
Was it expensive, the beer?
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
What's the matter?
A fighter, huh?
Must've been some experience for you, huh?
I guess you got enough today to last a lifetime, huh?
I'm telling you. I don't stay home with these kids tomorrow.
How do you feel?
Where are you going?
When?
You mean you're ready to give up?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
Go on. Spill it.
No. New York.
What are you doing here?  Something wrong with Mama?
Where's your mama?
Papa, can't I leave now? There's a meeting of the Junior Shop Stewards ...
But you've got me doing everything. Mama never used to make me dry the ...
Ramón ... listen for the love of God ...
You got a bathroom I can use before we hit the road?
Bobby?
What can I do for you?
Yeah, but he was in silhouette.
Look...I'd like to help you out ... but I really don't want to get involved.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Go ahead.
You don't understand.
Why don't you call the cops?
Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure.  By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set.  Where's Quincey?
What do you want from me, Colette?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
What are you hiding, Danny?
I'm kind of busy.
We been through that.
No, you're wrong, I tried to tell myself the same thing but I could have gotten up. I could have done something.
How you holding up?
I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz.  No one can.  And you can't forgive for me.
I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred.  Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her.  Do you know what that feels like?
How the hell did we get this detail?
Where to?
Was.  I'm on the fucking ghost train right now, man.  You got anything for me?
What?
I think so.  I mean, we'd have to talk to him.
Why do they call him Pooh-Bear?
You're going to have to explain that one.
What does J.F.K. stand for?
What's this?
What the hell is that?
What?
But... why? Why would you pretend?
I don't know... a little. I wish you would have let me in on it from the beginning.
Wouldn't be a favor if you were paying me. I'll just take my five when the deal is done.
I'm gonna get this developed and send it to the Warren Commission.
Yeah, I uh, have a buyer who's looking for about a quarter's worth.
Can we talk price?
I don't know, 14,000 a kilo?
Okay ... How about um .. 6,000 a ounce.
You want to do this some other time?
Captain Steubing thinks you might work for the police.
This is bullshit.  You didn't say anything about anybody else being here.
You don't find that repugnant?
I met the guy at a party.  He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
Bullshit. He's a liar.
Guy scores dope and dollar from ripping off other drug dealers.  As least that's what the word is.
What? Is it bad?
Danny?
This the guy?
Turns out he's connected.
The Mexicali Boys
He knows somebody ratted him.
Fuck you, Garcetti. I been at this for almost a year. I've done everything you guys have asked of me.
He's the only one I told.
Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
Excuse me?
Why doesn't Palmdale P.D. just raid the guy?
We're coordinating with Palmdale P.D.. We'll have your sorry ass covered.
When is the deal going down?
You mean like the Donner Party?
Tom, quit fucking around.
You think that's a good idea?
And believe me, word will get out that you're a pro rat.
We're in business.
What is that? Rum and coke?
Jesus Jimmy, you at the alpha team.
Yes, sir.
Pinned down, a mile east of here, waiting for some help from the navy guns.
Sir?
A private, sir?
But, sir...I...I...
Good luck, John.
In the back of a nineteen and thirty- one stretch Hudson with a big ole' trailer.
Yep.
No one's gonna win the money for the simple reason that the Captain never was a civilian.  They assembled him at O.C.S. out of spare body parts from dead G.I.'s.  I know this for a fact.
He ain't Wade.
Well, I'll be goddamned, I knew it.
Where?
What the hell's the matter with you, Jackson?
Sir, I understand what you're doin', but I respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.
Sir, I understand.  I don't like it, but I understand.
How about that jeep?
That only leaves three.
I'd like to stay, too, Captain.
I can tell what the gunners had for dinner.
Upham, you've got to learn the difference between whining and griping.  You can't just rely on natural ability, you've got to study and practice.
You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
You think they'll be alright?
Yeah?  What rule of thumb is that?
SHOVES THE NEEDLE into Wade's neck. Thick vein.  Pumps the morphine straight to Wade's brain.  Motions impatiently to Sarge.
You alright?
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother.  Have I ever told you about her?
No problem.  A pair of deuces?  Less? So what?  I bluff.  It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do?  Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do?  Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier.  Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
Oh, yeah?
John, I've got to tell you, I think you're about used up.
What are we going to do?
Captain, can I put in for a transfer?
Sir, what if they send some other company into Caen ahead of us while we're pinned down here?
Sorry, I need a B.A.R. man, you're the best.
Captain, can I ask you a question?
I'd much rather die in Caen than Ramelle, sir.  It's a personal thing.
Well, maybe not the Captain, but the rest of us have mothers.
Any further thoughts on the subject?
B:  Ryan is dead.  He's been blown up by the German equivalent of Wade, whose name I know you don't want me to mention.  There's nothing to find. The biggest piece is the size of a pea.  We wander around, looking for him until the Germans pick us off, one after another.
Neither do I, sir.  C:  And this is the worst one, we find Ryan and he's wounded.  Not only does he not carry my gear, we have to carry his gear. And him.
Looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, Captain.
Leave him to me, Captain, I'll have him pissing and moaning with the best of us.
What deal?
FIRES a burst.  Germans drops.
Doesn't move.  He just stares at Sarge's body.
Oh, Christ, now we gotta listen to that grandfather thing again.
Who cares?
But everybody's heard of him, he won the Congressional Medal of Honor, he saved a dozen men.
Sir, I ran the 220 in high school.
On guard, glancing back.  Pissed off.
Demolition, right?
How fast?
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
This evening is over.
No, I'm not married.  It's for my daughter.
Thanks, I like yours too.
C'mon, just do it.
Alright.
What does it say?
Trapped in the body of a gameshow hostess.
Hey, I know this is a strange thing to say, but maybe Diane Court really likes Lloyd.
I'll put this past my boss
No, wait a minute.  Everybody thinks you're what?
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
Morning honey.
You bet you should have called.  You still live at home.  Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
Sweetheart, no.  Don't be ridiculous.
Alright, alright.  Go ahead.  When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
Why are you being so hateful to me?  Is this because of Lloyd?
Hello.
Mom, please?
This is me telling you about me.
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
You will?
Yeah.  I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Yeah.
Well...
Alright.  This is really great.  Alright, we're going out. It's a date.  It's a scam.  Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
Eight. Eight O' clock.
So it's an honor?
So we can finally talk?
Thank-you.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Sure I do.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
Oh.
Me?  Sure I do.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
Yes.
Yeah.  With potential.
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
Yeah, a little bit.  Listen, this is important.  When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
I don't know.  I'm happy.
It did?
I've never sent a letter like that, you know?  I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
I feel like a dick.  You must think I'm a dick.
Yeah you do.
You shared it with a dick.
You told your dad?
Then don't do it.
You do?
Hurt me again?  Not a chance, don't worry about it.
I'm fine.
Okay.
You're freaking out here man.
No my brother, you have to go buy your own.
PAIN!
The guy with the Datsun?
The truck?
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
What?
How ya doing?  Is she around?
Yeah Lloyd.  What are your plans for the future?
Seriously, Lloyd.
Joe.  Joe.  She's written sixty-five songs.  They're all about you.  They're all about pain.
My car.
Don't make this like a counsel, Lloyd. I got statistics I can show you, I got graphs I can show you.  That's all the stuff I can show you, it all says the same thing.  You have to decide on a career.
Ooop, excuse me.
I was gonna...
You know, every year I throw this party, every year nobody helps me clear up.  Why am I yelling?
I don't know.  Good on you man.  Alright Lloyd.
Certainly.
I love you man
Oskar - my friend Lena.
Now you're back.
Well, let's find him.
The gentleman thinks a mistake's been made.
You know what, you'd like her.
It's not a charade, all this?
Your friend Amon Goeth has been arrested.
There are some things that are unclear. We need to talk.
Do you have any idea what's involved? The paperwork alone?  Forget you got to build it all, getting the fucking permits, that's enough to drive you crazy.  Then the engineers show up.  They stand around and they argue about drainage - I'm telling you, you'll want to shoot somebody, I've been through it, I know.
You held back Stern.  You held back the one man most important to my business.
What do you want for him, I'll give it to you.
You took my workers.
When?
What are you, Moses?  What is this? Where's the money in this?  What's the scam?
You're not telling me something.
This is not my problem.
What do I got for you?
You have any idea what a shirt like this costs?
What's wrong with it?
Oh, God, you don't have a drink?
What was that about the SS, the rate, the ... ?
This, I don't know, maybe you can trade it for something.
I got to go, I'll see you.
I know what you're saying, but I don't see the difference.
If I'd made more money ...I threw away so much money, you have no idea. If I'd just ...
What's he done that's so bad - take money? That's a crime?  Come on, what are we here for, to fight a war?  We're here to make money, all of us.
We know that, son.
We're going to bring her in. Hide her out for a coupla days. And we're issuing a campus lock-in this evening. No one is allowed out after dark.
That shit. He only calls you when he's drunk. Don't go over there.
Don't. Think Bailey.
Kill, kill, kill, kill, hah, hah, hah, hah...
Hang up...call...
Why do you always answer a question with a question?
WHAAAATT?
I don't think that's a good idea.
How? What could I say that would make a difference? I took away a year of your life--how do I apologize for that?
It helped me realize one thing.
I get my revenge and make some fast cash.
Look, I'm sorry about the face.
Fair enough.
Well, you know I'm dear to the subject matter.
Hi, Gale, any leads?
What are you going to do?
But you’ll never get away with it.
No way.
It's okay. I can peddle toilet paper.
Lemme take you home.
This is exactly what I don't want.
I don't really know what happened in Woodsboro, Sid. But I know you don't trust me.
Two.
He sent me the cutest e-mail.
You’re the one who got away.
Of course not. Who wants to? What’s the point if we don’t get caught? Where’s the glamour in that?
..so we had to be different but yet the same because if you venture to far away from your orginal story you completely alienate the audience...
We had to have financing.
I've been trying to reach you but you haven't returned...
Yes, Miss Weathers, your name is embedded clearly between my ears.
You have every right to be upset.
I never meant to imply...
You're a hard one to figure out. GALE It's that complex yet shallow quality. It's deliberate.
If you were truly a copycat, wouldn't you want to emulate everything about the killer that you could?
He's already gotta be a part of Sid's life. What do you know about this Derek?
You broke my heart.
And it's sexier in the dark.
This is all too familiar.
Let's go.
Look, Sid, why don't you take off? Disappear for a few days. I'll come with you.
You go, it's all stairs, I can take it from here.
It seems to be causing a stir. What's with the toilet paper?
You're going to get it. You know what happens.
Okay, you're sure about skipping Calculas?
No, girletta, I don't leave your side.
It's okay to break, girl. You shatter if you have to.
I'm the only one who can cut him down.
Randy Meeks.  He was with Sid that night in Woodsboro.
I'll stop by the Deltas tonight.
Sid, I'll seeya tonight.
It's all about sisterhood. Everybody thinks its about partying and blowjobs but...
Hello?
Take it off.
You ass.
I'll be right back.
What do you want?
Do you work for her now?
Oh that's right. Those poor poor people. God Ben Damon was such a hottie.
What do you mean?
I don't watch TV and I hate books. Whatta you need?
Jesus Christ you scared the shit out of me.
Well I interviewed Damon once for the show. He was a real obnoxious fuck. Any way, the second one, Christine Perkins, she had a part in Stab 2, didn't she? She was playing CICI.
I've tried to get in touch with Sidney Prescott, but she's keeping herself very well hidden. You're my one and only hope in finding her. Her life may be in grave danger.
Oh. I thought you wanted me to stick around.
Please, call me Gale.
Whoever it is, now is taking credit for Maureen Prescott's murder.
Must be exciting, Beautiful place, beautiful people.
What do you mean?
Ghosts are tough,  you can't shoot ghosts.
That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.
Before you jump to conclusions, the man in the picture, COTTON WEARY, is out of the country on business. His alibi checks out. Seems he's got a TV show in Australia, 100% COTTON. It's supposedly the biggest thing down under since Yahoo Serious, but that's besides the point.
Is that a threat, Detective?
Detective Kincaid?
Sidney, do you have any idea how he could've gotten your number?
Jesus Christ Sidney, what happened? I got a call on my cell from home. They told me that someone was attacked.
I was afraid they were bait, something to, ya know,  trick you out of hiding.
Alright Sid, over there is the STAB 3 Production offices. That's where Sarah Darling was murdered last night.
Do you really mean it this time Gale?
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police got a call from a woman who said she was with 'Stab 3'.  She wanted to see the file on Sid, for research.
The boys said no.  She wouldn't give her name. A month later, the station gets broken into, the file room ransacked.
Don't worry. I'm prepared for anything.
I've got an idea, I'll hook up with you guys later.
Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Geez.
Rob Reiner and Quentin Tarentino?
Just because you knew her?
But you know my favorite name?
What are you talking about? The murders were a completely isolated incident.
Roman and everybody else went home for the night. I'm here for a make-up test.
Do you think it's over Sidney? Do you?
I want to finish what I started. I want to finish the game.
If you lay a hand on him I'll fucking kill you!
{ a click } I only her you too, Sidney.
Hello?
No I need to call you. Just you.
How'd you do?
Dude. What are you doing here?
You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night.
What if your father snapped? Your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...
You rode your bike out there?
Billy? What the...
Close call.
No... I don't... it's just... Oh God, Billy, someone was there, someone tried to kill me.
I think in some weird analytical, psychological bullshit way I'm scared I'm gonna turn out just like her, you know? Like the bad seed or something...
You heard me.
It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE!
I don't understand...
I don't know.
Uh... HALLOWEEN. You know, the one with the guy with the white mask who just sorta walks around and stalks the baby sitters. What's yours?
I have to go now.
Nah, I don't think so...
What's his name?
...please... no...
...leave me alone... please...
Hi! Gale Weathers. Field Correspondent, INSIDE STORY.
Productive. So they're closing down the school?
I just turned 25. I was 24 for a whole year.
Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out.
A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
What are you doing here?
Does mom know?
What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law.
No, Dewey. You'll ruin the whole night.
Should I be worried?
It's Deputy Riley today, Sid.
I was first to respond.
She's tough.
Hold off for now. Just stay close to her.
Where is she?
Casey? Where are you honey? Call the police, goddamnit.
Where is she?
If I'm gonna blow this up -- I need hard proof.
I'm not here to fight.
I think you falsely identified him. Yes.
Not one word. He admits to having sex with your mother but that's all.
Where do you get this shit?
Aha, Randy, you gave yourself away. Are you calling from work? Tatum's on her way over.
I like that thing you're doing with your voice, Randy. It's sexy.
Are you alone in the house?
Can you see me right now?
Good try, Randy. Tell Tatum to hurry. Bye now.
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy... again.
Have a good trip.
I thought Blockbuster fired you.
And are the police aware you dated the victim?
You coming tonight?
So what's his reason?
She's saving herself for you.
We could be like two grief stricken students and we'll say really nice things about our good friends who were slaughtered senselessly.
Yeah.
If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
Guess, I won't be needing this anymore.
Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside.
Fucking clueless -- they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors...
Uh-huh, it's just... you know, the police and reporters... it brings it all back.
It's okay. She was supposed to pick me up.
Do you really think Billy did it?
It was just some sick fuck having a laugh.
This could be good. What do you think, Sid?
What do you think about when you're having sex?
No way.
TATUM!
You don't.  It goes to court now.
There are seven deadly sins.  Gluttony, wrath, greed...
What's this: "I'm declining this case?"  It don't work that way.
Come on.  What are you going to do with yourself out there?
Did you read in the paper today, about the man who was walking his dog?  he was attacked, and his wallet and his watch were taken.  And then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes.  It happened four blocks from here.
Well, there he sits.  It's not supposed to make sense.
This guy paid me five hundred bucks to bring it out here.  He wanted it here at exactly seven o'clock.
I don't believe it.
What time is it?
Give me the gun.
Where we headed?
What makes you so special that people should pay attention?
I hate to burst your bubble, but other than the fact that you're especially sadistic, there's nothing unusual about these precious murders of yours.
I... I doubt I enjoyed it any more than... Detective Mills would enjoy some time alone with me in a room without windows.  Isn't that true?  How happy would it make you to hurt me, with impunity?
You wouldn't because you know there are consequences.  It's in those eyes of yours, though... nothing wrong with a man taking pleasure in his work.  I won't deny my own personal desire to turn each sin against the sinner.  I only took their sins to logical conclusions.
You should be thanking me.
And, I remember breaking your nose.  You're only alive because I didn't kill you.
I... I don't follow.
It's very simple.  You worked a nice, quiet town, but you fought to get here as if your life depended on it.  I've just never seen it done that way before, Detective.
The badge in my pocket says "detective," same as yours.
It's too soon for him.
It's a package deal.  You get the phone with the office.
Well?
You've never seen "The Odd Couple?"  This is sick.  "The Honeymooners?!"
The leather chair was soaked through with sweat.
No fingerprints?
What the fuck is that?
He just may be nuts enough.
All we do is pick up the pieces.  We take all the evidence, and all the pictures and samples.  We write everything down and note what time things happened...
Does this make it with you?
Never in my twenty-four years, knock on wood.  I've only ever taken my gun out five times with the actual intention of using it.  Never fired it though.  Not once.  You?
I think Hemingway wrote somewhere... I can't remember where, but he wrote that in order to live in a place like this, you have to have the ability to kill.  I think he meant you truly must be able to do it, not just faking it, too survive.
Listen to me.  He's all about playing games.
Hey, Freud, what brand of bullshit are you shoveling, huh?  Right now he's probably dancing around his room in a pair of his mommy's panties, singing show tunes and rubbing himself with peanut butter...
Sooner or later his luck's goning to run out.
Well, he's been right so far, hasn't he?
Just, realize... this is not some common lunatic.  The type of intestinal fortitude it must take... to keep a man bound for a full year.  To connect tubes to his genitals.  To sever his hand and use it to plant fingerprints.  He's methodical and exacting, and worst of all, he's patient.
Flagged books cover every topic the Bureau deems questionable... communism to violent crime.
Yeah.  Some college student who's taking English 101 and just happens to be writing a paper on Twentieth Century Crime.
This is a waste of time.
I know, I know... focusing on one little thing.
Wait... just wait.
Think about it...
You stupid son of a...
He's preaching.
Don't try to focus on things as black and white, because you'll go blind.  There's no winning and losing here.
You tell me, then... you walk into an apartment, and a man has beaten his wife to death, or the wife murdered the husband, and you have to wash the blood off their children.  You put the killer in jail.  Who won?
Where's the victory?
What the fuck is wrong with you?  What burnt you out?
Oh, you're so much better than everyone, right?  No one's worthy of you.
Listen to yourself.  You say, "the problem with people is they don't care, so I don't care about people."  But, you're already here.  You've been here a long time.  So, there's a part of you that knows, even if everything you say is true, none of it matters.
You knew I'd say yes.
Because he is John Doe, by choice.
You know he's fucking us.
Well... what the fuck, man?
If John Doe's head splits open and a U.F.O. flies out, I want you to have expected it.
Throw your gun down now!
Tell me it's not true.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Gould.  I really am.
Anything... anything missing or different.
Are you absolutely certain?
I was close once.  It just didn't happen.
Perfect example.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
Oh, Tracy... I have to tell you, I'm not the one to talk to about this.
Why always like this?  Only after the fact... this sudden realization, that if you shoot someone, or stick a knife in them, that person will cease to exist.
Not tonight...Ben, put that sword back.
Killed every one -- an' not for food either...Why'd they do a thing like that?
You've said that enough!...Maybe Lucy's dead...maybe they're both dead...but if I hear it from you again, I'll fight ya, Mr. Edwards!
Why'd they break off?  Was there water in that canyon?
You can forget that...  Wouldn't be legal anyway.
You askin' as a Reverend or a Captain, Sam?
What good does that do?
What do you know about it?...What's a quarter-breed Cherokee know about the Comanche trick of sleeping with his best pony tied right beside him...You got as much chance of stampedin' their herd as...
You got any more orders, Captain?
I didn't give any order to fire!
Fight fair, son...Use your fists!
I didn't <U>want</U> to tell you...but maybe it's your right to know.
I say NO!
What in...?
Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
If there's anything I can do, sir...
Why Colonel Greenhill is Colonel Greenhill, sir...Commanding Officer, Fifth U.S. Cavalry...I'm Lieutenant Greenhill, sir.
You tell your pa a company of Rangers -- all fourteen of 'em -- fully armed an' equipped will be in the field by daylight...headin' for the south end of the Malapai. If he can catch up with us, well an' good...
Unnt-meah!
Ay-eh...They was here...
Steady, Daniel Boone! You don't want to miss...It makes them think their medicine's stronger than yours...
You help me find her, you got your rockin' chair...
I beg your pardon?
Yes, sir.
All right...but I'm givin' the orders...You take 'em or we split up here and now...
Say!...What happened to your blanket? Lose it?
He's agreed to take you on and share the increase from my herd while I'm gone...I'll be pushin' on tomorrow...
Why?
She's your nothin'...She's no kin to you at all!
Not so funny...if you recollect what 'Nawyecka' means...
Futterman?
When are you goin' to learn to keep your mouth shut! Come on. Let's get out of here.
You got yourself a <U>wife</U>, sonny!
That's the way to train 'em. Looks like Mrs. Pauley's goin' to make you a fine beautiful wife...
Least, <U>THEY</U> won't feed any Comanches this winter...Killin' buffalo's as good as killin' Injuns in this country.
Well, you're a widower now...
They'll be back...
What's that got to do with us?
I saw it...And don't try to tell me it was Aunt Martha's or Lucy's...
Comancheros...
I'd be obliged if you'd get to the point, ma'am.
Yes!..Yes, I remember!..Have they found her, Ethan?
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
I'm a woman, Martie...  We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash <U>you</U>....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
I have to cut his windpipe...
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Are you crazy?  That costs a fortune!
Cherry-red Tears.
Don't tell me you've made friends with that wandering flea circus?
Oh, Ellen.  My sweet Ellen... Of course I knew.
I told you, there is no way out. He won't let you go.
It's important - he knows the last chapter.
Oh, Ellen!  I've been wondering when you'd come.  Why don't you step in.
No, I've never seen him before.
And that is?
Mrs. Straub!
What?
Oh…what have I done?
Follow that boat!
Thank you, my lady!
What is money to me like us? Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting, a comedy by Shakespeare.
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
We have no Juliet!
Not from me. I only stole it. When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men?
Are you writing?
How much?
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
No, your marriage bed.
This time we take your boots off!
But nothing is happening.
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
What happened to Sam?
Do you know it?
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
I feel a scene coming on.
Will! Have you finished?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
We are lost.
How will it?
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
Not new--my Doctor Faustus.
Romeo is…Italian. Always in and out of love.
The daughter of his enemy.
As a nurse.
But your voice  Have they dropped?
"…Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?"
I would not for the world!
Like you, I found him not at home!
I like it when they cut heads off. And the daughter mutilated with knives.
No…no.
"…thou need'st not to be gone."
My lady Viola.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
But what of Lord Wessex?
"Poet?"
Squash is often used as a metaphor to represent a struggle for personal domination.
Chess. Chess is often used as well.
Only on expenses.
Alex, I don't have the time --
You mean immoral.
It's asick idea, Alex. It's sick.
No, not that.
You know what I'm talking about.
You know what. Who's going to do it.
I won't be able to.
I don't know.
How much did you pay?
How much?
What is this?
I want to secure it.
Who?
Sex lines? Is that it? Triple X-rated interactive fantasy? Old habits die hard.
Yeah, I'm sorry, but that's the way it is.
I mean, we've had ups and downs, right -- good times, bad times?
It's very kind of you to offer, but --
What?
Out in the woods. Three bodies. Decomposed. Mutilated. Beyond recognition.
Well?
Are you recording it?
Well, is it?
That's right.
Well, Cameron, are you comfortable?
Cameron.
When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
Did you know --
No. Be someone else like him. One is enough. And what happened to that girl, that friend of yours, the one that came round. I liked her. I really felt we had something. She could have moved in. We had chemistry.
Has he tried down the back of the fridge? I mean, that's where I normally find things.
You want me to kick it open?
Who's going to do it?
I don't thinkI can.
Sshh.
Love and happiness for ever.
Hello. Hello.
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
We have to talk.
Exactly. Now I've been thinking --
He isn't safe up there. If you really cared about him, you'd use your influence to get him down, then he'd be safe.
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
Interesting.
So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.
No, nothing, sorry.
Of course.
I've never seen a dead body before.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Two hundred.
Two hundred pounds.
That's what it cost, David.
What do we do here, David?
-- is often sneered at. Are you aware of that?
What guy?
Oh, him. Well, he died.
You must be Hugo.
What do you do?
Working nights?
Same as everyone else.
Diseases.
Both, sir.
Offering it for debate.
Your watch.
You're in a good mood today, George.
Do you think George is a fairy?
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
That's George.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
-- is that what this is all about?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Why not?
I know.
Nummers.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
No, I know.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
Then it's not your problem.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
You here to see my mother?
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
I asked you first.
Yeah, it is.
No shit.
You are.
Oh yes. Mrs. Shumann called about you.
Wonderful woman.
I went to school with her husband.
You do know what money's like these days.
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
Where do you want to do this?
Well, what do you think?
... I don't get it done often.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Why not?
George...
Don't do it.
That sounds like me.
-- what?
What's wrong?
Why?
Look about last night --
-- Right after I sprayed her?
-- You takin' a lot of shit lately, George.
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
-- you shouldn't talk to me like that no matter what, George... you know better...
Jackie Shawn.
Not yet.
I have to see you.
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
You're different.
Honey?
Maybe you don't even like children.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
I already said hello.
George.
When can I talk to you?
When is that?
Never mind. Where've you been?
I know, honey.
Bullshit.
Well that's something.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Didn't you, baby?
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
-- and take this with you.
I wish you'd go now.
Please!... that's not like you.
Stop it.
It's good you want to do something, George.
Tonight?
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
Godammit, George...
Sit down.
I wanna hear about it.
Was it me, did you have something against me?
Did they have something against me?
I wanna hear it from you!
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter.  I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
You're home.
I'm coming over.
No you won't.
I told you I get 'scared up here, so if you're not coming right now...  I'm not kidding.

Well, whatever I am, I think I can get you whatever you'd like.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Who were you talking to?
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
No.
That's right.
I am? I mean why?
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
It's been so long I don't how long?
What?
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
Oh. thank you.
Good for you.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
Thank you.
Everything okay, son?
I think that was farther west in the Sierras.
There were a party of settlers in the covered wagon times.  They got snowbound one winter in the mountains.  They had to resort to cannabilism in order to stay alive.
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
It's like I go to sleep, and he shows me things but when I wake up, I can't remember everything.
Yes.
Not things that anyone can notice, but things that people who shine can see.  Just like they can see things that haven't happened yet. Well, sometimes they can see things that happened a long time ago... I think a lot of things happened right here in this particular hotel - over the years, and not all of them was good.
No I ain't.
Yeah.
I didn't think it was going to be this big, did you?
Can I go to my room and get my fire-engine?
Make sure you come right back, 'cause I'm going to make lunch soon. Okay?
Red Rum.
Danny.  Danny, stop it.  Danny!
Mommy...
Mommy... Mommy...!
Do you remember when you were brushing your teeth?
Please...
But eh what was the matter with him?
Oh I wouldn't think of it.
Grady?
Yes, sir.  I have a wife and eh two daughters, sir.
Who?
How?
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.  Delbert Grady.
Just give me one more chance to prove it, Mr. Grady.  That's all I ask.
I'd be glad to do that, sir.  Oh why don't you call me back in about eh twenty minutes?
Good evening.  Forest Service.
The Torrances are going to take care of the Overlook for us this winter.
Dick, if you're ready to do it now, I think it would be a good idea if you could show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen, while I continue on with Jack.
Beg pardon?
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?
It's really nice up here, isn't it?
and it will then take me time to get back to where I was, understand?
You mean just leave the hotel?
I don't know.
Yes...
Stay away from me!
Stay away from me!  Please...
Stay away from me.
Stay... stay away!
Give me the bat.
I'm gonna go now.
Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May.
Only in a very general way.
...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.
How about your wife and son?  How do you think they'll take to it?
I don't believe they did.
The police eh... they thought that it was what the old-timers used to call cabin-fever, a kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people are
Well, obviously some people can be
Yes, very cosy for a family, and if you feel like spreading out you have the rest of the hotel to move around in.
As a matter of fact we eh... brought a decorator in from Chicago just last year to refurbish this part of the hotel.
If Father Lowe is an innocent little lamb, why hasn't he picked up the telephone and called Constable Haller to tell him Marty's sending poison-pen letters?
Would you kids mind telling me how this guy Lowe became a werewolf to begin with?
Can I tell you kids something?
Did he really get his head cut off, Dad? That's what Brady said.
Went shopping. Why?
Please, Uncle Al.
Are you all right, Marty?
I've been hearing noises in there.
There's a saying- so-and-so was better than a poke in the eye with a sharp stick. You ever hear that one?
What's going on at Owen's, Uncle Al?
Well... I like it that you always know how to say things, Uncle Al.
Don't call me dear boy.
Your mom's not around, is she?
It goes fast, all right- and if your mother finds out just how fast, Marty, I will have a new job. Singing soprano with the Vienna Boys' Choir.
I know you don't. But I want this to be our secret. You get that, don't you?
Stay near the house, for Christ's sake- someone's killing people. I have to be out of my mind to be doing this, you know.
Was it a prescription?
No- we just got you out here so we could admire your pretty face.
Do you really think that a man who took a rocket in the eye three nights ago could be out mowing his lawn? He'd either be in the hospital... or dead.
Well... it's a lot easier to swallow without the hair and the foaming jaws. Also, I checked on the otic solution. It was counter brand. No prescription needed.
It could have been anything, Marty.
I saw what I saw.
I think he's going to come for me. Not just because I know who he is, but because I hurt him. Only I don't think he'll try again as Lowe.
I must tell the Cardinal.  I.11 send him a personal letter, describing your efforts, your bold new fight to keep your little convent alive.
I think I hear it!
You know, I just might!
But I'm fearful!
And I'm tearful!
How are you doing.
Come on -- stay.  Just a little.  We can talk, I'll get a pizza.  Pizza in bed, we'll have fun.  And you still haven't told me what happened.  What did she say?
I want us to be together.  Like people. Honest, decent people.  In the eyes of God.  Babe, today... I went to confession.
What? 
Babe, it's not me!  I love you!  It's God!
I was good to you! You re nothing but no-talent garbage! You're a two-bit Tramp!
This prom is a real drag.
Look at that.  Get a gander.
He's so dreamy.  He's like... a Greek god.  He's the cutest guy here.    He's boss.  He's fab.  He's...
HE'S SO FINE.
To sell, of course.  I hate to say it, but we're in terrible trouble here at St. Katherine's.  We need a new roof, the furnace is going, and there's no money.
Hold on.
Two days.  An hour or so.
All right, I am, I know it!  All my life, I've just been... upbeat. Optimistic.  Perky.  I can't help it. Even when I was little, I remember my mother used to say, "That child is pure sunshine.  She'll either be a nun -- or a stewardess."
What is it, Mary?
Hurry, Sister!
DAMNATION WAS ALL I COULD SEE
Soprano or alto?
We could cut a demo.  Look for a label.
JUST SING!
So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's?
We need experience.
I'm getting experience.
Those people are wonderful!  Why don't we ever see them in church?
Oh my Lord!
I don't want to mess anyone up...
Are you leaving us?
Run!  Take off!
But what do they want?  Where are we going?
BUT THE LORD CAME TO ME
Christy.  Christy Van Cartier.
St. Anne's?
I joined this convent some thirty years ago.  At that time, the world knew some measure of peace.  And hope.  Our order was a beacon of hospitality, to families, to children, to a neighborhood filled with promise.  And, as the years have passed, I have watched that promise destroyed.  Drugs.  Gangs.  Spandex.  And. so I have made this convent an oasis, a retreat from horror. And now that horror has invaded these sacred walls.
And all those like you.
How about a robe?  One of those big terry cloth jobs, with like embroidery on the pocket.  "Guest of St. Katherine's"
Excused.  Open the cabinet to your left. You will find appropriate attire.
No!  No!  I can't do this!
The Mary is in deference to the Holy Mother, the Clarence in honor of Saint Clarence Loyola.  There are three vows that every nun must accept.  The vow of poverty...
Surely you are familiar with this practice, Mary Clarence.  Only when our lips are silent, can our prayers truly be heard.
What's wrong with my life?
Deal with it, sweet thing.  It's important, nowadays.  You just practice at home, with a balloon and a banana.
Sometimes it's not enough!
It never solves anything.
Clearly, you have learned nothing. And you present an ongoing threat, both to this convent and to yourself.
And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
You sent for me?
What?
But -- there's so much more to do right here.  And look, if it's about me, I mean, I'm gone.
You saved my life.
So I don't shop.
He's a businessman.
When are you gonna get off my case? Have you got a search warrant?  What do you want -- cheap thrills?
Right between the eyes!  Down and out! The guy was gone!  I... I couldn't believe it!
And if I don't?
Ten flights?
All right!  I get the picture!  I'll do it!  I'll testify!
Eddie, you've got to get me out of here.
It wasn't my fault!  They just showed up.  It's helping the convent.
Really?  Lieutenant?
You're not... seeing anybody?
I have?
I can't go with you.
They need you?  A bunch of nuns?  For what?  Moral guidance?  Make-up tips?
Jerusalem is a real drag.  Everybody hates me.
Where's who?
We're looking for Mike.
Get her!
I can't see anything in here!
Joey?
Look what she did with the choir.  She made us sing beautifully.
Yes, Mary Patrick?
Peace on Earth.
I'd rather sing than do anything!
Well, I don't care who she is.  We can't sing without her!
But she's been exposed to the underside of life.  She is the underside of life.
But, Bishop...
But, Bishop, surely you realize -- this is a most dangerous neighborhood.
Um... I... I did not... no.  Why?
We must be a curious sight to him.
You need to sleep.
It is sacrilege!
Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must...  Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures.
It is only important what you are. An adulterer...
You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night.
Just a moment...  Are you saying it is he?
Listen to what you say....
Where are we going?
Are you familiar with magnets?
Thank you.
If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves.
My father had farm land.  It was the only thing we owned of any value.
Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing.
I was getting worried.  Who was it?
What was she doing?
There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone.
What now?  Where is she?
She's the one who controlled the Horseman, isn't she, sir?  Sir? 
This is farewell.
What now?
You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you?
He has proposed to me twice.
I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life.
To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black.
You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping?
He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being...
Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust.
You promised justice.
Why would you do such a thing?
I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel.
You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.
What happened to your mother?  Is she still alive?
My God... what has happened?
Ichabod...
Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay?
Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love.
Go home.
She is guilty.
All right then, I'll see y'all later. Karl you done a good day's work. They right about you. Scooter, he's gonna knock you out of a job if you're not careful. I'll see you tomorrow.
Hit ain't got no gas in it.
Hey Jerry, how it's goin'. Good to see you. Been a long time.
Well, I guess it's all good.
... on the third day I washed her. She wasn't very clean. I got all the right spots. She was the first one I ever kept for any length of time, you see I get bored easily, I have a short attention span. I can't say she enjoyed her stay, although the washcloth in her mouth held in place by good duct tape kept any complaints to a minimum. I don't really like people who talk a lot. I like to do the talking. I guess that's why I'm so fond of you. You're so easygoing, although I do sense a little tension in you sometimes. By the way, how was it out there? Did you have any fun? Make any new acquaintances? Tell me what it was like.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Let's go, Vaughan.  Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
Well, I wouldn't let it get to you.
I thought I told everybody to get out of my house. That includes cocksuckers and retards. Get off your asses and go.
Leave.
What in the goddamn hell are you doin'? It's the middle of the night.
What have you got to be nervous about? You're a damn kid. You ain't got any bills to pay or bidness to run or old lady to stay on your ass all the time.
Now here's the deal. Now that I'm gonna throw my entire life away doin' what I want to come live here with y'all, we have to get a few things straight. See, Frank, me and you mama wouldn't have any problems if it wadn't for you. We'd never have a bad word between us. But since you do exist, if I'm gonna be here as the head of the household, we'll have to live by my rules. And my rules are you don't speak unless you're spoken to. Stay out of my way and do what a regular kid does. You're a weird little shit. I don't get you. So wake up. Face what they call reality. We're gonna be a family now. And it's my family. I'll be payin' the bills so you got me. But I ain't your daddy. You just treat me like I am. I'm the boss, okay. And the other thing is your friend Karl has to go. We can't have a normal family with him livin' in the garage and comin' in the bedroom at four in the mornin' with hammers and shit. See?
Are you sure you can drive? You've really had a lot of alcohol.
What's in your bag?
Where's ever'body else? You seen 'em?  I thought I told you to get the hell moved out of here anyway.
Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
But maybe just for awhile --
Why'd you live there?
Do you like to play football?
Aw, come on. You'll like her. She's real nice. She'll give us somethin' if we ask her to. Candy or somethin'.
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch. I hate him.
Where'd you get them flowers?
I'm gettin' tired of readin' for a while.
I was wantin' to ask you somethin'.
Would you go see her with me? I kind of thought I might take her some flowers like that woman done you.
I kind of like you tellin' me what to do and not to do. Just like my daddy. I didn't mind him tellin' me. I hate Doyle to tell me what to do. Mama said the only way to ever get away from him is for him to get away from us. That we can't leave him or he'll try and hurt her.
And then some people you don't like right off. It's funny.  You know why I want you to play ball with me?
So it died when it come out?
A boy or girl?
You threw it in a trash barrel?
That makes me feel real sad. Couldn't you have done somethin', Karl? I would have. I wish I would of had him. He'd be here right now. Livin'.
Bible says the same thing about killin' others, too.
Seems like Doyle's wormed his way back in. Mama said he's stayin' over tonight and he's talkin' about movin' in for good. We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll always be nervous, won't we Karl?
Way to go, Karl. We got a touchdown. That was a good lateral, man. That was just like the Wishbone.
Yeah, I guess.
Maybe you can make more sense out of them than I can. I made you a little old book marker and stuck it in that book on Christmas.
Hey Karl, guess what. Mama said you can stay with us. Out in the garage. Our car won't fit in there anyway. It's real neat.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
You walk fast, don't you?
Flowers is pretty. I've always thought that.
I'm ye oldest boy name Karl.
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used to them lookin' at me, too.
Well, you have to learn. It'll take some time. Don't you know anybody down there to help you out?
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl? You been sittin' there like that all night?
Do they know about you?
I'll be.
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
Thank ye.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up.  They say you're well?
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Yeah.
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
Is that right?  Are you going to be staying here long?
Do you have family here?
Yes sir.
He just got out of the state hospital.
He's free. His time's up. That's the rules. He's been treated and reevaluated. He doesn't show any signs any more.
Yes.
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Will that be cash or charge?
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
And your father? Is he from New York?
What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
Not an easy book.
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
What about for you?
Do me a favor, will you?
Next time, when you want two corned beef sandwiches, say, "Two corned beef sandwiches." When you want two ginger ales, say, "Two ginger ales."
It's simpler, that's what. It makes things go faster.
Are you closed?
Looks like someone forgot a camera.
A photographer ...
I'd like to see your pictures some day.
I've never seen anything like it.
Don't be an ass, Auggie. He's trying to make it up to you, can't you see that?
It's not a long drive. An hour, an hour and a half. We'll be back in time for dinner.
Hey, man, how's it going?
Two, right?
You usually get two.
It doesn't have to be true. It just has to be good.
I'm all ears.
Which means that she spent her last Christmas with you.
You made her happy. And the camera was stolen anyway. It's not as if the person you took it from really owned it.
What do you mean?
Shit. If you can't share your secrets with your friends, what kind of friend are you?
No I'm not. I look like shit. And so do you, Ruby. You look just awful.  What's with the patch, anyway? What'd you do with that old blue marble -- hock it for a bottle of gin?
All right, sugar, what's on your mind?
Help, huh? And I don't suppose this help has anything to do with money, does it?
Our daughter? Is that what you said? Our daughter? I mean, you might have a daughter, but I sure as hell don't. And even if I did -- which I don't -- she wouldn't be our daughter.
Stop it, already. Just stop all this crap right now.  Was that your idea to call her Felicity?
You weren't so lukewarm yourself. At least at first.
A couple of moments, I'll grant you that. A second or two snatched from the jaws of eternity.
Still, you can't just write her off.
Remember that business venture I was telling you about? Well, my tugboat came in. I'm flush.
What's this?
For keeps?
You don't take anything seriously, do you?
I've got to get moving. Terry will bust my chops if I'm late. See you in September, Auggie.
A little. Not much.
Open it.
To look at the dirty magazines. I can see all the naked women I want, and it doesn't cost me a cent.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
Let me give you some useful information, son. There's two dollars and fifty-seven cents in that cash register over there  and considering all the time you've put in casing the joint so far, you won't make but about fifty cents an hour for all your pains. However you slice it, that's a losing proposition.
Five bucks an hour. That's the going rate, isn't it?  It's a quarter past two now. My wife's picking me up at five-thirty, so that'll give you about three hours. If you can't finish today, you can do the rest tomorrow.
Benefits?
I don't mean to be nosy, but I was wondering what happened to your arm.
You named the kid after yourself, huh?
I don't like this. I don't like it one bit.
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
That's all right. If I think of something, I'll send my butler over to tell you.
East Seventy-fourth Street.
Of course. Where else?
I listen on the radio. I can see the games just fine that way.  The world is in your head, remember?
It's strange, though, isn't it? Looking at yourself before you knew who you were.
Is that what you do? Draw pictures?
Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
I'm sorry I messed up. You've been very kind to me ...  But all good things have to come to an end, right?
Absolutely. The world is my oyster.  Whatever that means. 
Not a penny, not a stitch. I'm cool, man. 
Where the hell do you think you're going?
Let's not get too idealistic.
Celebrate? What for?
Hey, hey. Happy birthday. Why didn't you tell me?
Yes, an invitation. I apologize for springing it on you at the last minute, but Mr. Benjamin and I are attending a celebration tonight, and we would be most pleased if you chose to accompany us.  Isn't that right, Mr. Benjamin?
Good thinking.
So you robbed the robbers, and now the robbers are after you.
A lot of good it will do you if the Creeper finds you.
So you lost the job. Is that what you're telling me? He just up and fired you?
No wonder he was angry.
Fuck you, too, you white son-of-a-bitch.
We came here to deliver some clean laundry.
Like it or not, Cyrus, that's my name. Cole. Just like yours.
I don't know.
Why?  If they could never take title.
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare.  Even though it was too large f...
Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog.
You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him?
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
I couldn't say anything.  I just stood there, hating her.
They're not his neighbor, like you are.  He is a husband, a father, he risked his <u>life</u> for <u>their</u> country. The same as you.
Well, what then, sergeant?
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
And replaced it later with the new one.  That's your inference?
Did you say more?
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork.  What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
Greedy.
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful.  At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
Mr. Jurgensen.  Did he offer to <u>buy</u> the seven acres from you?
As my wife testified, we were considering it.
I see.  Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found?  Before your arrest.
Didn't go anywhere else?  No errands, no purchases?  Just straight to the boat.  That's the truth.
I did.  Boy.
You said three minutes.
He's looking down.  And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday.  He's proud of the man you are tonight.  That's what counts.
That's when he fell.
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there.  So he climbs up.  To cut it down.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working.  Same report Milholland heard.  And <u>that</u> makes him get the lantern fast.  Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
Then where's the lantern?  And where's the knife?
Cigarette?
Sheriff, I can't afford not to fish toni...
You wouldn't even see it move.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on <u>defendant's</u> boat?
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with <u>no</u> spare battery, hmmn?
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it <u>possible</u>.  Possible that he struck his head <u>after</u> death. Possible?
Well...
For certain, no.
Can I say something, here?
The sweep is just routine, not even police action.  I'd like to see some sort of...meaningful evidence...
Forget it, doll.  After all, you work here - I work here - and believe you me, it's nice to have you with the organization.
Wanna see my driver's license?
I beg your pardon.
Upsy-daisy.
Pardon me, Mr. Bienstock - can I have my flask back?
You girls have seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials?
- so the one-legged jockey said - 
It's just a little inlay - it doesn't even have to be gold -
We're not?
You're going to bet my money on a dog?
Well, that solves one problem.  We don't have to worry about who to pay first.
Nellie told us about it.
We could've had three weeks in Florida - all expenses paid.  Lying around in the sun - palm trees - frying fish...
Where are we running, Joe?
Shave?  At a time like this?  Those guys got machine guns - they're going to blast our heads off - and you want to shave?
How can they walk on these things? How do they keep their balance?
And it's so drafty.  They must be catching colds all the time.
DAPHNE?
When I was a kid, I used to have a dream - I was locked up in this pastry shop overnight - with all kinds of goodies around - jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts -
What are you doing?
What's going on here?  Daphne - Daphne -
What happened?
Me?  After Sugar?
Yeah - let her soak.  Come on.
I'm a push-over for whom?  What is it? Who's on the phone?
And where's he going to be?
What are you doing with my flowers?
Hi, Jerry.  Everything under control?
But you're not a girl.  You're a guy! And why would a guy want to marry a guy?
You're out of your mind!  How can you get away with this?
Hey - these are real diamonds.
It's just going to break his heart when he finds out I can't marry him.
What are you giving me with the omelette?
Wait a minute - my bracelet.  What happened to my bracelet?
All right. What happened to our bracelet?
OH!
She sings, too.
Are my seams straight?
It's nothing.  I just think us girls should stick together.
And that's one of them.
I don't want her to know we're in cahoots.
I'm not crowding you, am I?
Anything wrong?
Look, Sugar, if you feel you're coming down with something, the best thing is a shot of whiskey.
No - no lights.  We don't want anyone to know we're having a party.
Here you are, Sugar.
Oh, I have some suntan lotion.
What do you think you're doing?
Come on, Sugar - time to change for dinner.
His yacht?
We don't have to run.
No, no, Sugar - wait.  I have a feeling she's going to show up any minute.
No!
I thought I heard voices - and I just had to talk to somebody.  I don't feel like going to sleep.
What for?
Didn't you girls say you went to a conservatory?
It's about the Florida job.
What's wrong with us?
We could pass for that.
Just a moment, miss -  May I?
Let me carry one of the instruments.
You know, I've always been fascinated by show business.
So this year, when George White's Scandals opened, she packed me off to Florida.  Right now she thinks I'm out there on my yacht - deep-sea fishing.
Oh, of course.  which of these instruments do you play?
You must be quite a girl.
My last wife was an acrobatic dancer - you know, sort of a contortionist - she could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes - Zowie! - but Mama broke it up.
Please.  It won't happen again.
Another bridesmaid?
We can have it altered.
It doesn't matter.
Don't I know you two from somewhere?
Anything today?
You're making it up pretty good so far.
What's the job?
The wrong shape?  You looking for hunchbacks or something?
What kind of band is this, anyway?
No, we couldn't!
We got time off for good behavior.
Yes.  I come from a very musical family. My mother is a piano teacher and my father was a conductor.
I wouldn't say that.  Careless, maybe.
Bingo?
That so?
You know - I play tenor sax.
Men!
About the future.  You know - like a husband?  That's why I'm glad we're going to Florida.
Men who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless. Haven't you ever noticed?
Why not?
Thanks, honey.
Wait a minute, Daphne.  You haven't got a bathing suit.
That must be it.
No - the ukulele.  And I sing.
Well, I guess I'd better go -
The most wonderful thing happened -
Three?
Oh - in here.
It's exquisite - like a floating mansion.
What is it?
Look at all that silverware.
Water polo - isn't that terribly dangerous?
Harmless - how?
I don't want to bore you.
Yes - all the money in the world - but what good is it?  Mint sauce or cranberries?
I may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo Brother or one of those French upstairs girls - but could I take another crack at it?
I got a funny sensation in my toes - like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame.
How much do I owe the Milk Fund so far?
Really?
A merger?  How long will you be gone?
Oh - that kind of a merger.  Is she young? Pretty?
Real diamonds.  They must be worth their weight in gold.  Are you always this generous?
Do yourself a favor - go back where the millionaires are - the sweet end of the lollipop - not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste -
Good evening, sir.
Scotch coffee, Canadian coffee, sour-mash coffee...
Better bring the check now - in case the joint gets raided.
You'll like it there.  I'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats - striped!
I heard you opera-lovers were having a little rally - so I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing.
Yeah.  You never know who's going to be next.  Okay, Spats.  Report to the Sergeant- at-Arms.
Did Kat tell you she dumped you because of your funky breath?
Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
God, Kat! Please. Don’t be nice to me. I can take anything right now but you being nice to me.
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
You know all that “if these walls could talk” stuff? Do you believe it? That a place has a memory?
Say something. Please.
Where’s Nick sleeping?
What’s going on with you two?
Before Tony, you and your sister were best friends. I couldn’t split you up. If your sister ate the spinach, you ate the spinach. If you threw up--.
You heading to the train station?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Hey, you!
I’m sorry?
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
Six thousand, right?
Who are they?
Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
Would you grab my shampoo?
Yes.
Subtle?
Is this for last night?
I’m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
Fourteen and he’s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
You’re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
Hi.
Oh, no. He told you.
The one I made for you is the cherries. You hang onto it or give it back?
So why’d you let him go?
“Not yet...”
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
Best thing about being a dad is when your kid starts kicking your ass--
Hey, Sigmund, you think you could rustle up the bride and tell her to join the party?
I don't know, he's in a prison camp.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
You got a pretty house, Miss Johnson!
Don't you teach in your school 'bout folk who ain't dead?
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Go on...
:...HEARTS. AND TO THEMSELVES IN THESE DAYS THAT TRY THEIR SOULS...
:...FINER SPIRITS BOON AND GUERDON FOR WHAT THEY LOSE ON EARTH BY BEING BLACK.
But, Charlie --
There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
What's wrong with your leg, Daddy?
Son, that was some trip you went on...
And me too, son! You shore done got to be such a big little man!
You bet we is!
Mornin', son...
Dear David, if you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes. The school term will begin September 8th, but it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month. I do hope everything is fine and you will be here. Give my "hello" to your family. Yours truly, Miss Camille Johnson...
David, you never cease to amaze me at how good you are in taking care of my garden.
Miss Boatwright --
Mama, there's hot meat on the stove!
Who's winning, Mama?
What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
'Bye, Mama...
What is it, David Lee?
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
Can I go day after tomorrow?
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
I cut it on some glass and we got lost, Mama.
Didn't see 'im, Mama. The other men there say they didn't know Daddy.
What's wrong with him, David?
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
We brought your laundry, Miss Boatwright.
Come, I'll take you home.
Don't pout now, David, it's a long trip.
Is he gon' be gone long?
That's one dollar an' twenty cents.
I hope it ain't a lot,'cause I can't give you no more credit till the croppin' season gits back, that is if Na--
Whatcha wanta order?
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
You ready to eat?
I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
I wish I could, Rebecca, but I can't let you.
Shore thing -- next week sometime, and as soon as I git the day, I'll ride out and let you know 'bout it.
BECAUSE IT'S EVIL!!
Good. Now 'Pillow'.
OW!! That HURT GOD DAMMI-
Eric! Did you just say the "F" word?
-no Cheesy Poofs.
Oh, son of a bitch!  AAGHGH!! I mean, son of a biscuit!
Dude, this is seriously lame. I didn't know we were gonna get all dirty and stuff.
Dude, how can you hate the environment?
I can't believe he's dead.
You know, me and Stan were just talking about what a fat fucking hunk o' fat fuck you are.
You're late, Cartman!
Your behind?
Mom...
Eric?! Eric, what is it?!
Oh you poor dear. You've been through so much...
You've got a stupid accent too.
So you see, the point and the theme of the film is kept intact. And of course, the MPAA didn't cut out any of the graphic violence. What did you think?
Thank God, that sucked ass.
What's going on, Chef?
Viva la Resistance.
Purpre mama!
You stay up here in the attic, Ike. Don't make any noises or nothing, okay?
Hey, relax Satan. Don't get all worked up. You're gonna give yourself an ulcer again.
Who is it?
Guess.
SHIT!
That's gonna take a long time!
That was sweet!
Now remember, don't tell anybody we saw the Terrance and Phillip movie!
Dude, our moms arrested Terrance and Phillip!
Dude, let's help Terrance and Phillip!!
Whoa!  What the hell was that?!
"Found Eight Million Pages With the Word Clitoris"!
Dude, do you know what you're doing?
I thought you had something planned.
Oh dear God...
Oh Lord, what have we done...?
My fellow Americans. I have led this fight in the War against profanity. I have founded Mothers Against Canada.  Our neighbor to the north has abused us for the last time.
Ma'am, we're tracking a resistance... It's probably Canadian spies!!
I am the dark master!
SILENCE!  I AM SATAN!
Terrance and Phillip are two VERY untalented, unfunny actors from Canada. Their TV show is filled with toilet humor and bad language and is just complete garbage.  Now it appears they have a movie and I'm positive it's not suitable for children!
What do you mean MOST, why not ALL?
Mrs. Brovlofski, the V-chip hasn't been fully tested yet, it could be dangerous.
What?! Why would you call me a pigfucker?!
It's from your mother.
You'd fuck your uncle!
Fight the power!
The problem is you don't allow your children to think for themselves. You try to raise them in a protective bubble, and then when they finally get old enough, they realize they've been lied to, and they resent you for it.
Oh, you are such a maroon!
Oh, Phillip.  This cannot be good.
Phillip, this is worse than that trip to Quebec City when I fell asleep in that disco.
Sometimes I just think you don't have any respect for me.
Yeah!  YEAH!!!  Man I'm getting so HOT!!!
That's because I wanted to fuck you, dumbass! Now hows aboot you get those pants down!
What if I just left?
Didn't you think it was funny, Wendy?
Hi Wendy.
NAZIS!!
Nothing, Stan. You wouldn't understand.
Check.
Oh my God, what is he doing?
Evening.
Well a little business too.  In my upcoming project Star Trackers I play a ship's captain, and I really wanted to get a feel for the outer space experience.  I feel it will add more credibility to my performance.
So...
No, I think hygiene is important. It helps you get into the part.
Weren't you down in the dining room?
No, I just ran it!  Why are you running it again?
You're certain of that?
Well, everything's running smoother than a baby's ass.
You want to go back to shuttle work?
No.  I'm all set.  Thanks.
The bridge is fine, Taylor, how are things down there?
Now do you want the good news first or the bad news?
Uh, that's an affirmative, Roger Wilco.  Please proceed.
I don't know what you're talking about!
Is that clear?
Good.  Now you'll hear from me when I have the new coordinates. In the meantime don't bug me.
Look at this...Jesus.
No.  But it buys a lot of other things.
Well...I don't mind.  I can put up with it.  I'm taking six months off after this, and I won't have to deal with people snapping their fingers at me.
We're going to die.
Oh right, right you're on that research grant.
Ryan Taylor, first mate.  Welcome aboard.  First time in space?
And suppose you couldn't hold out?
He certainly is polite.
Be careful, you don't want to puncture the suit.
Explosive?
Do you want some advice?
Dawn!  Dawn!
Take this flare.
And what are you going to do?!
He's out of the equation.  Talk to me.
What the hell are you doing?
What do you mean?  What happened!
So close...
In that case, I accept.
No, just enjoying the view.
So I've been told.
Where's Taylor?
How is it going to be different from this?  Go see some boring footprint under glass?
Well now what are we gonna do!
You're Delbert Miles!  You have more clout than some whacked out pilot!  Talk to him!
I need you to actually do something for me.  I need to access your CPU, directly.
Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
How is it looking, Mac?
Ah, come on, lemme see your ball.
I hate fuckin' opera.
You got an 8-track tape player on purpose, just 'cause you knew the only thing they had on 8-track was fuckin' opera.
She told us you went after Junior to save your old man's hide. You got some balls goin' after that psycho.
The Faz sure took care a her.  Breeze makes a nasal GRUNT as he tries to suppress a snigger. Sid - trying to keep a straight face - elbows him. Sid and Breeze approach the coffin. Breeze pulls an orange whip out of a paper bag and carefully places it on the coffin lid.
What's on your mind, Miles?
And look at that; both partners go down together. Kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. He goes over and puts his arm around Buzz.
Miles, I've always been on the square with you.
I got suspended when I was young, too. I was pretty cocky in my day.
What do you think I can do?
Where'd you get this ball?
What the fuck is this?
What makes you so sure it was me? She coulda had lotsa bowlers! Theo rushes Buzz and grabs his arm. The two men struggle for the pin.
The whole world thinks you're underground.
It could just as easily have been me in that box.
What about bowling?
You give Ed Klein of the American Bowling Congress a call.  Tell him your Maynard's boy. He's expecting you, and he owes me. He'll getcha back in like Flynn.  Don't say I never gave you nothing.
Oh sure. Let everyone in. From now on I leave the door wide open. Let the parade begin!
He's the guy Buzz.
It's not so bad. When I'm alone, it feels like someone else. Sheila grabs the bottle from Junior, opens it and pours some on her shish kebab. She leans over and whispers furiously to her father.
Junior's a problem child. He has a thing about -
I have someone for you to play with Junior.
Hey, enough fun and games. We have work to do. Come on Junior. Kastle heads for his car. Junior gets up and follows. The two sleazeballs tarry as Theo stands.
Buzz has been moving the cash out in hollow bowling pins. Sid and Breeze throw sideways glances at each other.
So you're Buzz's boy. I've been expecting you. You hurt my feelings when you didn't come and see me sooner.
Rac. R-A-C. Renovate, Automate, Computerize. That, my boy, is the future. One of the monitors shows a little girl bowling. Her ball moves so slowly it barely tips over the first pin. Kastle hits a key and the pins explode in an emphatic strike. The little girl jumps with joy.
Where's Junior?
After we eat, Dad.
Don't go near the bowling alley.
I get them while they're young. Builds loyalty.
Hole in one! You're the queen of stroke!
Whoa.
You and your sideburns are the talk of the party, Theo.
Can I ask you something personal?
Do you have a girlfriend?
So this brother of yours is hazardous to the health of your dates?
Unfortunately what he wants is you.
Do I want you?
I wanted to be a motocross champion. My folks didn't really care what I did. Then Junior blew a fuse and I became their last hope. Most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, I got bowling. I never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. I hope I'm not insulting you.
So you're hoping Buzz can get you re- instated?
What's plan B?
Oh really? Nothing? My dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.
Come on Theo, what about plan C?
Do you talk with your mom?
Come on, bargain with me.
You professional men drive a hard bargain. I'm afraid I only have five on me. Sheila pulls out a 5 dollar bill.
I'm sure you wouldn't care if he needed your help, right?
You know how people with broken bones know when there's a storm coming?
No, but something's gonna blow in this town. I can feel it.
I can't tell you, Theo.
I saw your eyes when you hit that guy with your ball on TV. THUNDER rumbles. Theo takes Sheila by the shoulders.
Oh great! He tried to kill me! You knew he would go off if he thought I fooled around with you.
If Junior finds us, he'll kill us both.
You drag that coconut around for your health, or do you know how to use it?
You guys got something going on downstairs?
Aagh! Stop! Those are my bowling fingers!
Very good, busyboy.
You faked my dad's murder. You used him! Where is he! Theo chases Sid and Breeze around their car. He catches Sid and grabs the middle fingers on his right hand. Sid howls.
Captain, open the hatch door, please ... the hatch door, Captain.  Open it, please.
Let me out, Captain.  Open the door!
Get out of there!
How big is this spacecraft?
In basic English, what does all this mean?
It sends 200 volts throughout the cylinder surface.  But we've never used it underwater before.
Thirty yards.
Don't pull it, Norman.  It'll start a <u>fire</u> we can't stop.  Norman?
Don't do it!
Well, thanks for the opportuninty here -- my wife appreciates it.
A thousand?  An airplane crashes into a thousand feet of water -- I don't want to sound pessimistic here, but I assume there are no survivors.
What is it?  A military spacecraft? Like a shuttle or satellite?
Coral grows at a rate of two and a half centimeters a year --
The one you recommended.  In the ULF report you wrote for the Bush administration.
Your report's become our bible down here, Dr. Johnson.  We've been carrying out each of your recommendations -- one by one -- to the smallest detail.
At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
What for?
You think he killed Edmunds?
Yes, sir.  I'm here.
It's not sucking, sir.
What caused it?
Get him out of there.  I thought I told you people --
Nothing, sir.
Edmunds, get in here.  I need you for this.
No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely.
So how do we get it open?
Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman.
It's a single sequence repeated over and over.
... spiralling out of the center, you see: "G" is one, "B" is two, "H" is three, and so on... when I got the message.
What?
Some sort of lead or something.
What's wrong?
Time travel.  I always thought it was one of those myths... like Santa's reindeer.
They switched us over.
From the sphere?
What is that?
Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood?
What do you expect?  For them to bring it up here?
Where'd this come from?
Yeah, it was awful.
Me?  Well, I was wrapped in seaweed. It itched for a while, but I survived.  Beth, do you find it... curious that we're seeing all this life down here.  Nothing, and then these enormous flocks of squid.  Then jellyfish?
Wait a minute.
You knew about the squid not being normal.  Before Fletcher went out there?
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN."
You said something to him, didn't you?
It's not worth the risk.
You fixed my suit?
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you.  You see it?
... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship.
None of this was here before.
No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it.  You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it.
He translated it wrong.
He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things.
I don't know.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Diphenyl parlene.
Tranquilizer.  Causes drowsiness.
Damn it!  Chloramphenicol?
What's that?
What was that?  I couldn't hear you.
It's getting cold.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
How do you feel about snakes?
What are they doing down here?  In the bathroom?  Suddenly appearing.
Did you?
Against what?  Harry's unconscious. He's not a threat.
You're lying --
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else.  You want to blame Beth.  Because you hate Beth.
Beth!
Beth, stop it!
Beth?
Don't tell me about me.  I already know too much.
You hear that?
How's that?
He doesn't wait for an answer.
Pry the thing open?  What are we -- neanderthals?
Yes you did.  Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there.  You know that.
I'm sorry.  Slip of the tongue.
Just in time, too.
When did it come across?
How are you feeling, Norman?
C'mon, Norman.
Nice work, Norman.
I can't believe that, Harry.
I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong.
Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish.  Harry, what happened in the cafeteria?
Norman, where are you?
Beth left?
What is it?
Fine.
Missed.
Hold on.
Well, press something!
There is one possibility.
The power allows us to manifest our fears, right?  What if we feared the power to go away?
Well, if it's a discharge --
Don't gimme that psychology bullshit, Norman.  Psychology isn't a science, it's superstition.  It's a bunch of soft, subjective theories without any hard data to back it up. With an intellect like this, emotions don't mean shit.
Norman Johnson.
By the way sir, I've read your report.  I think it's brilliant.
You mean they haven't told you yet?
It's not some fucking substitution code, it's a direct visual representation.
Jerry isn't hostile, Norman.  He said earlier -- we were his friends --
There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline?
I think there are some things we should talk about.
I... I'm not a Bendu Officer.  I'm not even a startrooper.
You saw through me?
I'm afraid I've gotten too old for this sort of thing.
Luke, I'm coming along to do what I can, but I'm tired and I'm depending on you to get us through.
When a creature dies, the force it generated remains.  The Force is all around us.  It can be collected and transmitted through the use of a Kiber crystal.  It's the only way to amplify the power of the Force within you.
Are you all right?
I can't do it.  I'll get hit.
See, once you let yourself go you can do it.  You'll get it.
Of course, where you been kid?
That's no battle, kid... They're just sitting there!
Should we alert the Sith Lords?
When Artoo has been safely delivered to my forces, you get your reward. You have my guarantee.
The plans and specifications to a battle station with enough fire power to destroy an entire system... Our only hope in destroying it is to find its weakness, which we will determine from the data I stored in Artoo.
We must hurry to the base.  We have little time before the Death Star arrives.
Organa Major is a rebel system. There will be quite a few starfleet patrols between here and there... It could be a little tricky if you want to avoid them... ten thousand.
No, it's impossible... No one, and I mean no one would venture anywhere near the Alderaan system... I'm a free booter, not revolutionary.  You're aboard the wrong ship, son!
Something has happened to them. Let's try this way...
Is he afraid of the water?
I don't pick up any life form concentration down there.  She'd better be right.
I noticed you were having some problems, Blue Five... I thought I'd help.
The... ah door's jammed.  Give us a few minutes to get it fixed.
I said we'd see.  And as it is, I was forced to borrow your academy savings to buy the new 'droids.'  When you've saved it up again, I'll let you go.
That's all right.  There is nothing anyone can do about it.  You can call me Luke.
Level five, Detention block A-23, cell 2187.  She's still alive...
You rich kids... are all the same !
Our love will grow, dear, year by year...
Whad'ya talkin  about ?
No, this hurts.
Mobile Infantery rules !
Rico, did you give the recruit permission to remove his helmet ?
Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
I've been thinking about applying for Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.
Eight point... no, uh, seven...
All I know is Carmen's going to be a citizen, and I don't think it'll work out for us if I'm not.
Hope you're ready for more. We're going back to P to capture that Brain.
Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?
Profile's wrong... there.
She got a command... and she thinks we oughta team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we're good together.
Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?
Fleet encourages marriages among flight officers. You'd probably get a promotion out of it.
I'm not kidding. Marriage is -
Carmen...?
No, I... Oh, Zander, I'm a fool.
She's flying starships !
Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
35% on the math final !  No one could be that dumb with numbers.
None at all... We won.
Everyone's looking... we shouldn't...
I love you, Carmen.
You're late.
Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big K.
Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.
Where'd it come from ?
Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?
You still gonna play for Brazil ?
What's your malfunction, Rico ?
Why did you go and do that ? He was all ready to go Zegema Beach !
...CUT OFF !
Don't talk like that. Get yourself home as fast as you can.
This came for you today. I presume on your request.
Have you lost you lost your mind ? I'd rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.
I'm eighteen. It's my decision.
You'll resign, and that's all there is to it. It might look bad, but if that's the worst you suffer...
Well, it's just good to hear from you. What's up, son ?
We must be right over the colony. Let's get some air support, eh ?
I don't understand it, Lieutenant. It's not getting anything from 4th Brigade... not even their transponder.
Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico, I'm making you sqaud leader !
Is that your signature, Rico ?
No talking please. I'm going to ask you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We'll know if you don't. Birthplace ?
Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright little face...
I don't know what they teach at Harvard, but I think I'm pretty good enough the way I am !
Hello... Oh, Johnny...!
Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing fire...!  I'll take the first group.
Can you walk ?
How bad are you, pal ?
The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
I just wanted to say thanks 'cause History and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.
Where'd you learn to do that, soldier ?
What's that look like to you, Rico ?
Rico, tell'em to glass this goddam planet. I've never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time...
You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator.
A machine...! Then it had to be programmed. By <U>whom</U>...?
As I stated, V'ger calls to the Creator.
And when V'ger melds? What will happen to you?
Mr. Chekov, when do those devices activate?
Tractor beam strength lessening, Captain.
That's why you're staying aboard. I'm sorry, Will.
Stop competing with me, Decker!
That's precisely the point, Captain. We don't know it will do. Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble.
<U>Computer off</U>!
Well, Mr. Decker, it seems my bluff is being called.
We could have cut it off at the main computer...
Then V'ger believes the Creator to be a <U>machine</U> too.
I now the Captain meant no person- al insult.
Navigational deflectors inoperative...!  Directional control also inoperative, Captain...!
Was he difficult?
Mr. Spock?
Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud.
They have... they <U>have</U> been communicating with us. I sense ... <U>puzzlement</U>. Why have we not replied?
It appears that our message has been understood, Captain.
They had a pattern to follow...
Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images...
If this is their ship's data banks, where is the crew? Or is their entire ship automated?
Were you right? Spock? V'ger is a living machine...?
Captain, the orbital device will      not be triggered for twenty-two       minutes...                           
V'ger plans to literally <U>meld</U> to reduce both itself and the Creator to patterns...
There's no way to know. V'ger expected it to be a machine -- some single entity.  All of us here may be reduced into patterns...
Why aren't you on board?
Then you'll be wet.
He have any special dietary requirements...?
Northern Books.  What can I do for you?
I want to rent this one.
I quit.
Why?
You get what you pay for.
But, but but but...
Of course, of course that's what I'm <u>saying</u>.  As the Old Mill goes around, he <u>sees</u>...
Goodbye.
Really.  With the porch swing and everything...
...that's what the swing is <u>there</u> for...thats its <u>purpose</u>, <u>isn't</u> it...
They decided, I decided to, to...You love what?
This is, look:  Go you Huskies.  ...what <u>I</u> see you saying, is:  you have the two elements, Fire and <u>Water</u>.  The Firehouse, and the <u>Old Mill</u>...Do you know, you could...
Me?
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
...lost the screw...
Me, too.  You have a paperclip?
Hi.
Thank you.
Start?  This isn't a good time.
You used to go out with him, you broke up with him?
Good morning to <u>you</u>...whatsa matter?
What's the scene...
That's right...
Where you going?
Going home, yeah.  I told them what you said...
No, that's true.
Pelting down out there.
What am I gonna do?
I can't do that.  If I tell them, they'll, if I <u>tell</u> them, they'll try Bob for rape, they'll...it'll ruin his career...
Drama Group?
Waal, <u>there</u> you are, and Have I Got Some News for <u>You</u>...
What, what what are you doing here?
Ten thousand dollars.
We did...?
Yes, Maude, it is.  It is a <u>very</u> good play.
Mornin', Doc...
They're holding it for ransom.
What's an Associate Producer credit?
It'll hurt the box office.
He's on the ph...
Wat...
Marty, it's Howie Gold on the coast, he needs your confirmation on a request for money...?
<u>This</u> is your movie, this is small town America.
...why am I here...?
Waterford, Vermont.
How big is this horse?
They think it's your First Wife...
Mornin, sister.
Well, I can offer you something to drink?
...wouldn't that be dangerous?
She's a <u>waitress</u>.
We're going to discuss the scr...you wanna come along...?
It's a formality.  Any case of damage to city prop...you hit the control box of the new stop light, and...  They'll, uh, these things <u>happen</u>, I hope you're alright, and that you're feeling...
Izzat so?
What's his name?
No.
I want to tell you something, Wally, he's a pussycat.  <u>My</u> thing is to see everybody does what they said they would and I have to do that.  Now:  what is this you want <u>Eight Hundred Thousand Dollars</u> to do what you're being paid to, you already <u>signed</u> you'd do...?  What is that?
Get him on the phone.
That's my...
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
I know that, Claire.  I, we <u>all</u> know...
...I can't do it, Wally...
Claire:  As an interpretive artist to a creative artist:  Stay with me.  I need you.  We start to shoot tomorrow and then it belongs to <u>us</u>.  Stay.  Stay.  Tonight...when...  When they've gone.  Let's talk.  Let's <u>really</u> talk.  We could, we'll have <u>dinner</u>, we'll...a bottle of some bad red wine, we'll get spaghetti, and we'll...
Hello.
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't <u>tell</u> you...
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
"Bring it in on time and there's more where these came from.  Marty.  P.S. I want to talk to you about a product tie- in..."
Somebody make a note.  I want Li..., for the broad...what does she like?  Lilacs. Okay.  A truck of lilacs when the broad comes.  And get something for Bob Barrenger, get him, what does he like...?
You show Claire these sketches?
Kiss my ass.
Aren't you supposed to set an example for people...?
Conspiracy in Statutory Rape?  Okay.  Of whom?
Well you guess what.  The Mayor sent me. I have your Mr. Barrenger with a history of...
And I've got a witness!  Your Mr. White saw the crime.
He didn't have to tell...
And what was it you wanted to say?
You know, the rape, to...even to the accident...
What?
He saw the accident...?
I'm very sorry I...
Not now.
I'm trying, honey...I'm...look, is your Ma, when is your <u>Mom</u> coming?  Oh.  What did the <u>midwife</u>...?
My <u>wife's having a baby</u>...
Halo?  <u>Marty</u>?  What would they have used instead of an old mill?  We need it tonight.  Marty?  Yeah you were saying...?
Grace...
I want to make a good film.
And maybe it will be a better movie without the old mill, I...
What's the...
I've got a date.
I treated you like a son or nephew.
...that's just so <u>narrow</u>...
<u>Siddown</u>!
You can't write it?
She doesn't show her tits!!!  She doesn't show her tits.  The breasts symbolize motherhood, the audience...
How do they know that, you told them?
It's lovely.
You cool the broad out?
Oh yeah, I'm really gonna eat carbohydrates...
<u>Stop</u>...
Well, I've enjoyed it, too.  Any... any...<u>any</u> time...  What does the woman want from life...?
He just saved us eight hundred thousand bucks.
Mmm.
Waal, then, invite someone <u>else</u>, then...
My golly, you know?  All my life I grew up in the city, but every summer...would you like a cigar?
Well, these things happen.  <u>Purpose</u> of my call, my wife wanted to know what brand of <u>cigarettes</u> Mr. Barrenger smokes, so she could lay some out tonight...we got the list of his dietary <u>requirements</u>...
Zat true?
&quot;Those who travel far and near this will make you DISAPPEAR!&quot;
Ben!  What's wrong?
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
Well, not exactly s...
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
I hope it's the right kind.
Actually.  She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
We make mistakes.  And we forgive each other.  Because we love each other, very m...
I said...
I know.  I know how rough life can be. And how unfair.  So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk <u>straight</u> <u>up</u> to that little jerk...
Thank God.  I got to see you. Grown up.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay?  Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
Don't be.  I'm going.  Where we all go.  Now how can that be bad.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom.  You don't need another one.  But when you're at this house --
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Hold lunch!
What if he's kidnapped?
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm <u>way</u> too young.  It's just for play.
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother.  So why don't you say hello.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad.  And then I <u>will</u> be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
Great.  Big ears, too?
You do NOT run out on your moth...
Oh my God.  That is so not funny.  You're late.  You're really late.  Now get out here and have some cereal.
...EGGzactly.  I'm putting on my coat --  We are late.  We are seriously late.  Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
&quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
...for Christmas, okay?  Every magician needs a white dove, a <u>real</u> one, they <u>do</u>!
Queen of diamonds.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you.  And meatballs.  And you know what?
Mommy's sick, guys.
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds.  Hers was very bad.
Okay.  These are good.
You're making a <u>career</u> decision here, I would <u>strongly</u> sugg...
You can't <u>do</u> that, I won't <u>let</u> you!
Called him.  We set an ap...
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war.  But I'm doing this for <u>their</u> well-being.
You know the kids aren't really in danger.  This is about Rachel, and you're right, I'm disappointed in her learning curve, and...
I'm afraid she's going to walk.
Still, please.
You're still going to have to be dealing with me -- with us.  We should tell them together.
She's a charmer, you'll see.  In fifty years, the kids'll love her ten percent as much as they love you.
How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
We don't have any coffee.
What did you do?
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
Get out!
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
I need practice.
However many.  It's not enough.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis.
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
I don't know wh...
You bet you are.
And cigarettes.  I smoke, too.
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit.  They don't actually <u>go</u> to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
Can I look at the pictures?
It's just not the right time t...
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
It's the same choice you made.
Looks nice enough to m...
Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'?
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's <u>happiness</u> has been wrapped up in <u>you</u>, every moment...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
Just a babysitter -- I mean...you're working...
But?  But what?
Really?  Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Not yet.
It's forever you know.
Everything's gonna work out.  The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
She called it a fight.  <u>The</u> fight.
Something came up.  C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
Hey.
There's something I need to talk about with you.
Hey, Scooby! How's it going?
Ahh...tell me. What do you want to do for me? What's your idea?
Wow.  Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
Hmmm.  But, Consuelo, even though your poor, don't you have any hobbies or interests or anything?
But like, what do you like to do when you're not working?
But when you're not. Like now. What do you like to do?
Consuelo. Are you crying?
Consuelo, I'm sorry, but you know if you don't speak English I can't understand you.
Who is Jesus?
I'm not making fun. I'm showing it as it really is.
I was looking through Scooby's SATs practice books this afternoon and I took one of the practice tests. Guess what score I got?
Sure!...
What are you going to do?
We did the same thing last year also.
I can read it to you.
Well, actually, it's the same, but longer. I think it's better. More...raw.
What do you want?
What the fuck are you talking about? What's OK?
But what kind of pull did you have?
I think Scooby's like a lot of kids. He just hit a…a speed bump. Now he's gonna find his way, his path is gonna be cleared, and I think he's gonna continue his education at a good college. And everybody else is gonna be happy.
What DO you know?
Whaddya wanna talk about?
I just want to know what the hell he's doing in his room that's so interesting he doesn't come down for dinner.
Yeah, uh, listen. Why don't you go upstairs and keep your Mom and Brady company for a bit? I need to speak alone with Consuelo for a moment.
Hello, Vi.
Aren't you going out with Catherine?  I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Fuck me hard!
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
Great!
That's too bad.
Yeah. But not any more.
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
I Know. I'm sorry. I'm just...a little nervous, I don't know why.
You know...I like you.
Does that include Helen Filmore, United States congresswoman?
Uh-oh!  Do you know if the demands are being taken seriously at this point, or does Washington think these people are just a bunch of crazy fuckers playing games?
I'll lead.
Anything else?  Maybe a sandwich?
Let's move it we got company!
He's a very stubborn man sometimes...
What do you mean?
I drew my gun, ran in the direction of the cries...violating the first rule of service...I let the Ambass- ador out of my sight.
Well Filmore--
Are the labs in operation?
Go fuck yourself...
Come on, drink up.
I insist...
Well?
Why the hell didn't you tell us this was at stake!
And what exactly do they intend to do?
What do they have in there that's so valuable?  A cure for AIDS, a cure for cancer?
Something tells me you don't want to be on TV, friend.
KZ...7-0...7-0...nine.  It checks out.
Where the hell could they have gone!
I want the girl.  I don't care about the rest--but a US congresswoman taken hostage will make for great copy. We'll make headlines all over the world...
Well, there was uh, a little dissent about the amount of the bonus--
Of the separate chemicals--I don't know, uh, offhand--
Can I have a glass of water?
Thank you, Admiral.
Where are you trying to reach him?
If he's not there, try...  87 - 43 - 56.
Mister Ambassador, what on earth possessed your country to build this weapon?
Yes?
Damn you, de Sade!  You know as well as I do that this was the act of a mentally sick man - a single individual, whose crack-up can probably be traced to the strains and tensions caused by your country.
Don't you dare touch me!  What the devil do you think you're doing?
Please, Mister President, I am extremely shy and do not wish to endure this sort of personal humiliation.  Here is the only other camera I have left. 
Major?...Major?  I'm Colonel "Bat" Guano, 701 Battalion.
What happened, Major?  Some kind of private beef between the two of you?
Now look, I'm picking up this ordinary telephone.  See?...Hello?...Hello?... Nuts, the lines must still be disconnected.  The General had us disconnect... 
You've wasted enough of my time, fella.
I'm sorry, sir.  General Schmuck is asleep and he isn't taking calls until eight-thirty.
Go back to sleep, baby.
General Schmuck?
Just a second, sir.  He's got films of the War Room in that thing!
Under the circumstances, General, what would you think they should do?
Combat Operations Center, Major Mandrake speaking.
Youddon't think I'd ask if you recognized my voice unless it was important, do you, Major?
Let me worry about that, Major. I've still got my red line to the Air Command.
No calls from inside out.  No calls from outside in are even answered.  No calls.
No calls at all.  With or without my say-so. My voice can be imitated too, Major.
Are you hard of hearing, Major?
Don't fret about it, Major.  There's nothing anyone can do about it now.  I'm the only one who knows the three-letter code group for the CRM-114.
General Ripper, can I ask another question?
But then why do you want to kill a hundred and sixty million of our people, sir?
But even then, we wouldn't get everything.  I mean some missiles would abort, or they'd miss their targets, or maybe the enemy have some secret bases we don't know about.
But if you just let things alone, we wouldn't lose anyone.
Where, sir?
And I guess they won't until they agree to let us inspect inside their country.
I don't know, sir.  But they're just as anxious to avoid a nuclear war as we are. War just doesn't make sense any more, for anybody.
Go on, Major.
Go on, Major.  You fascinate me.
No, Major, I don't.  They have no regard for human life.  They wouldn't care if they lost their whole country as long as they won.
Major, you're talking like one of them!
Don't be offended, Major.  Our President holds the same views.
I'll tell you what I do think.  If they say they're for disarmament, I say anyone who says they're for disarmament is either a traitor or a damned fool.
I'm afraid so, Mister Presient. Being part of the air-borne alert, each plane is carrying a full load - about fifty megatons apiece.
That's right, sir.  But the planes were at their Positive Control points, ready to turn around when General Ripper issued the final Go-code.
Yes, sir.  The base commander, General Ripper, selected Plan-R?
Well, sir, Plan-R is an emergency plan to be used by lower echelon commanders if higher echelons have been knocked out by a sneak attack.
But he'll hear everything we're saying.  And if he just looks out of that window, he'll see everything we're doing. 
How do you know they were shot down, Buck?
Have you tried the recall again?
Is there any chance a single aircraft can penetrate the entire enemy Air Defense, when its course and target are known?
We should be crossing the coast in about six minutes.
You know what that'll do to our fuel consumption.
He's right.  We wouldn't have started it.
Maximum ECM.
Check.
Roger.
Sorry, King.  My leg's stiff as a board.
No, this looks like the real thing.
Primary arming switch.
Yep, it's the CRM-114 code, all right.
What's your point, Lothar?
Second safety.
Primary bomb is live.
How do you know he's dead?
You sure have to hand it to those guys.
What do you mean?
Wait a minute, Major.  "OPE," that's the recall code.  Where would they get that?
Who's that?
Lothar, can you arm the bombs for impact?
There's no other way, Lothar.  Can you re-arm the bombs for impact?
I thought I'd go along for the ride.
King, would you mind if I keep me hands on the wheel when you take her in?
Thanks, King.  I've always wanted to take one of these big babies in.
Um-hm.
I just walked all the way from Westside to here. I haven't walked that far since junior high. I thought you didn't drink.
We were all riding around and it suddenly hit me what we were doing. We were getting off on the fact that we're in a car teen feet longer than all the rest. And I got out and I just started walking.
Yeah, but, when I was walking, I realized that he's stuck in that limo all the time. He's stuck with his interviews, he's stuck with his autograph, he has to do whatever his manager tells him to do, you know? He's not free. He's just part of the machine, and if you think about it, freedom's all that there really is.
That was really great.
Uh-huh.
Typical male.
Want a beer?  Is Pony coming?
I was doing schrooms and I saw this cloud. It looks excellent on tape. The video is like my head and, and everything, you know, is, like, is like in there that I see. You know? Plus, I'm gonna come down here one night and walk around inside the Circle A with the camera and tape shit.
Any gunshot victims?
Sounds like a bummer.
No, he's not with a girl.
That sounds so great, man. Yes. Yes. Hey, what would you do in the afternoon?
A long, long, long...
Go!
Hey! Whoa, you look like shit. You been home yet?
Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
Sure.
Yeah.
But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
Oh, and guess who showed up.
I know, man.
See, I wasn't making shit up, man.
Fuck her! Come on, let's go.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
They are old, we are young, they are fast, we are fun.
Your his publicist?
So, then, you're, like, available?
Hey, we're just having a conversation.
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
So tell us, man. Party time, trashin' hotel rooms, babes around the clock?
Come on, man. Sh, sh, sh.
I mean, do you have something I could show my manager? I mean, do you have a reel?
Who's going to slow me down? You, you fat pig.
I'd like to.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
Mm.
I'd love to read that.
Can you tell me what happened?
What? What the fuck do you know about the third world? You been there? No? No, well, I have. Fuckers live like sardines in a can over there, you know. Everything stinks. It's true, there's no, you know, law, no order. No nothing. The assholes come over here, they think it's gonna be the same.
Jeff, Jeff, if you want to be alone with Pony, you know, that's, that's fine with us.
I mean, you know, at least I admit that I don't know. I know that things are fucked up beyond belief and I know that I have nothing original to say about any of it, alright? I don't have an answer. I don't have a fucking message.
See ya later.
To women. They're all whores. Let us not forget what Chenowsky said. "The greatest men are the most alone." And without suffering, Jeffery, you will never gain wisdom.
Yeah. Yeah, no, you're right. It's no big deal, you know. Guy probably has his arm around her right now, holding her close, nudging her titty with his elbow, talking about the deep significance of his music, while she looks up at him with her big brown eyes. In a few minutes they'll be back at the Four Seasons. You ever, you ever stayed in one of those places?
Anarchy, my friend. Fuck 'em. You know what I mean?
No, no, say it like this. Fuck 'em!
Oh, no, no, no. This is no big deal, you know? I can come down and, and get you out.
You lied to me.
I don't know.
Jeff! Come up here!
Because maybe if we know each other's names, things wouldn't get like this, My name's Jeff.
Nazeer what?
Sorry. Let's go back to the van right now.
Can I talk here? Let me talk.
This is ridiculous!
Jeff. Jeff.
Come with me.
So what do you wanna do?
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
Oh, yeah?
I've run out of words.
Do your covers and all that shit.
Wow. A gold record, man, that's great. So you're, you're like living the wild life now, huh?
Oh, uh, yeah, we were, but, uh, Sooze, screwed up the tickets.
Really?
Now?
No, you know what? It's not you, man. It's not anybody. It's me. Whoo! Hey.
George can drive us. There's plenty of room in the car. Jeff?
No. No, you see, I don't have to call my wife.
Look, get down off my property.
Look Pakeesa...
I hope you're happy!
Is that your driver?
Oh!
No, she was just sitting there?!
Yeah?
Okay, now, you guys all take care, okay? Oh, man, I feel so good. I feel good 'cause I'm hanging out with you guys, man. You know? I mean, I forgot what it was like to just hang out.
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
Well, uh, there's this benefit for Rwanda we're gonna do. And, uh, you know, my songs, uh, where I get the ideas for them, uh, you know, stuff like that.
Ooh, wow, nice. Personal trainer? Very nice.
Well, I called Erica's beeper. There's just no answer.
You know, man, it's none of your business what I do, okay?
Just one?
I don't, I don't remember. What do I owe you?
Yeah. Yeah. How's the air force, Tim?
Make a move. Greasecake. Towel-head.
Hey, your gonna regret this.
Leave him alone, Tim.
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
What?!
I can't believe your grandparents never come down here.
Another sex dream?
Use the bathroom, because the Port-a Potties on the field are gross.
Oh my G-d, you've been robbed!
Look, you're fat, Diane.  You're fat, fat, fat!  Because you eat, eat, eat!  What?!  She keeps asking because she wants some honesty.
C'mon, Luce, people do it in the movies all the time.
... I don't know.  Probably not.
But, we have to make a smart plan!
-- We practice!  Sorry, Cleo.
I sure do.
If you could be Count Chocula, Frankenberry or Trix the Rabbit, who'd you be?
I know, but that was before.
Madonna.
Shut up.
Oh no...
Yeah?
Really...
You sure you wanna go there?
All of you!
Grandma and Grandpa sent you pictures of a neighbor girl.  They didn't want you to break out and come kidnap me.
I don't hate you.  I need your help.
...and sex dreams where you actually have an orgasm!
I mean it.  I'm in.  This is the closest thing to a goddamn family that I've ever had.  If one of us needs something, we all do.
Of course you didn't.  You didn't know Norma Desmond as a plucky little girl of seventeen, with more courage and wit and heart than ever came together in one youngster.
We're ready with the shot, Mr. deMille.
Roll 'em.
Wait a minute.  This is the woman I love.  What's going on? Who was loaded?
The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links.
It's from hunger.
This is Miss Kramer.
Name dropper.
If I could be of any help...
Let me help you.  Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around.
With a wildly beating heart.
I called your agent.  I called the Screen Writers Guild.  Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number.  There was always somebody with an accent growling at me.  You were not there.  You were not to be spoken to.  They never heard of you.
Just so you don't think I'm a complete swine -- if there's anything in Dark Windows you can use, take it.  It's all yours.
I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself.
What about all those ideas you had?
Psychopaths sell like hotcakes.
I mean this is good dialogue along in here.  It'll play.
Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
What's wrong with you tonight? What is it, Betty?
Betty, there's no use running out on it.  Let's face it, what- ever it is.
Hello, Betty.
Her own movie theatre.
All right.  I'll give you a few more clues.
Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable.
I'm pretty busy, as you can see...
What assistant?
How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages?
This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years.
They will love it every place.  Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed!
I wrote that with my heart.
Who?  I'd have to have somebody I can trust.  When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
What month?
It's getting kind of late --
There sure is.
You'll like it here.
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
It's all taken care of.  It's all paid for.
What's that?
What scene?
I need some money right now.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
You know, to me dressing up was always just putting on my dark blue suit.
The other guests?
Hold me tighter.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
Go away.
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Have one of mine.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
He must be quite a guy.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you?
Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
No, you're not.  Max! Max!
That's between you and yourself, Norma.
You don't care.  do you?  But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought --
You are not dressed properly.
There is the bathroom.  I put in soap and a toothbrush.
Whose room was this?
Why?  Her career?  She got enough out of it.  She's not forgotten. She still gets those fan letters.
You see those offices there, Mr. Gillis? They used to be her dressing room, The whole row.
What's the matter, Max?
Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what.
We've come for the car.
All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about?
Got a title?
Of course, we're always looking for a Betty Hutton.  Do you see it as a Betty Hutton?
What do you think I've been doing? I need three hundred dollars.
You do not deny having killed this man, Miss Desmond?
Well, it's one way to get her down stairs.
Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Paramount studios.
I've discovered a new way into the Phantom Zone.
I said stop, I didn't say run into a brick wall.
What does it mean?
We'll bide our time and keep watch. Young girls just can't keep a secret. If one of them's up to something--we'll find out.
Is he your entertainment for tonight?
A Storm Dragon?
Yes! You own the Coffer of Shadow. Nothing can withstand its power.
Next time, remind me to do this out in the yard.
At last. Ultimate Power.
You're alive! She didn't kill you!
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
You're not afraid are you?
Is this how?
Great! I'II build a house-- right over there, with a veranda looking out to sea. And I'll plant a garden! Papayas, pineapples, bananas, mangoes--- anything'll grow here. And I'II fish in the lagoon, and we can go sailing in a dugout canoe, and---
Because you remind me of all the dumb things I said.
I'm not mad at you.
There's something very dangerous about her. Something evil...
A little.
Oh no, not you again.
Yes, yes I saw the whole thing. How could you be interested in that puny little girl?
You can't put her out of your mind, is that it?
Hey, where you going?
I had to dump the papers in a trashcan. The Danvers have been arrested!
I saw them dragged out of the Administration Building.
I can't help it if men notice me.
I sure wish Superman was around. He wouldn't let any of this go on. Not for one minute.
Superman will return it.
I'm sorry... I didn't know.
I can do that.
I have money to buy more, but I haven't had a chance since...
Keep an eye peeled for Myra. She's out to get you.
Go back, sign in, and climb out the bathroom window. McCloskey's always zonked out: she'll never hear you.
Listen, I know I've been saying you ought party more, but keep your hands off this one, will yak? He's private property. I've been waiting years for him to develop.
You're not gonna stay for the ice cream?
Cheer up, Nigel. It's not the end of the world.
You think you are on top now. Well there is someone coming to challenge you. I saw it in the cards this morning.
You better have a pretty good explanation for this, Selena.
Maybe you'd like to get rid of this Supergirl yourself, Nigel?
You've run out of things to throw, Selena.
What's it like?
Where is inner space?
There is a way.
You're going to take me back?
What's that? Never saw anything like that.
Yes, mustn't stop.
Goodbye...
Yeah? What do you want?
What are you talkin' about?
Not enough vodka in it.
Aha! What'd I tell ya!
Got vodka in it now. Gotta give it a new name. Hey, listen, you thought it up, we'll name it after you. What's your name?
Here I am, honey, and I'm all yours.  Remember when you were Queen of the Prom? All the guys had to wait in line to get a dance.  But now there's only one name on your dance card, sweet thing, and it's --
You look wonderful.
You shouldn't say that, you're the chairman --  ...uh, chairperson...
And three years after the Royal Wedding, the King abdicated.  Isn't that terrible?
That song. I remember one day I came into the music room and you were fooling around at the piano. And I thought -- what am I going to do with all this potato salad?
It isn't only that he's small for his age. how would you like to be the only kid in town without a father?  Look at him, he's stewed to the gills in the middle of the afternoon.
He really was!
Hi, Lois. Morning, Jimmy, you've got mustard on your lapel. Excuse me, Mr. White, I don't mean to interrupt but ---
Uh...excuse me, folks...
Do you really know Superman?
Anyway, the reunion's just the hook for the story. What it's really about is how the typical small town's changed in the last fifteen years. how do you like this a title: Can You Go Home Again ?
You're the best, Lois.
Name?
Ah yes, August Gorman. Have you looked for work this week, Mr. Gorman?
Mr. Gorman, according to our records you have been unemployed for 36 weeks.
You are, I was about to say, no longer eligible.
Actually, it's probably more like $143.80 and one-half cent.  There's always fractions over in a big corporation, but they round it down to the lowest whole number.
You've been a naughty boy haven't you?  C'mon now, admit it, you were kinda naughty.
Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
But y'see, chum, the problem I got is that one country just won't play ball with me.  You know how that can just bug a guy, don't you?
How do you do that?
Always making yourself beautiful for me, aren't you?  So, Gus, can you make Vulcan do what I want it to? You didn't answer me, pal.  Did you hear about that prison riot last week? It seems they were complaining about rats in the cells...
When?
Hey, boss.
Uh...what channel were you watching?
Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
And then shut down the pipe lines.
Lookit, you're getting' what you want all the time. it ain't right that I don't get somethin'! I never get somethin'!
Now...when do I get a taste?
Is this blackmail?
A waste-basket? GUS Those are plans.  Blueprints.
Everything.
Remember, Gus. A machine doesn't want anything except to keep on being a machine. You've got to make sure it can figure out how to beat any opponent.
Hey listen, I didn't know your mama was comin' by...
Through the telephone line terminal, that ain't nothin'.
All right, Kent. I just hope you know what you're doing. If you really think Smallville is your big chance, go for it.
Hey, I'd definitely shoot color on that one, Jimmy. It'd be a crime to just use black and white.
Ross, honey, it's time for your massage...
If you don't mind, we are trying to hold a meeting here!
I can't! It's out of control!
Mr. White, please, it's time for you to draw this month's winning JINGO number.  The prize is an all-expenses trip to South America.
53.
Mr. White, the next number, please?
Mr. White, you be in this shot, handing them their plane tickets.
I don't know who. Whom. I can't trace it.  In the old days it was simple. We kept books, we had ledgers, we could see what was going in and what was paid out. If somebody wanted to rob you, he'd come in with a gun and say 'stick 'em up."  Now they get theses blasted computers to do their dirty work!
I don't kiss.
It could make weather!
You mean...you mean...Vera! Vera! The magnitude of this!!!
He ruined it! That lousy do-gooder, he ruined it.
And now that Superman's out of the Nice Guy business...
Jimmy, how's the -
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Where were you?
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Oh Clark, no!
It's true. It's true.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Hi.
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
"They?"
Lois, someday --
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
But . . ..that's terrible!
What??
A good time! Is that all you care about?!
I like trees.
This way Lex.
No, me, me, me. Thank you.
It has everything.
And she -- the one you have chosen -- she feels as much for you?
And so our scientists constructed, from an irreversible mathematical equation, the Phantom Zone. In it we imprisoned these three arch-villains for all eternity.
The Elders have, of course, thought long and hard about that question.
The one danger we have considered is that the Phantom Zone might - we cannot predict - just might be cracked by a nuclear explosion in space. I cannot say I am glad you asked me that -
Why?
OTIS, your brain defies any known scientific laws in its infinite capacity to deteriorate. Every man has a vulnerable point. Some like you Otis, have more that one. I didn't see Superman's in time. But now through patience, invention and skill, my 	black box is just about ready.
I never did this before . . . I have to tell you.
Too late, Luthor. Too late . . .
What more?
I'm the man they're 	protecting. I'm the President. I'll kneel before you if it will save lives.
There will be no attack? No attempt to overpower the terrorists?
So this is the planet Houston . . .
This "super" man is nothing of the kind. I have discovered his weakness.
He's captured Non!
I feel kind of light-headed . . .
Then prove it. Lois is doing an interview with Superman about his peace mission . . .
Oh, probably just a picture request. I'll take care of it if you want, Lois.
'Are you or are you not part of a plot to weaken our national defense?'
Superman? Has something happened to him?
But Superman isn't an average man.
Would you mind taking a walk with me?
Awesome!
Darling, it's good riddance. Let her go. And while you're at it, fire that Clark Kent. He hasn't been here in days. He hasn't even called.
No, Daddy. Our business is journalism. We can't continue to be so irresponsible . . . or else we'll just lead everyone into a disaster.
But all men like me, Lois. I'm very rich.
Are we going to skip the country, Uncle Lex?
Do you realize what I can create with a single strand of Superman's hair!
Gee, Uncle Lex, I don't think this guy's much of a dancer.
The one Superman wrecked up?
You're spookin' me out, Uncle Lex.
Of course! That's his one vulnerability. The one way he can be stopped.
You think he'll find us.
Destroy Superman!
There's some slice American cheese...and...a half a bottle of club soda, I think.
Ah! The guest of honor at last! And about time, too!
I talked to Ben Hubbard this morning. He'll be more than glad to bring in the crops on shares.
Do you know where you're headed?
I'd like to.
Your bookie?
Hey!
For what? Oh, I've see the way the other half lives. My sister, for instance. it looks terrific, but is that what I really want? Three kids, two cats, and fifteen needlepoint pillows? I'd go bananas after one week. Hell, I need this crazy existence of mine.  Like I need the plague, right? That's what your thinking.
There weren't any wires. I looked.
Oh, what a chance! If I could just  --  get to him.
Listen...thank you.
Oh.
This??
Speaking of feeding things, what about dinner?
Nuts. He made it.
Krypton!
Meteorites!
Tune me in , lady. An explosion such as the one Superman describes would have altered the molecular structure of the Krypton rock.
About Vesuvius. About Superman writhing in the bowels of the volcano.  Ahh, the look on his face when he saw that Kryptonite. When will I see another, y'know? Y'know?
Weak sister.  I still can't figure out why it took so long for you to catch up with us after we all ran out. Y'know?
Don't let me down.
You're not going to hit me?
She knows. Clever, very clever.  And unappreciated. But I'm going to take you away from all this.
You got wax in your ears?
Danger??  Somebody??? Lex  -- where are you going?
My friends, I am not a rash, impulsive person. I'm not given to wild, unsupported 	statements. We must evacuate this planet immediately!
Two.
Got all A's this year. Teacher said he's the best 5th grader in the -
They are primitive, Lara, but they are not animals.
You've been doing some research in the archives.
I don't know what to say.  Look, I -- I just -
Lois, the kickback story...
Who...who...
Oh.  Well, where do we start?
Oh.
It must feel great.
How old are you?
What's the matter, Otis?
And now he lies to me. He has been stealing ladies' purses again.  Haven't you? Haven't you, you miserable petty crook?
They're killing me by inches!  Go ahead! Make me suffer! Milk me dry.
At the San Andreas Fault. Maybe you've heard of it.
Yes.
Ally Jones.
I don't remember the name.  It was near a beach.
What...does it turn to?
I can help you.
Leave us alone, Stephens.  Leave the people of this town alone.  You can't help.
Hi, Nicole.
They just finished supper.
I'll be back around nine.
Are you sure?
Because it's what we have to do.
I've tried to stay out of it.  But it turns out that's not so easy, Sam.  You've gone and got yourself this lawyer.  Mitchell Stephens. You and Risa and Wendell and the Ottos.
That's wrong, Sam.  You know that. We'll be tangled up in this thing for the next five years.  This is never going to go away...
It's not enough.  For hospital bills.  For Nicole.
Does this mean I can't take a shower?
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
I have to.
Because I have to.
I mean, the way they look.  Their hair and clothing...
From what?
Yes.  The old-fashioned way.
What do you mean?
That's right.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
It's clear to me and other people that you have suffered significantly from this event.
You want a cup of tea or something?
I didn't ask if you wanted milk.
What happened to summer?
They work for the people we're trying to sue.  Their job is to try to minimize damages.  Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs.  No good guys or bad guys.  Just our side and their side.
There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole.  Not in a situation like this.
I object to the form of that question.  Note that.
Note my objection.  She said, 'As I'm talking.'
What about Doreen?
What do you mean?
Crafts.
Here we go.
We do.
It should be said that my task is to represent the Walkers only in their anger.  Not their grief.
You think someone else caused the accident?
My usual place.  On the right side. The first seat.
You saw the speedometer?
What do you remember about the accident?
That was great.
Do you like the colour?
Nothing good on your T.V.?
Yes.
Will the police do anything to her?
That sonofabitch owes thousands to the bank and half the businesses in town.  He's about to lose his house and car.
Yeah, well, they probably smoke weed.
But of course...
Boys, this gets nobody nowhere - you're over excited, Steve and -
I still think he's responsible for the smear.
Joe, give my nephew a drink.
You told me that your boy was washed up with Susie Hunsecker, didn't you?
You told him that?
When do these hot-headed boys of yours go on the road?
Listen, Frank, you'd better make sure you're telling me the truth.
You don't know that lunatic yet? Whims - egotistic whims!  Like the gag - when you got him for a friend, you don't need an enemy!  That's what the fight with Bartha was about. "Leo", I says, "Hunsecker froze me out.  So I'm eating humble pie this month - please print me an item."
Friends call me Otis - sometimes Tricky Otis.
I hate J.J. -- but not that much at this moment...
Why do you keep coupling me with Falco?
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
I started to say we're drifting apart.  A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me?  Today I had to call you in!
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
Susie, did you know about this accusation...?
You in a mood, Susie, to run over to Milgrim's later and buy a few new frocks?
Hello, Harry.
Why don't you answer the man, Sidalee?  He's trying to take you off the hook.
What, some cheap, gruesome gags?
I know Steve.  No.
How?
He means that much to you...?
But it's too late.  I got him back the job...
Why do something that would drive them right back into each other's arms?  Not to mention that this time Susie would know who shot the arrow...
Is that a fact?  He's a dilly, ain't he?  By the by, what did he have against this boy?
I thought he would.
Bribing me again?
Who put this item in about the comic?  "If there's a more hilarious funny man around than Herbie Temple at the Palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name.  We were too busy screaming." Does this Temple have a press agent?
And where was his wife?
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
You mean you don't want the extra free gift of a colorful giant map of the world???
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
It's a habit with me.  So now I'm briefed.  So what?
That's your idea of logic?  I tell the Judge I didn't murder the man - the Judge says, "Why not you?"
You watch him, Al, I s...s...stutter!
And it would cost a pretty penny, huh?
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
J.J., if you think -
Listen, when your band was playing at Roseland -
But he could be reporting back to your brother, couldn't he?
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
No!  I'm saying that for your sake you have to make a clean break with your brother!
You going to work all day?
Radical.
I'm right here.  I'm fine.  What's the dog's name?
Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?
Negative.  She is not a mission priority.
Jesus... you were gonna kill that guy!
Whattaya mean, why?  'Cause you can't!
Now remember, you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
That's great!  See, you're getting it.
Excellent.
Killing Dyson might actually prevent the war.
No!
So she's pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.  Drag, huh?
John, get out of the way!!
I know!
I know, but I'm not as strong as I'm supposed to be.  I can't do it.  I'm screwing up the mission.
You broke my arm!
Basically.  The Skynet funding bill is passed.  The system goes on-line August 4th, 1997.  Human decisions are removed from strategic defense.  Skynet begins to learn, at a geometric rate.  It becomes self-aware at 2:14 a.m. eastern time, August 29. In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
Because Skynet knows the Russian counter-strike will remove its enemies here.
It's finally over.
You represent the United States now. We have a moral duty to be just and we have to be seen to be just.
Major, that's not a good argument. If Dr. Furtwängler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. That's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.
Yes, I'm a Jew. But I like to think first I'm a human being.
So, Major, tell me, have you questioned Dr. Furtwängler?
But what... before that turns rotten...  What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
Let Furtwängler go. Please.
I'm kidding, Emmi. What about a record player? You have that, too?
Then why did you conduct at one of their Nuremberg rallies?
How come?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Tough, tough!
Why were they going to arrest you?
So, how did you learn that the Gestapo was out to get you?
You were real close to all of them, to Adolf, to Hermann, to Joseph, to Baldur, and now Albert,  So, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. What was your Party number?
It is now nine o'clock precisely. I do not intend to be kept waiting again.
You won't find it because no such telegram exists.
Then you are wrong.
have no idea what ordinary people thought.
Stop this, please, stop this now!
Okay, Wilhelm, go home now. Go home and think about these past twelve years.
Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist?
Oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before - it was the 19th of April not the 20th.
Major.
Yes, you remember.
Great catch, kid. The boy runs off.
I can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, Helmuth. But I need something in return.
One of your people told me.
But I need documentary proof. You know of anything like that?
Edwin von der Null. Music critic. He gave Furtwängler terrible reviews while he raved about Herbert von Karajan.
And ask him about his private life.
Well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.  Now we can't take every Nazi in this country to trial, although I would like to; it's an impossibility. So we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.
I have your questionnaire here. It says you were never a member of the Nazi Party.
It was Hermann Goering. I was told he just made the maestro his Privy Councillor, no questions asked. Although Dr. Furtwängler stood up to him. And to Dr. Goebbels.
Mission control to Chuck, come in...
Aren't I worth waiting for?
Can you handle it?
Anything else?
I'm going to a movie, kiddo. See ya'.  You and Matt have a good time.
I haven't seen you in here lately, Mr. Miller.
Compared to me she is.  How come you're not at the cash anymore?  They catch ya steal- ing?
But outside, it's living human tissue.  Flesh, skin, hair...blood.  Grown for the cyborgs.
There's so much...
This is gonna make me puke. Talk about something.
Look.  I found it.  Isn't that it?  Cyber Dynamics Corporation?
Whatever...they become the hotshot computer guys so they get the job to build El Computer Grande...Skynet...for the government.  Right?
What's that?
And so you feel nothing.
I'm sorry.  I shouldn't have said...
I see.  And this...computer, thinks it can win by killing the mother of its enemy, kill- ing him, in effect, before he is even conceived?  A sort of retroactive abortion?
Okay, let's see...Got a pos- itive on her.  She's Sarah Connor, works as a legal--
Here's her driver's license.
That stuff's two hours cold.
Go!  Go!  He's got her.
It is so very inappropriate for you to mention my father.  Or, did you think this, between us, was friendship?  Just because you went fishing with my father, I should sit on my hands while you throw my money away?
I only mention it because I took the test this afternoon, down on Montgomery Street.
Terrific.  I now have a hundred dollar dry cleaning bill.
I want to know what's going on.  Are you part of this?
You've got to be kidding.
It's run by a company... they play elaborate pranks.  Things like this. I'm really only now finding out myself.
The lights went out, one hundred people all ran away...
Don't even think about it.
I'll give you a boost.
This isn't an attempt to be gallant. If I don't lift you, how are you going to get there?
This is C.R.S.
You're the one who started running.
That one did.
Never did catch your name.
Goodnight.
I think I would remember.  What makes you think it's me?
What did you say?
Who is it?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
What do you think you're doing?
They won't...
He's got a gun.  Everyone, he's got a <u>real</u> gun up here!  Real situation!  ... damn it...
Open that door, you'll see.  Your brother's there... Conrad.  He's there.  It's your birthday party...
Julliard, yeah.
Hey there, Nickie.
Happy Birthday, man.
Not after I'm done with it.  Actually, I've been here.  In grad-school I bought crystal-meth from the maitre d'.
Never better.
You need anything?
Will you?
Do it for YOU.
Calm down.  Why would they keep playing after you paid?
Do you know how to change a tire?
Because you hate me.  Because you had to be here, when mom died.  Because you had to do it alone.  Well, don't you think if I'd known... I'd've been here too.  I'd have been here...
What?
We'll help with the police, if you want to bother.  As far as money goes... can I make a suggestion?  You say you were mugged?
It's just a t.v.  He's just an actor.
Jim Feingold, V.P., E.D.A. Engineering and Data Analysis.
I don't write the questions.  I just review them.
We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
Physical?
Don't be nervous.  They said you'd be nervous.
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.  Here you go...
Hm?
Didn't I give you two?
Thank you.
Dinner's in the oven.
You did?  How is he?
Yes. What do you mean?  What's wrong?
What's this about?
There were complaints by other guests, and damage to his room.  We did the best we could to accommodate his behavior.
What?
Anything wrong... ?
Nicholas...
How concerned should I be?
He hasn't called back.
You know what I love about wine that comes in bottles like this?
I only saw Theo drive up.
Couldn't get the last ones.  You?
So why did you need the Addam's Family mansion for a scientific test?
That could have been worse.
Luke, can I talk to you?
Do you need me anymore?  Cause I'm going to bed.  They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
Is that the question of compassion or science?
It's not going to hold your weight.
Well, this lot is full!
What did it smell like?
So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories.  And a memory can trigger a smell.
Like she smelled it too?
Are you coming to confess?
Let's say it wasn't you.  Who did it?
The children want me.  They're calling me.  They need me.
But you told me to look in the paper!  You told me I'd be perfect!
Yes, this is Doctor Marrow.
When do we take the tests?
Well this is a cozy breakfast.
Maybe they're Mary's.
Your fear of him was real.  That's all the ghost anyone needs.
Why do you need a chain like that?
They're so beautiful.  Aren't they?
That'd be seventy in New York. You stole it!
Ohh, sure, you have trouble with commitment.
Theo... Did you?
Then who is?  Come on, Nell.  Deep down, if you really thought it wasn't Jim, why wouldn't you be leaving right this second?  Why wouldn't you be afraid?  Really afraid.
Nell, what happened?
This is real, I'm not making it up!  Theo, you saw it!  You were there -- the banging and last night.  You, you all saw the painting!
I'm going to stay with you until you fall asleep.  And then I'm going to get some brandy.
Is there anything in the world that you want or need?
Not for you, clearly.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
The freeway's faster, but lacks a certain majesty.
No.
I'll point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end- zone.  He's a hit-and-run gunman -- I figure he's not cruising the Polo Lounge.
You should have let me do the talking.
As it happens.  I didn't make that part up.
Where do <u>you</u> think he is, Mike.
No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now.
Oh really?  Where you from?
I mean, what has it been -- six months?
I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family.
This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit.
What more is there.
What, tryin' to catch him with another bird?
What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops?
I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison.
You're kiddin' me, right?
Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison.
Who'd you butcher at the house?
Huh?
Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right?
Didn't get it.
Hey, Elaine.  You even know what he's saying half the time?
Why did you come here?
What was that, then?
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out.  From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it?  Pink Floyd concert receipts.  Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Oh, it just ended, then.
Ashamed.
Disappointed.
-- Your employer?
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod.
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole.
She used to tell me she'd turn me in.  Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke.
That's where Valentine's scarpered.
Yeah, I guess you are.
Of the deal, man.
In which case I'll just do what I usually do.
Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
Don't you work with Ian?
What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying?
Out on a oil rig.  In the North Sea. Nine years.
Jesus, are you gay enough or what.
Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving?
She's nice lookin'.
Straight rotation, no shit, call your shot.
There is?
Like what.
He's expecting you?
You know her?
Where is he, then?
You've made it ... brighter.
Surely you can think of somewhere else to take one of your chippies for a quick getaway.
Yes?
Ann--
Ann, will you come in, sit down, maybe have a drink?
Hello, Rachel.
Sure... Sure, it's his house.
That's swell. However, the music, if you want to pursue it, well, the lessons from Mrs Swan, they'll only take you so far. There's this guy in San Francisco, I've made inquiries, everybody says he's the best. Trained lots of people who've gone on to have big concert careers, symphony orchestras, the works. His name is Jacques Carcanogues. I'm not sure I'm pronouncing it right. Anyway, he's a Frenchman.
You've got talent, anyone could see that. And he's the best. If he thinks a student has talent, he'll take 'em on for next to nothing. You're a cinch to be accepted, I could cover the cost of the lessons, like I said, it's pretty modest--
...I stank, didn't I?
...Mm.
Mistake, no, it says E-flat, she plays E-flat. Ping-ping. Hit the right note, always. Very proper.
...she can go up there.
Well, it's the wildest goose there is. Risk money. Very speculative. Except, Ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? I thought I had a prospect here. Well, I make the haul up and this lousy so-and-so tells me his situation has changed--all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. Thank you, mother! Pop goes another bubble! It's only the biggest business opportunity since Henry Ford and I can't seem to interest a soul!
Fifty-fifty, straight down the line. You and me. Finance and expertise. So--you've got the dough then, do ya?
No problem!
...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
All right.
...Oh, Jesus.
...What kind of man *are* you?
Rye.
...My first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. But maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. What if I could get the money?
Come on, get ready. It's important.
Dave.
...What's so damn strange about that?
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
I don't know what's going on. I--
...Doris--
OK, how did you know?
Will anyone else say they knew?
How did you get into the store?
Taking it seriously.
...Probity.
I'm so damn sorry about your loss. Terrible thing. Just damn terrible.
Yeah.
...I'm Rachel Abundas. Everyone calls me Birdy.
...so you tie your own flies, Ed. I mean, if you're really serious. You tie your own flies, you do a--I know it's matickless, I know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store-- but you can buy your fish at the store, Ed, you see what I'm saying?
...You sure, Eddie?
No, I mean it's growing, it's part of us. And we cut it off. And throw it away.
This is what family is for, Ed! This is when ya come together!
Close ranks! Goddamnit! Those sons of bitches!
They're just people like you and me, Ed. Remember that.
...We goin'?
Mr...?
Hello!
No, he's family, he's my brother-in- law.
...Look, pal, it's a tough break, but, uh... well damnit, your wife's been pinched.
...Yeah, it's a tough break.
There's some kind of animal loose in the museum.  Pendergast's alone.  He needs help.  I want volunteers to go with me.
I've read about the Museum's financial troubles.
I got it after I was mugged in the subway last spring.
Behind you.
Forget it!
Battery's dead.  Shit.
Ippolito!  Get back here!
Who are you?  The undertaker?
Saliva test?  You mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?
How big is the sub-basement?
Lieutenant!  It's me.
It's still back there!
What are we talking about here?
Now Margo, don't overreact.  Cuthbert has to cut costs somehow.  My leaving makes perfect sense.  This isn't exactly early retirement.  I've overstayed the party a bit.
With all due respect, dear, that's bull.  You dance rings around me with your new technology.  You've left me in the dust.
Come on.  I'll walk you back to the elevator.
This isn't a death sentence.  Greg has promised to teach me fly fishing.  I'll garden.  I'll write.
That Cuthbert.  What a piece of work. Someone's dead and all he cares about is his Superstition Exhibit.
What is it?
Like the claw.
Look at this.  An ambyloid reovirus protein.  That explains why the computer's confused.  The plant's infected with a virus.
All right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.  "Species unidentified.  Genus: unidentified.  Phylum unknown.  Male, weight in excess of 240 kg.  Brain capacity, 900 centimeters." That means it's highly intelligent. "Quadrupedal."
With the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.
What's going on?
None of that matters now.  The people upstairs need us.  We have to help.
Come back and get me.
Thank you for taking the time to help us with this, Dr. Frock.
We think it may have something to do with the eggs we found in the crate.
Dr. Frock, I was wondering.  What happened to the rest of Whittlesley's plants?
We were just lost, okay?  And we went down this curvy staircase.  At the bottom was a big shadow.
Not that big.
It had a long tongue, teeth this big and yellow eyes.
Hard to read in this light.  The ink is so faded.
Stop!
It's alright.  I can tell by the way the dog's acting that whatever was out there is gone.  What is this place?
Jesus, what is this?
If I spent half the time on my Fractal Evolution thesis that I spend on this fly rod, I'd have my PhD.
Turkish Gecko, I believe.  A lizard.
If he were alive he'd have contacted me.
That was two years ago.  John was still in love with me.  He wouldn't leave me alone.
My God.  Then it was an animal.
What happened?
I heard you calling and I ran after you, but you kept disappearing and I couldn't keep up.
What was it?
Pendergast?  Are you all right?
I don't know how to deal with this. It's hellish.  Like nothing I ever saw.  I'm not trained to deal with a monster, a supernatural creature like that.
But what can we do?  Our guns are useless --
That was D'Agosta.
Is there another way around?
What happened?
We have to try and draw it off!
Just like John.  He won't listen.
Viti Levu.  For how many?
The catalyst for the recent dramatic events was of course Truman's father, Kirk, and his infiltration onto the show. Before we discuss that, it's worth reminding viewers that this isn't the first time someone from the outside world has tried to reach Truman.
Of course, there hasn't been anything to compare with this - the first time an intruder has been a former cast member--
Let's talk ratings.  "Truman" has always enjoyed top ten status but the huge surge over the last few days--how do you hope to sustain that audience now that Truman appears to have reconciled himself?
Yes, everything you see on the show is for sale - from the actors' wardrobe, food products, to the very homes they live in--
Sure she would.
See here, this is us.  All the way round here, Fiji.  You can't get any further away before you start coming back.  Y'know, there are still islands in Fiji where no human has ever set foot.
You really think it could've dropped off an airliner?
I think it's got something to do with my dad.
I don't know what to think, Marlon. Maybe I'm going out of my mind, but I get the feeling that the world revolves around me somehow.
...personally I think the unconquered south face is the only one worth scaling...of course it's a 20,000 foot sheer wall of ice but then when did that ever stop me before?...Naturally, I intend to make the ascent without the benefit of oxygen but also without crampons or even an ice pick...<i>risks?</i>...  ...sure I'm aware of the risks--why else do you think I would spend seven years as an adjuster in a life insurance company...?
What's that?
Where have you been?
What did you want?
Blocked at every turn.  Beautifully synchronized, don't you agree?
It's hard to go places, isn't it?
Truman, what about that sign?
Let me get you some help, Truman.  You're not well.
Stop this now.  I'll do it.  I swear.
--What are my plans now?  Well, next I'm thinking of tackling the Yuba River in an authentic canoe from the Algonquin tribe. --I'm talking about the north fork, a class five rapid - only I'm not going <i>down</i> the Yuba, I'm going <i>up.</i>  Do you honestly think for one minute I'd go back to some dreary office to rubber stamp meaningless documents...do you?
We ought to be getting you back, Mother.
How's it going, Truman?
I think you better tell us.
I need your clothes, Byers.
And you have conclusive evidence of this? Something to tie this claim of yours to the crime --
This man's still alive.
Do you want me to destroy this one, too? Before it gestates?
And if it's unsuccessful?
You want a call if we turn up Kurtzweil?
You follow me out here for a reason?
Who sent you?
Michaud was a twenty-two year veteran of the bureau --
I picked up the historical document of the venality and hypocrisy of the American government. The daily newspaper.
You told me you had answers.
You've been using me --
You didn't know my father --
You'd be shit out of luck if not for me. You saw what you saw because I led you to it. I'm putting my ass on the line for you.
Mulder...?
Jesus, Mulder...
Had you.
Where are you, Mulder?
Scully?
What? What are you talking about?
This isn't about you, Scully. They're doing this to me.
This is one of the firemen who died in Dallas?
And there's been no autopsy performed. There's no Y incision here; no internal exam.
Mulder, this is going to take some time, and somebody's going to figure out soon enough we're not even supposed to be here.  I'm in serious violation of medical ethics.
This looks like new grass to you?
Ground's dry about an inch down. Somebody just laid this down. Very recently, I'd say.
Unmarked tanker trucks... what are archaeologists hauling out in tanker trucks?
And where are they going with it?
We're not chasing trucks, we're chasing evidence --
Been where?
You hear that?
Where'd they go?
I can, Mulder. I debated whether or not to even tell you in person, because I knew --
I'm contacting the state board Monday to file medical reinstatement papers --
Why was I assigned to you? To debunk your work. To reign you in. To shut you down.
...my pulse feels thready and I've got a funny taste in the back of my throat.
On whose orders?
Agent Mulder -- we both know that if you and Agent Scully hadn't taken the initiative to search the adjacent building, you could have multiplied the fatalities by a hundred --
She's in there right now saying the same thing about you.
A virus?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
We've allowed this man his freedom. His books have actually helped us to facilitate plausible denial. Has he outlived his usefulness to us?
You can't kill Mulder. He's got too much light on him.
We've been over this a dozen times.  No.
I do it all the time!
I'd be there for him.
The first... What?  Six or seven times I went in.   Remember what happened?
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
...give a kiss to Edward.
What if he wasn't like this?  What if he was "normal?"  Conscious.  How far would you go?
This man is deeply disturbed, he...
Absolutely.  I suppose everyone does.
Whoa.  Hold on.  Aren't they the same guy?
He wants us to follow.  The little boy...
That went well.
He's mine?
Thank you.
She changed the codes.
Instead of going into his mind...
Is she alright?
You're looking well.
How's the patient.
The Phoenix office tested that hair thirty minutes ago.  And we got the match.
We proceed assuming she is.
Den leuten.
You were awfully good.
Oh, American, thank you. I like them.
Can I hear you?
I can try. Is it comedy, or tragedy?
Gestern bein heurigen...
H-E-Z-T...
Holly.
I wish I knew.
I'm going back home.
He's better dead. I know he was mixed up - but not like that.
...again.
Are you going, too?
...is there?
How do you know?
Oh, well.
...quarrel?
Cigarette, Miss Schmidt?
You know as much as I do, Miss Schmidt - you were intimate with Lime, weren't you?
Now then, Miss Schmidt, I'm not interested in your forged papers - that's purely a Russian case. When did you last see Lime?
Miss Schmidt, we know he is somewhere across the canal in the Russian sector... You may as well help us. In a few minutes Colonel Brodsky will be questioning you about your papers. Tell me where Lime is.
There you are, miss, your receipt for the letters.
Where?
I'm afraid I've never heard of you. What's your name again?
Did you ever hear of "The Lone Rider of Santa Fe?"
...to him.
Listen, Callaghan.
What the devil?
Tactful too, aren't we, Callaghan?
This is where he vanished.
A girl of spirit.
Didn't I?
I never knew there were snake charmers in Texas...
What time is it?
Get me Major Callaghan on the phone.
Welcome?
They wouldn't know me.
I was going to stay with him, but he died Thursday.
Oh, Mr. Martins, good evening.
What's that?
Well, yes. I suppose that is what I meant to say.
Striptease, sir.
Very popular, sir.
Listen...
Listen, Harry - I didn't believe that...
Part? You can have any part you want, so long as you don't interfere...I have never cut you out of anything yet.
...you.
Not necessarily. She'd probably want to help.
Dr. Winkel?
Could he have been at all conscious?
Did you know Mr. Lime well?
...Popescu...
Happened...Yes happened right down there.
The Roumanian?
I thought there was something funny about the whole thing.
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
Why not? Thai girls best in the world. Thai food best in the world. Thai dope best in the world.
Richard, it's secret. That's the whole point.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
A shark fin?
Big?
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
What about Moliere?
Bonsoir.
Hi.
That is just the kind of pretentious bullshit that Englishmen and Americans always say to French girls so that they can sleep with them.
Too far?
But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions?
No one follows that midrash.
And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf.
Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi.
Read the early Zionists on European Jewry; they sound like Goebbels.
...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it....
Bring your friends.... We're not his friends.
Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson?
It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire.
Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do.
You write that?  Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you.
No, they don't. Not the smart ones.  Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money.
Have you read Toynbee? Spengler?
Too difficult?
Which is what?
Why no silencer?
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
Bigger and better.
Where'd you get this?
How come there's no punctuation?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Va-yomer adonai el Avram: lech lecha mayartzcha oo-mimohlad-tcha oo-m'bayt avaycha el ha-ertez asher arecha...
I want to learn to read it.
Put something on. You're not supposed to be naked in front of it.
The sex is better.
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
No, I think you shouldn't.
What...? You think I'm Jewish?
Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why?
He commands it whether He exists or not...  Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
I didn't realize you cared.
Who's Eichmann?
Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews.
We want to build bridges to certain positions in the political mainstream: works like <i>The Bell Curve</i>, <i>Sociobiology</i>, anti-Zionism, anti- immigration, the com-munitarian issue.... We'll hold conferences: invite liberals, blacks, Jews. Chomsky, Cockburn, Stanley Crouch, Shahack....
Let me give you an example.... Sexuality.
Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you?  After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man.
Who? How would I know him?
You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter?
That's what I'm trying to find out, Danny. Who am I fucking with here?
But if the Jews are strengthened by hate, wouldn't this "destruction" you speak of -- by love or by any other means -- in fact make them more powerful than they are already?
Did you kill Ilio Manzetti?
It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would.  Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue?
I always won.
Which <i>Times</i> guy?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
Balint?
What part of Germany are you people from?
Without blood -- a willingness to spill it -- there's no real power, no authority.
How have things been going?
This will be a different kind of device.
That's all we've got left.
When do you want it to go off?
You remember Miriam....
She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney...  We're getting married next spring. In Israel.
Who'd you kill?
SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT...
Who's this?
Leary?
Adam Sandler.
After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything.
Oh, fuck you...
The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that?
He's shy, not like Enzo.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
Johana, am I boring you?
Did the driver really freeze?
My God!  I'm glad I didn't go.
Good afternoon.
He seems to have won it.
I tell you she's mine!
Where did you two meet?
Is it a poem?
Because you'd laugh.
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
He can learn.  He is learning.
Is he alright?  What happened?
What about the shoes?
And where did you say you were from?
What's with the voice?
I remember.  Hi Roberto!
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask.  Am I right?
No.
So, not married.  Well, good for you.  You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
Why?  Are they what's most important?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
... How long was I asleep?
You were right.
No, no.  You'll like it.  It's superb.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
Yes... Maybe... I don't know.  I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun.  Don't you think?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
Jacques, you set a world record.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
So have I.  ... Hello?
Well, then, talk to me some more.
What?
Jacques...?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
Why?
Assassin!
What kind of name is that?  To be named after a city?
Good.  That way I'll see more of you... Where are you going to stay?
How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on?
Your mother? Oh. Whoops.
Any sign of Santa?
What are we going to do? We're at least an hour from the front.
Oh my god. She's become my pimp. And she's whoring her bitch-son out to the highest bidder.
Mom, I have a real job. I do good things for this community. I help people.
I don't want to argue with you. Let's just eat in peace.
Let's let your tuchus breathe.
Well I have news for you mom. It is good enough...I'm good enough and I won't leave here until I hear you tell me...
It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet.
Man, that's far out! Hey, the Jets won!
What are you doing?
How do we bypass it?
What are you doing?
Hammer, you alright?
Sorry folks, I don't do couples.
Is someone with you -- can I get you a drink?
Is he in love with you?
Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
Can't make a buck without my leopard. I tell you, Mr. Manning, you gotta find that cat for me -- or pay up.
What did they say before the bad card came up?
You and your cards. Meet a rich man! I look for them with money. What rich man hasn't money. And for what was I born if it wasn't for money? You're not telling me anything.
Well -- did he give you a lot of money?
He will be waiting...
Pedro is waiting for me, too.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower.  Click — click — click.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches ——
Oh, Mr. Galbraith! I'm so glad you're here.
It doesn't jibe with this —— you told me the leopard would go out into the country —- it wouldn't stay in the city ——
But it doesn't eat what it kills.
It could be a man.
Come on, Charlie. Let's go find another and better suspect.
It was you.
Tell me.
What do you do now?
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith.  I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Wait ——
That's why it just mauls and tears at them.
I've been trying to tell him, Sheriff. He won't listen to me.
Get it out of here!
That's easy. Me.
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft—soap twenty editors!
I can use them.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
And she waited here for him?
I'm glad you care about us, Kicks. Sometimes that gets kind of lost in the racket --
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
Oh, by the way -- I'm out of cash --
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside -— where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Ha-ha... Yeah...  What about that road back there, though? It says ‘closed to the public’, doesn’t it?
That might depend on where you’re going.
I’m afraid they are out at the moment, sir.
You wouldn’t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh?  Her brother’s death.
You seem surprised. Could it be you don’t think that badly of him after all?  You needn’t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
No. The question now is how long it’s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Mr Lombard?
When did you get back?
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
One just doesn’t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier’s being tailed?
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
You know something? I’ve just seen so much ugliness I don’t think I’d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time.  I’d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that’s the way you want it.
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
There’s nothing wrong with the line, sir. Are you sure you have the right number? 770 471 is the number of a call box.
Good morning, sir. How can I help you?
I’m sorry, sir. Could you try that again?
You’re sure you won’t sit down, Miss Stewart?
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?
Friedman’s dead... They killed him...
Some Italian I picked up back there. He’s in the boot of the Mustang.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid.  Can I have the keys to your house?
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to! 
Why?
What sort of puppy are you looking for?
So, what are you looking for?
How much of a hurry are you in?
Who are you?
I don’t know. He’s gone!  He’s gone. I don’t fucking know where, I swear... He’s gone. On holiday...
Who’s the money man?
And who does Friedman work for?
What’s the Ambassador?
I’m sorry but Mr Gluck is not answering, sir.  Would you like to leave a message?
The Hyatt. Good afternoon. May I help you?
You sure you passed on my message?
Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
I came to feed your fish. I didn’t know...
I’d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can’t, don’t worry about it. I’ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I’m in a hurry. 
May I...?
What if it is?
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
The room’s yours for 24 hours. It’s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
Clients come and go.
Where is Friedman?
What is it?
The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
What are you going to do now? Call the police?  Take him away? I must warn you he’s terrified of men, so...
We didn’t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
They’re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It’s not guilt, more of a curse...  And then there’s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that’s just one of Leon’s dark delusions...
Who else knows about the boy?
Is she on the phone?
J’ai bien peur qu’il te faudra attendre.  Pas avant la matinée.
Gluck.
Five seconds. Then you die.
So why didn’t he?
When they realise I’m missing...
Mossad?
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God?  Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught.  Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no.  And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no.  Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
Jeanne, stop it!
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
No, but...
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
Will you at least let me stay with you?
We must sound the retreat!
Do as I say!
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
And?
No, I... I held it up to...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
Who's running this trial, you or her?  I can't believe it!  This wretched girl -- how dare she speak to us like that?
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way.  You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Quick -- hide in here...
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
The English??
Show us a little more cooperation first.  Where were you born?
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own.  We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her.  But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority.  Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you.  So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
What did it tell you?
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Not so well, I regret to say.  This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment.  That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
Mmmm.  Yes.  I know for example the sickness that plagues your heart.  I know how painful it is for you... to have loved a father... without ever knowing if he really was yours.
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Is it long and hanging down?
It is all his majesty can afford. He has even donated his very own personal savings.  His majesty will greatly appreciate a gesture of good will in this delicate negotiation between our two families.
May I, without offending you, inquire how generous?
8,000.  We can't raise more... We can only place ourselves at the mercy of your generosity.
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
Wait, wait...
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Jeanne, what are you doing with that... you've got it back to front...
Stand by with the battering-rams...
My lord Dunois... I have wonderful news! -- finally -- he's sending her to us -- thanks be to God -- we're saved -- it's wonderful!
But... don't you think we should at least... go and... welcome her?
I do love her when her fire gets well and truly stoked!
And... what does Jeanne think?
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
Jeanne... let him do it.  One more dead body's not going to make any difference, so who cares?
Bravo!  What about all the other hundreds of prisoners?  Do we let them go too?
Jeanne... we're not enough...
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
He never sent them... Don't you understand?  He doesn't want this war anymore... he has his crown now, that's all he ever wanted...
Did your voice tell you to jump?
So when you jumped, you wanted to kill yourself?
How can you deny it when you just said "I'd rather die than fall into the hands of the English"...?
Do you not know that suicide is a very grievous sin?  No one is allowed to destroy the life that God created!
You mean it was not of your own free will that you were on the ledge?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Jesus Christ... the goddamn English will pay for this!
Physicians are a waste of time. You'll have more luck with this charm of mine... it saved my life at Agincourt!
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
Jeanne... the man hasn't been paid for six months -- that's his only reward.  Let him take a few teeth...
What have you done to me?
My... visions...
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
What signs?
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned?  Come on Jeanne, be honest.  You fought for yourself, in your name.
I don't agree.  Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
Yes I am.
But you already confessed this morning...
Is that bad?
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
A beauty. Who is she?
This is my husband. Wladyslaw Szpilman. Marek Gebczynski sent him.
I nagged Jurek for weeks and weeks. And at last he gave in and said, 'All right, come with me tomorrow,' and so I came and they bombed the station.
Oh, Mr Szpilman, you're quite... quite wonderful.
To tell you the truth, I thought it would be worse.
Must feel better this side of the wall.
I'm on the run!
Henryk's in there.
Yitzchak, they told me you had influence.
No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --
You go to Heller, did I ask you to talk to him?
Did you beg, did you grovel to that piece of shit, that cockroach?
What did you pay him?
Wladek, stop that. It's over now. Just be proud it happened. My God, did they put up a fight.
They're in shock. They didn't expect it. Nobody expected it. Jews fighting back? Who'd have thought?
There are notices going up. The city's to be cleansed of undesirables.
Why didn't you come to me?
Pig!
And what do you think you'll do while you're setting up a new line of defence? Wander round lugging your suitcases?
No, no, no, I'm staying put. If I'm going to die, I prefer to die at home.
I'm sorry, I did my best, I thought the certificates would save us all.
I don't know how to thank you.
I'll play the piano again. On Polish radio.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
Which mountains are those dear?
One day when my mother and father were singing together in the forest, a great storm blew up out of nowhere. But so passionate was their singing that they did not notice, nor did they stop as the rain began to fall and when their voices rose for the final bars of the duet a great bolt of lightening came out of the sky and struck my father so that he lit up like a torch... And at the same moment my father was struck dead my mother was struck dumb! She- never-spoke-another-word.
Well, that is a strong opinion.
I got the good wife for you Peini. She pray good. Clean. Read Bible. You sleep her Peini. She chief daughter.
Go Peini ... Haere atu e Peini.
You'd have to organise it up here.
T-w~e-l-v~e.
Yes, why not.
You have to wash them.
We can't leave the piano
What does she say?
He's given it to us.
You the owner here?
Which way are the rooms?
Visitation is still up by two at the three-quarters.  Single Action second, Fasanella third.
I dunno.  That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
Sorry, pal.  I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
I'm gettin' too slow for this racket.  I done the best I'm gonna do.  You hang on too long, you start embarrassin' yourself.
Okay, finish your count and get it up here as soon as you can.  I don't wanta be here all night.
Glad to meet ya, kid.  You're a real horse's ass.
I'll take him anyway.
You can't do it alone, ya know.  It takes a mob of guys like you and enough money to make 'em look good.
You just worry about your end, kid.
How'd ya do?
No signs of trouble?
You think he'll show?
He's been taking the 8:10 Century Limited outa New York on Friday and getting in here early Saturday morning.  He usually stays a day to check on his policy operations, and then flies back.
I'm not sure I know it.
Raise 500.
Hi there, Snyder.  Things a little slow down at the Bunco Department tonight, eh?  Somebody lose the dominoes?
My end was only one.
We don't doubt that, but there's a counterfeiting operation passing bad money in the station.  Have you made any purchases here today?
It isn't any better.
She don't work here no more.  I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
I don't mean nothin' by it.  I just don't know many regular girls, that's all.
You sure it'll be one of these two?
Aw, come on, Hooker, why don't you just...
You should always look to the back too, kid.
You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
You got the 400 grand yet?
You've already done time twice, and judges don't like three time losers. You wanna sit in the can for forty years, startin' tonight?
On a 6-1 shot?  The hell with ya. We'll keep the deal we got.
All right, Riley.  What the hell happened?
Cause the stoolies are used to street dicks jumpin' him.  If word gets around that Feds are in on it too, Gondorff'll fold up the whole thing.
He's gonna set up Gondorff for us.
Have the police got any idea where Wynant is?
What's your next step, Nick?
Why not?
Then just say he was sixty years old.
I didn't know you invented that Smelting Process.
Well!
Mind if I look around?
Darling, don't cry.  Please.  I know it's terrible.  But isn't it really better this way?
Then what are you hiding?
Did he tell you where he was going?
That's it...  Herbert Macaulay.
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
There. 
I don't know.
Dead?
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
I know -- I know --
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
But it isn't bad weather now.
You can take that out to the car.
Did they find any clues...  a gun or fingerprints or anything?
Why not? You had a perfectly good motive.
I saw him too... he was wearing a green suit with a white tie...
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Nothing.
Ask him.  I don't know.
Have you got a pistol permit?
Who's is it?
You oughtn't to play this trick on me.  Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
Well, what'd you think?
Could this be him?
I wasn't in.  My secretary took the message.  He left word for me to meet him at the Plaza.
There are a few things we want to check up on.
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
Are you sure you didn't leave the room...  that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
That's ridiculous.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
I think we may as well sit down.
She drives me nuts.  She's been ragging me all day.
Who's that man?
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
That's my business.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Oh, please, Nick.
One hundred...  two hundred... three...
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
Dorothy told me you were here.  I was going to telephone but....
She usually is.  Trying one way or another to get money out of Wynant. I wanted to find out if you were er - er -  --sleuthing for her.
I have no right to answer that.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Where's Gilbert?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
Oh, did he?  What did he say?
Perfectly absurd.
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted - 
I've never heard about you.
Why tell me?
What's that?
You might have mentioned me first.
Pretty girl.
Who is she?
By the way, how is your father's side?
What hit me?
Isn't that my drink?
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
There's one coming.
On it!  I'm in it ... They think I did it!
Finished with these?
Aren't you hot in that?
Is that another Christmas present?
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
But Wynant --- ?
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
You bet I wouldn't.
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Nick!
Wynant's body?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
What things made you so sure?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
I hope you're well.
How did you get in here?
You his wife?
I'm sorry...  but...
I just wanted to tell you...
Who fired you?
Think we're going to do it?  Think we're going to war?
What are we going to do!?
They stopped.
What if it's a Valloro 69?  Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
All we've got to do is make it to the top.
Not much of a pass.
The US Army:  Always an adventure.
You're the one with all the ideas.
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold.  Maybe you've already got things worked out.
What happened?
I'm the one's got the big stick.
Wes--
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
Give it to me!
At-at-at-at-at.
Don't get pissed at me, just 'cause I want to be ready when this war starts.
And you know what that area is?  It's Iraq.  IRAQ!  We're doing a little thing with them right now; Desert Storm.  Maybe you've read about it.
Now this is war.
Invest it.
Take the binoculars.
And you missed this?  How are you going to miss something like this?
You didn't step on any mine.
How'm I gonna relax standing on a mine!?
Where you going?
You're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!?  It's going to blow up!
You're going to be fine.
You don't know that.  It could be a trick.
They're doing more than slapping.
Not enough.  We're out numbered and out gunned.  They'd cut us to shreds.
X marks the spot.
Where is it?  Where'd it go?
What are we going to do?  What the hell are we going to do?
A whole lot of nothing.
What are you doing?
He's not going to leave us.
Why do I have to stay down here?
We should head Northeast.
What are we going to do?  How are we going to find our way back!?
I'm sorry about that, Epps.
I'm glad I didn't have to kill you.  I'm glad it didn't come to that.
Wonder how the war's going?
Getting cold.
Epps...Epps!  I'm gonna stop for a second.
Even if they are Iraqis probably all they'll do is take us prisoner for awhile.  Got to figure we're still kicking their asses in the war.  They don't want any trouble.
What do we do?
What do you make of them?
It's always been like that.  When you left me down in the crevice to send the gold up I figured I'd better...take precautions.  I rigged it to blow if anyone opened the pack.  Just in case somebody thought they could do better on their own.
I'm thinking about taking a trip.
Epps, I don't think he's slowing down.
Could you stop, please.  You're giving me a headache.
You get it yet?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes.  No more drills.  We stand at full ready starting--
Jaeger?
You ever think about dying?
Epps, you're smarter than this.  Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Epps, is that a sand dune.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel?  Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
Really?  What is that, an order, <u>private</u>?
Epps...
How long we going to keep this up.
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Think we can make it?
Maybe they're as scared of us as we are of them.
It's got a bottom.
With what?  He doesn't have a weapon.
Stress category.
4000 degrees is usually the point of....?
I'm not hungry.
You know I don't feel well.
When?
Then why did you bring it up?
Look, food!
Now...now, I'm sorry...don't - don't....please.  It's just... I was happy.  Why get me involved? You told SEN that you weren't satisfied with me.
Three!  I'm going to be late for my shift.
I can't go on like this.  I can't....  I don't just sit around and watch people.  If I make a mistake, it's all over.  You see it every day.  Do you want to see me taken away in pieces?
I couldn't turn you in, not now. I....I know I wouldn't!
THX!
You always manage to avoid the issue:  What's wrong with our present condition?  We're COMFORTABLE and we have plenty of food...I feel absolutely no threat because there is no threat. Why incite trouble?  You should examine your emotions.  It is senseless...
Who?  Who's leaving?
He's coming back for the rest of us.  He can't make it alone.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.
I'm sure it's warmer in her than outside, though.  I haven't been out yet, but it usually is...the control is fouled... 
What's going on?
I'm leaving.
How do you know?
Lost SEN!  He'll never find us.
She's not there
Yes.
Yes.
....I'm taking SP5, but it doesn't seem strong enough.  I have a hard time concentrating.  Please forgive me, I slipped on....
....with me?  What am I to her or she to me?  Nothing.  She's an ordinary roommate.  I..I share...
And you are...?
Who the heck're you?
Where did you get this?
Sorry about that.  That's an inch of the stuff, imagine what the whole thing'd do.
What're you talking about?
By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
We don't use the b-word. Bad luck.
Treat. We treat devices.
Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us "punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did.
There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
Ex-girlfriend?
Driving in circles, waiting for-
Glass, Eighth Street, alley behind Grand Hotel. Cut him off.
Fuck factor?
C'mon, talk to me! We can do it!
Wires... metal, cold... something soft...
Something round, two wires ...
Assist? What the hell you know about tickers anyway?
What do you think?
Right.
You got it.
Political.
Yeah, he's helping us work up a profile on this thing.
We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
What do ay say?
There is a motel downtown, near the Machine Shop... the Suncrest. Room 138.
What's the matter?
Who are you calling, sis?
Drop it.
I want to work this.
What the hell was that?
What about the ballistics report?
That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.
Good boy, Schnoz. Daddy loves you.
Oh shit...
P.E.T.N ...
Vice cop on a homicide?
Looks like Pooch's doing okay.
Glass, you're to stand by with your team.
Reilly, you're done for now. What the hell were you thinking directing the Bomb Squad Team into hot pursuit. They had no business-
Reilly, what the hell are you-?
Yes.
Pardon me, m'sieu. Madame Colet would like to see you in the living room.
Eleven o'clock! 
And harems ... ?
Good morning, Major.
No color, no sparkle--but dependable.
Yes, sir?  What shall we start with, Baron?
Yes, Baron.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
And as for you, waiter--
You can trust me.
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
I hope you find the figures correct.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Very well, m'sieu.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five.  Let's see--  You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
You say I am a crook.
No, no, no! I disagree with you absolutely. That's the trouble with you artillery men.
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Please.
I like you, Baron.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
The fourteenth of May.
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
Don't you <u>realize</u>--
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
You like that statue?
Neither do I.  That's where I found it.
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue?  Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
Naturally I did.
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and <u>should</u>, get love letters.
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
Eighteenth century.
It's disgraceful!
Yes, madame?
Then a little nap--
Crimson!
Precisely.
No--yours, madame.
You look beautiful.
Lovely.
Yes, madame?
About what?
Yes, madame?
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
Holy shit.
Hey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second.
We're too late.
What could possible be funny?
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
Something serious has happened.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
You know somebody?
I don't understand a one of you. What's the matter with you? It's your men back there! We got plenty a' room for more.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.  Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
So, you got a name by the way?
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
So don't marry him.
It is that simple.
And these were drawn from life?
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
Now it's worse.
Will this work?
I'm not going without you.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
I don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea.
I'm sorry.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
Do you want to se me working as a seamstress? Is that what you want? Do you want to see our fine things sold at an auction, our memories scattered to the winds? My God, Rose, how can you be so selfish?
Anya, I think you're crazy.
It would be a nice change from you.
Hope we're not intruding.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
Oh--a hundred times--
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Good afternoon--
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
A rare pleasure to meet you, ma'am! Where I come from --out in Montana--we have some pretty women, but I guess if you walked down Main Street they'd turn out the fire brigade.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Aces full.
I'm so sorry!
I thought you were one of my friends.
Nice lines--
Where have you been hiding?
Yes?
Don't rub it in.
When?
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
We coulda got two third-class!
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
Nix, the law!
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
Not a chance.
Thank you, sir. 
On the drunk.
Come in! 
How's your mother feeling?
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
This has nothing to do with me--  But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this--  --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--<U>here</U>--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Hello, young fellow!
Wouldn't bet against her.  Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France.  Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Mmmmmmmmmhm....  Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
Here's your fifty.
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out.  "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where <U>is</U> "Back"?
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank.  Where is your wife?
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Why--don't you like him?
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
That's him! That's the sucker!!
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
Out my way in Montana we always call a bluff. 
How much did you lose?
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
I wish I could.
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
I tried to borrow a gun from Chad, but--
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
There you are, sir.
I'm all right.
I said that's 500 to you, Holliday.  In or out?
God damn son of a...
Newcomers, eh?  Names John Behan, I'm Cochise County Sheriff.  Just Hit town?
Where'd you get that horse?
Shut up, Ike.
I'm retired.
Oh, we ride for a brand all right.  This brand.  How 'bout you?
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
Let me, let me, yeah!  Die, you Bastard...
You don't even know him.
How you feeling, Doc?
Since when is faro a business?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger.  The Odds are all with the house.
So now we're in the mining Business.  Turning into regular Tycoons.  Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock.  Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
So what does he want?
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree?  A better one might be how Do you feel?
You think I'm kidding.  You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known.  Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
Drunks.  Crawfished a bet, called Him a liar.  I saw the whole thing.
Told you.  I'm red hot, I'm Blazin'!  Now, red seven.  Seven Stinkin' diamonds.  Look out!  Five Thousand!  Let's go!
Can't take the heat, get outta The kitchen.
Hello, Wyatt!  Hiya Doc!
No.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings.  Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked.  I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package.  Can't put it Together for some reason.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him.  So help me God, I would.
All right, what's it to be?  New Mexico's that way.
Wyatt, listen, you can't beat Him.  You're good and God knows You got the courage, but you Ain't in Ringo's class.  Hell, He's the best that's ever been. 'Cept maybe for Wild Bill.
We're the law, ain't we?  Well the Law don't ride around vermin-
What is it?
That was lovely!
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Doesn't suit you.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
What's wrong?
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
I hate Sadie.
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
Sorry about your friend.  And I'm sorry about...
What can I get you?
Oh, all right.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on.  And we could Stay on the move, you know?  Just Keep going, see the world.  Live On room service the rest of our Lives.  How'd that be?
'Least you admit it.
Look, I got a rule.  I don't talk To lawmen.  Dog-catchers neither.
No, wait.  Please.  I know nothin' I say'll fix things but I want You to know it wasn't me.
What'd you do that for?
Next waterhole's Black Draw.  We Could be there by mid-morning.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Hey Doc!  Come on now.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else.  It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone.  But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
That thunder's sure somethin'.
You were right, Wyatt.  They got Me good.  Don't let 'em get you Too.
You back that Queen again, you Son of a bitch, I'll blow you Right out of that chair!  Somethin' on your mind?
That a fact?
For a man that don't go heeled You run your mouth kinda reckless.
Go ahead.  Skin it.  Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Easy, gents. Private affair...  Wyatt! Doc! Hey!
Allie-girl...And Louisa!  You're So lovely.  I'm at your feet, Darlin'.  Just at your feet.  Guess it's only right.  Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
I couldn't help it, Wyatt.  I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face.  I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture.  That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt.  It's-
What about all these saloons?
Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute?
I'm sure they will.
The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong.  My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
Tsi tien, Chien-penny.
Yes -
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Oh, James. I've missed you -
What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
Do you feel better now?
Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files?
There is one last thing, 007: Elliot Harmsway is vital to the economic interests of this nation. He's also a major contributor to the party. I expect him to be given every consideration.
Okay, Saunders. What is it this time? Rocket in the leg? Machine pistol in the arm?
It was an authorized test. I returned the money.
Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter.
That's reassuring.
Natalya?
She married a hockey player.
Bourbon. Neat.
Do I have to do everything around here?
Blood or Dutch?
This has got to be a mistake.
Down?
Put your arms around my neck. Lock your legs around my waist.
Here. You shoot. I'll drive.
And when might that be?
...You're turning into quite the politician, 007.
... And what do you call these?
I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck.
A dead head.  Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west.  Muncy! Engines to half!
The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel.
Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly.
Bore through.  ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond.  They're wrong.  Revenge is the best revenge.
... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account?
Who is that?!? What's in the box??
Your mother asked me not to mention it but your mother's birthday was last week.
When are you going to find time to help me fix the roof?
You want me to mortgage my house to invest in a scheme of yours? You know the last time we went into something together Daddy had to go in his savings to keep us from ending on the street.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
Who is it?
I'm going back home with Harry.
I'm busy.
Son, would you do me a favor and see if you could turn off that tap in the bathroom. My hand is too weak. And would you do me another favor? I don't like asking this but would you clean the tub for me? I have trouble bending over.
Not anymore, not in the city.
He ain't nothing like me. How come a man has to have sons that are day and night apart? You ought to stop protecting him.
You're always taking his side.
Well, it's up to Suzie.
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
Since this morning.
He's going to check out heaven first. He gets a round trip ticket to heaven. He gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. People dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. He asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "I thought the streets were paved with gold." "They are but you won't see them," he said. "Boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." So he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. He sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "Man, this is a dream." He asked, "What's you'll doing?" They all hollered back, "Sinning." The devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "Please to meet you." He asked, "I thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." Someone said, "Man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." The man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...
This is my grandson, Sunny. He is my youngest son's child.
It's the boy next door throwing at his birds. I'm just waiting on him to hit a pane in the window
Next time when I feel a little better perhaps.
How often is your wife called to help delivery?
My daddy called me boy up to the time he died. I was always boy to him.
Good evening. It must be all the different time zones I crossed that makes me feel this weary.
How is everybody?
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
Good God Almighty, bless your bones.  But the problem grows.
Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
I was quoting from the Bible. If the shoe fits, wear it.
He should be caring. That is not too much to ask.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
When did you talk to Harry?
You shouldn't talk about the boy's father in front of him. This is family business and we have to pull together.
Wow!  Cool!
Yeah!
Come on down, guys.  It's time for games!  We've got prizes!
Can I bring some toys?
Mom!  Do you know where Buzz is?
Andy!  I'm heading out the door.
Can I help pump the gas?
I looked everywhere, honey, but all I could find was your hat.
Which one can I open first?
Well, let's see, we've got double A's --
I tell you, I could fly around this room with my eyes closed!
Why, thank you.  Thank you all. Thank you.
Oh, no, no, no...  Buzz, look!  An alien!
What's going on?
Oh.  Oh, that's good.
What's gotten into you, Sheriff?  I was --
I've set my laser from stun to kill.
Woody, we don't know what's out there!
It's not working.  I recharged it before I left.  It should be good for hours --
Get away!  Hoo-cha!  Hoo-cha!
I think you've had enough tea for today.  Let's get you out of here, Buzz.
Buzz!!  What are you doing?  I thought you were --
Woody!  It's the moving van.
Nice work, fellahs.  Good job. Comin' out of the ground -- what a touch!  That was a stroke of genius.
Woody?!  What are you doing?
Ahhh!! This is the part where we blow up!
Me?  No, no, no, no...  Are you?
Oh, impressive wingspan.  Very good!
Hey, watch it!
No, no, not the ear.  Gimme the nose.  C'mon!
I don't know!
What?
Sid, give her back!  Give her back now!  I'm telling!
Huh?!  Huh?!  I told you he was guilty.
I'm sorry.  It's just that I get so nervous before I travel.
Wait a minute.  You -- you don't think I meant to knock Buzz out the window, do you Potato Head?
Did you all take stupid pills this morning?!  Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz?  And now you want to let him back over here?
If I send out the troops, will you all calm down?
Ha ha.  That's very funny, Buzz.  This is serious!!
They're getting bigger.
What the heck is up there?
Sargent.  Establish a recon post downstairs.  Code red.  You know what to do.
Okay, we're on the last present now...
Oh, no...it's a Combat Carl.
Reach for the sky!!
Just gather everyone up for a staff meeting and be happy!!
I can manage.
Don't fret. It's only his dream. Dreams aren't catching, not like measles.
I want to go home.
What was <i>that</i> in aid of?
That's your beach. This is the story. Leda walks by the shore, gathering shells.  Night comes on. She hears the beating of great wings and sees the approach of the swan. She runs away but it bears down and casts her to the ground. Curtain.
Would you mind holding me in your arms for a little while?
Nothing ... You shouldn't have given Victoria that Guinness.
I already lost everything once.
But then I had a brother and a sister left.
I... I don't really know.
Anna.  What's wrong?  What do you want?
Why does he need money?
If Manolo hadn't gone and told them what he did then Salazar and Madrigal would never have been brought to justice.  He did a great thing for Tijuana.  He did a great thing for Mexico.
Good.  From now on I want you to expect that every word you utter will be tape-recorded, that the movement of your lips is being read. Got it?
I don't know, but under no circumstances would I talk about it here.  I want you to go home and relax the best you can.  Continue your life as if nothing has happened. That is very important.
It's the same stuff?  From the rainy day stash?
And you didn't feel like you could trust my wife with this news?
We'll ground her, clip her wings a bit.  School and scheduled activities and that's it until further notice. This has to be handled delicately. Dan Kelly, in the District Attorney's office, will probably help us out, quietly.  Christ, this could be embarrassing.
How long have you known?
I think we may have found our Mexican Drug Czar.  It's this General, Salazar.  At least I'll have somebody on the other side I can talk to.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
Did you tell Dad?
You all right?
Helena --
We'll get through this, I promise. I'll make it up to you --
As it happens, the President of the United States, my new boss, the leader of the free world, has me penciled in for some "face time".
Live with your parents?
Private?
Inhale the smoke and hold it.
No telltales.  Nothing to read. Not touching my face.  Not even blinking.  No giveaways.  How're you feeling?
They're whispering.  I can't hear them, but I know it.  I smell conspiracy.  I feel the lie vibrating out of the home.
Are you getting this on tape?
Remember when we sat on that mob guy, that chef, for like six months?
David --
Yes.
I don't know.  Eduardo Ruiz is the only real witness against Carl.  The security is very tight.  There may not be a way.
So, it's worth the wait, right? What can I do?  Rent a Huey?  Have an airlift?  It's not like you can put it in a condom up some mule's asshole, right?  How many peasants would that take?  A line stretching from here to Mexico City --
Listen you motherfucker, you tried to kill me with a fucking cannon.
He hired you.  That was a mistake.
Take this back with you.  Deliver it safely to Tigrillo in San Diego and we have a deal.
Relax.  If they were going to kill us they would have done it in the desert.
If you want her to stay out of it, then stop telling her everything. You should learn how to keep a secret.
Please.  Filing a report will not help you find your car.
This is fucking crazy.  Instead of killing us, he sends us on a suicide mission.  Do you know who Frankie Flowers is?  He's a psycho-cokehead- hitman.  A faggot.  He's killed fucking who knows how many people. You'd need half the force to get close to him.  And you can't get their help because he lives in fucking San Diego.
Madrigal's alive.
What's your name?
That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
The busiest land border crossing in the world.  Over forty-one thousand vehicles per day, twenty-two thousand pedestrians on foot.  I think we do a pretty good job but we know a lot of drugs are still getting through.
Who the fuck do you think you are? Where the fuck do you think you are? Why the fuck do you think I shouldn't just put you in a dumpster?
I got money.
Oh, man --
I don't give a fuck about your parents --
Hey man, I'm sorry.  I'm just trying to help.
Let me ask you a related question. We've talked about the supply side, but what about demand?  What is your policy for treating addiction?
Who are these guys?
Who do we interface with on their side?
What do we do?  Okay.  Fucked-up Bowman's turning blue.  Doctor.  We need a doctor.
Did you tell him?
I'm sorry.
Well, why didn't you bring them?
No, I don't mean like that -- I mean something nice, like, that's all --
Hey, I'm wanting a bet put on.
Two thousand, one hundred and thirty- three pounds.
Buy yourself that island in the sun?
Where's that?
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Sorry.
Come on.
I don't see why not.
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
What do you want?
You're too young.
It's so simple. We buy it at four grand, we punt it at twenty to this guy that Sick Boy knows, and he punts it at sixty. Everyone's happy, everyone's in profit. I put up two. I come away with six.
So, what's he like?
Actually it's a nightmare. I've been desperate for a shag, but watching him suffer was just too much fun. You should try it with Tommy.
What do you mean, it's 'gone'? Where has it gone, Tommy?
One of Edinburgh's finest schools.
I'm an old boy myself, you know?
Strive, hope, believe and conquer.
Only to get my foot in the door. Showing initiative, right?
There's no need.
Thanks, Mark.
Exactly.
Director?
Who wrote it?
Yeah.
Oh, fuck. Sick Boy reaches out to Allison.
God, you're sick.
I know a couple of addicts. Stupid wee lassies. I feed them what they need. A little bit of skag to keep them happy while the punters line up at a fiver a skull. It's easy money for me. Not exactly a fortune, but I'm thinking, 'I should be coining it here.'  Less whores, more skag. Swanney's right. Get clean, get into dealing, that's where the future lies. Set up some contacts, get a good load of skag, punt it, profit. What do you think?
Why would I want to sell my passport?
What?
What was your price?
Yeah. No more. I'm finished with that shite.
He's always been lacking in moral fibre.
No, I don't think so.
What's on the menu this evening?
And would sir care to settle his bill in advance?
No, thank you. I'll proceed directly to the intravenous injection of hard drugs, please.
Sounds great, Swanney.
If I'm giving up a whole day and the price of a ticket, I'm just saying it had better be good. There's plenty of other things I could be doing.
Six weeks and no sex?
A walk.
Homeless people?
Qual se tu?
We sought only your infinite wisdom.
He has his doubts...
Don't tell them you're lost. You'll never live it down.
You are a master of understatement. They are likely to destroy the planet.
Can we have it quiet?
The Klingon, the Romulan, the Federation consuls. Now I know Enterprise is not exactly up to specs...
Where did you get this power?
I feel as if a weight has been lifted from my heart. How can I repay you for this miracle?
What is it you seek?
You told me you could have the ship operational  in two weeks. I gave you three. What Happened?
Mr. Scott apologizes for having to send the shuttlecraft. The transporter beam is non-operational. Captain, we've received important orders from Starlet Command.
Captain, Starfleet transmission on line.
Captain, we're receiving the hostage information you requested.
Standard orbit, Mr. Sulu.
Bird of Prey bearing one zero five mark two.
Goodnight, Spock.
Spock, what is it? Do you know this Vulcan?
I do not often think of the past.
When he encouraged others to follow him, he was banished from Vulcan, never to return.
Spock.
Damnit, Spock. God damnit!
Forgive you? I ought to knock you on your goddamn ass!
You stay out of this!  Why, Spock? Why? I.. All you had to do was pull the trigger.
You did too. Sybok couldn't possibly be your brother because I happen to know for a fact that you don't have a brother.
There, you see? See?
How do you know?
New word. "b".. "a"... um...
...mark two.
What is this?
We must change our course at once.
What you fear is the unknown. The people of your planet once believed their world was flat. Columbus proved it was round. They said the sound barrier could never be broken. It was broken. They said warp speed could not be achieved. The Great Barrier is the ultimate expression of this universal fear. It's an extension of personal fear.  Captain Kirk, I so much want your understanding. I want your respect. Are you afraid to hear me out?
No... I didn't.
You are mad!



Borgus Frat.
I know you'll whip her into shape, Scotty. You always do.
Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
I know you better than that.
Sybok, we must find a way...
I don't get it.
Oh my. Meanwhile, kids are putting eight million quarters a week in Space Paranoids machines and I'm not seeing one dime.
Dillinger?
Not if my Tron program was running. That would seal the system off. If your file's in there...
Shouldn't you wait till your lawsuit's settled?
Flynn had Group 7 access.
I want to go to his place.
I don't think I'm cleared for this.
Ever since he got that Master Control Program set up, system's got more bugs than a bait store.
Come on in...
Well, I don't know...I just tried to run this program I've been working on, and I was denied access all of a sudden. I thought maybe I'd been laid off and nobody told me.
You said it.
It shouldn't be any harder than General Motors was. But now...this is what I get for using humans.
That was uncalled-for.
Yes?
Dumont... my User has information that could -- could make this a free system again.
Flynn!!
Hey... you guys OK?
Hey, Ram ... what were you ... you know, before?
He was disoriented in transport, Tron.
Hey! Good to see you guys! Nothing classes up the place like a cleancut young couple.
A User?
Well, I -- it's just -- I don't know, a User, I mean... Users wrote us. A User even wrote you...
But-what if I can't...?
Yes, and now you've got two renegade programs running all the hell over the system in a stolen simulation.
You think we can make it there?
Do you know what he's talking about?
Yori... hey...
What is it?
Are you kidding?  Harry had to go out of town.
Can you cover me for an hour?
Where are you going?
You seem fine now.
Dana, are you listening to me?
How was school today?
Dad, how come you know the words?
And this is a little above market-				* rate for the horizontal bop, even				* for a total biscuit like her.
Uh huh.  Right here in river city.
And the second you left there, we started getting calls to the					* ghost numbers.  They were checking out the Renquist front.
Copy that.
Abu Kaleem Malik.
Look, uh... I've got to talk to Helen about this thing with Dana. I'm just going to run in and see if she can get away for lunch.
Just hang a minute.
Nobody believes it can happen to them.
Same thing happened to me with wife two.  I had no idea until I came home and the house was empty.  I mean empty.  She even took the ice-cube trays from the fridge.  What kind of person would think of that?
Is this national security stuff boring you?
What're you talking about?  We have that.
Yeah, and we do it twenty times a day.  Don't give me that crap. Just put on the taps.  Now.
Now what?
I thought this look like your work.
--you tell the son of bitch this is  Bright Boy Alert.  Repeat, a Bright Boy Alert.  And I need a patch of the White House ASAP. That's right--
He's got it.
My husband is a good man.
God!  You have no idea how much that turns me on.  I've never had the courage to say this before but... I love you, Janice.
So your clients want something for the lobby of their new corporate headquarters?
Let's see... that you can read ancient Sanskrit without having to sound out the words.  And that other dealers and archeologists don't like you much.
How'd it go at the trade show? You make all the other salesmen jealous?
What did you tell him?
I need you to talk to Dana.  The vice principle called and she cut class again this afternoon.
Look, I know you're upset.  I'm really sorry, honey.  I raced home as quick--
Come on to bed, you don't have to brush your teeth.
Not because you were attracted to him?
Tell me about your husband, Mrs Tasker.
This Simon.  Did you sleep with him?
My husband can't know about this.
I can do it!
So last night was pretty exciting, huh?
What did he give you?
I don't take those assignments.
Tell me something before this stuff wears off and you start lying again.
As much as you used to?
Oh shit.
It's killer.  Look at me-- I'm not that much to look at.  No really.  I can be honest.  But I got 'em lining up, and not just skanks, either.  Some are.
Exactly.  The trick is, you gotta pick your target.  They have to be nice little housewife types. School-teachers.  But, I'm telling you, you get their pilot lit, these babes, they can suck- start a leaf-blower.
What does she do?
See.  You and this car were meant for each other.  Why fight it? Sure, I have a couple other buyers lined up, but I like your style.  Whattya say?  Should we start on the paperwork?
Yeeaoowww!!
Boris and Doris?
Look, Harry's not part of this. He's just a sales rep.
What's going on, Harry?
Now just keep your knees together, and you'll be fine.
Right, of course.  I was worried when I didn't hear from you that night.
You can call me Simon.  You're very brave to do this...  You opened it.
What do you want me to do?
Gotten your mail yet?
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
The letter I sent.
Has he looked through it yet?
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
Tell me about yourself.
Ask me them again. One by one.
Burt Reynolds.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
Did you hurt yourself?  Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
Yes.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
Is this a joke?
I think what you did...
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Shit! Nigger you smoke enough sherm your dumb ass'll do a lot a crazy ass things. So you won't eat pussy? Motherfucker, you be up there suckin' niggers'        dicks.
Naw naw!
Live with what?
Yeah.
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
What?
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
It's fuckin' real!  It's fuckin' real!
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Elliot what?
The zoo.
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
When he was alive. I wouldn't fuck him now.
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
Elliot.
No. Not yet.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
Go to the liquor store -  Where is there a liquor store around here?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Could we try it now?
That Vietnam movie?
Do you believe him?
He'll wear a wire?
But a fuckin' baggie.
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
Suspect's words -
He knows.
We gotta get him outta there.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
Preach on, Big D.
Well fuck you guys then! You guys are fucked up!
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Maybe you can help me. Actually, who I'm looking for is a friend of ours from Detroit. Clarence Worley? I heard he was in town. Might be travelling with a pretty girl named Alabama. Have you seen him? Are they stayin' here?
Well?
We want tough minded people.  Strong mentally.  We've had some...misfortunes with "unstable" types.
We're very close!  Because of you!
I told you that fuckhead Mason would get us into something like this.
Wow, a guy in a Chevy is chasing her and some other guy I can't see.
Let's consider again our current information -- if the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia on June 28, 1995, that makes us know that...?
To find out where the virus is so a qualified scientist can travel back into the past and study the original virus.
Mr. Cole?  My name is Doctor Railly. I'm a psychiatrist.  I work for the County -- I don't work for the police. My only concern is your well being -- do you understand that?
July.
What year do you think it is?
It was some lady.  She didn't know anything.
It's just a shot to calm you.
Did something terrible happen to you when you were a child?  Something so bad...?
You were in my dream just now.  Your hair was different, but I'm sure it was you.
About an airport...before everything happened.  It's the same dream I always have -- the only one.  I'm a little kid in it.
What do you mean -- when you were a kid?
Mason???
All I see are dead people.  Everywhere. What's three more?
What made you think that?
I want to be here.  In this time.  With you.  I want to become...become a whole person.  I want this to be the present. I want the future to be unknown.
You... you couldn't have heard me.
I have seen it, but I don't remember this part.  Funny, it's like what's happening to us, like the past.  The movie never changes -- it can't change -- but everytime you see it, it seems to be different because you're different -- you notice different things.
Does this bother you, Mr. Cole?
Who would you call, Mr. Cole, who would straighten everything out?
Why don't I escape, that's what you were going to ask me, right?  'Cause I'd be crazy to escape!  I'm all taken care of, see?  I've sent out word.
Never saw him before in my life.  Go ahead and shoot him or torture him or whatever it is you do.
Me?  Are you kiddin?  You're the one! You were a hero, man.  They gave you a pardon!  And whadda you do?  You come back and fuck with your teeth!  Wow!
The phone call, man.  The phone call.
What virus are we talking about, Dad?
Nine thirty
What?  What did you say?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
I think you'd better give your pooch a sip.  He looks sick.
You sure seen a lot for a blind man.
Maybe I do.
I think I've heard that before.
The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right.
I'll take a piece of that bet. I say it doesn't come up five times each side.
Hundred and eight ain't a hundred and thirteen.
A coin's got two sides.  When you flip it there's a fifty-fifty chance it'll be heads or tails.  Boyd thinks if you flip a coin ten times half the time it'll come up each side.
But, in particular?
We have a bus to Mexico.  Arrives in two hours.  Have to make a couple of connections, but it will get you across the border.
One way, or round trip?
I bought a beer.  That was two- fifty.  I bought a beer, otherwise I would have thirty.
You want somethin'?
Then why do you call it Harlin's?
That'll make five in a row.  Never seen it so hot.  Sometimes I don't even want to get out of bed.  I'd rather just lay there and try to catch a breeze.  I was in Mexico this one time--
It's your radiator hose.  It's busted.
Well, you know so much why don't you just fix it yourself?
What time is it now?
Nothing.
That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford?
It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money.
You think bad, and bad is what you get.
No!
Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch!
We're closed.  Come back in the morning.
I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business.
What was that all about?
You never said anything.  About the drapes.
Can I give you a hand, beautiful?
Jesus.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back.  Maybe they never would have found you.  Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
You've been around.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances.
What do you do anyway?
I think I can find my own way back to into town.
Did you ever?
He doesn't give it to us.  We take it.
Lied?  What do you mean?
It's not a combination lock.  It takes a key.  He keeps it on him all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Shit!
Why?  Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
Where's the safe?
John!?  What the hell's the matter with you?
I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep in the garage.  Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away.  Might buy us some time.
Had push it in.  Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
John . . .?
He was going to take the money.
The police don't know that.  And it's going to be hard to explain it to them with a noose around your neck.  I'll take you as far as California.  If we can even make that.  After that I'm cutting you loose.
Why?  So when the cops catch up with us you can try and sell me out again?  You take your hald of the money and run.  You might want to try Mexico.  With all that dough you'll live like a queen.
John!
It's . . . it's locked.
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
Who the hell are you?
You've got to be--
Live there?
I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
Good Lord.  What happened to you?
Another accident?  You've really got to be more careful.  Can I get you a drink?
Hungry?
Now what can I do for you?
You're the one who brought it up. This morning.  In your car.
Let's say I do want her dead.  What is it you want?  This morning you weren't a killer.
And for that you'd kill Grace?
You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you.
This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her.
You know what I mean.
Shut up.
You think that's a lot of money?
That's not the reason I'm here.  I swear it.
I came for Grace.
I came to kill her.
Then maybe this afternoon.  When I sent you to kill my wife you ended up sexing her instead.
Sense?  If I had any sense I would have killed you this morning and been done with it.
What are you babbling about?
Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter?
Got any requests?
Gee, that's sad.  Don't that make you sad?
You're not from around here, are you?  Where you from?
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is.
You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You're fucked.
They're not very imaginative?
I wasn't hitting on your girl!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm beating you up.
Mexico?  You're going to Mexico?
The old lady?
Do you understand me you little fuck?
Stay as long as you like, son.  No rush.
You bitch!  You were in on it froom the start!
Got any cold soda?
No police.
Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy?
Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop.
Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that?
What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself?
Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change?
Oh, Jesus.
What the hell are you keeping a dead dog around for?
I thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?
Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death . It's all the same to me.
Mister!
That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.
Now, what's this?
Who the hell is this!?
You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole!
I'm a solid man.
Hey!
She does at that.  I knew when I married her she was a free spirit.  A woman with her looks and a man my age; what was I to expect?  But you see a woman like that in a town like this and you don't think, you do. So, I married her.  What are you to do, eh? Women.
I've done a few things but I'm not a murderer, Mr. McKenna.
You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in.
Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money.
Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car.
Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her.
You meant it.
Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money.
How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! <u>You</u> want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional.
Next time you'll do just fine.
You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk.
How the hell did you know where the bedroom's at?
Two-hundred dollars?
You ain't from Oz.  Oz is in that movie.
If I could do you think I'd be standing here wasting my time.  Can you fix it, or do I have to go somewhere else?
Okay, I'm stuck.  You happy?  Now can you fix it, or not?
Accident.
I'm very interested in this but is there someplace...
Nothing.
Just banged my head.  It was an accident.
A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose?
Hey there.  I was beginnin' to think you wasn't comin' back...  You don't look so good.
Hell, I've had days I would gladly trade with a whippin' dog.  Ain't much you can do when you feel like that 'cept tough it out.
It's going to cost you two-hundred dollars.
The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation.
Got any cold soda?
It's very nice of you to help me.  That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Wasn't nothing.
Where you headed?
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man.
Where'd you learn to do that?
You flirt with me, then you run cold.  You lead me on, then slap me down.  I don't go for being jerked around.
You love him?
Did you ever?
I'm guessing no.
I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned.
I don't know how.
It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean <u>all the time</u>.  It scratches up against me when we do it.
Grace ... Grace?
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you <u>and</u> me.
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
Hope is a four-letter word.
Morning, officer.
Where ya goin'?
That's a shame, Bobby.  A real shame.
How about Ciudad Juarez? You could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in Albuquerque. It'll get you across the border.
Twenty-seven, fifty.  That's all I got.
What the hell you looking at, girl?
You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl!
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
I axed you a question.
Proceed.
Is that the entire message?
How old is Jeb?
I'm still going to New York. Just not this second.
Is Jeremy okay?
I don't know. It's been a while.
...I can't remember.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
Yeah? Megan where are you calling from?
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
I'm not sure.
How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?
What's he talking about?
Just give me a minute.
He's kind of a miracle.
Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom?
I think it's be better if I was alone.
You put too much. That's two hundred and fifty pounds.
I'm not scared.
Don't be scared.
You are in the emergency room of the University of Pennsylvania Hospital. You were in a serious accident.  How's your vision?
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this.  It works the quadriceps.
You and my mother would have a special connection.
No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
Well, go get it then.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
Billiards, eh? Even though I don't really wish to play?
He tell you where them others is?
Some big guy beat the shit out of me.  I guess I must look a lot like you, huh?
Oh. How long I been here?
Are you really going to kill them?
Hullo, Bob. Boys, this here is English Bob.
What I heard was that you fell off your horse drunk and broke your neck.
Shut up, Alice. Little Bill, a whippin' ain't gonna settle this.
Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
Heard you done the roof yourself.
An' all them cowboys been riding that beef down to Kansas an' Cheyenne?
All week?
They really got all that money, them whores?
Like I said, I...
I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
Duke.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.
"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."
Huh? Oh.  Another one, huh? Shit, I guess I'm clean out of receptacles.
What?
He's... he's dead.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
He hanged him?  Shot him down?
The questions Little Bill asked him... what sort of questions was they?
What'd Ned say?
Schofield? You from Schofield?
Oh.
Well, we was. Like you said, I changed my mind an'...
Well, now Kid, there's two of these cowboys, ain't that so? Better there's three of us... maybe them cowboys got friends. Maybe...
Well, what were you lookin' at anyhow?
Finish him, Ned.
Better re-load it.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
How long you gonna be, Bill?
Shit.
I brung this for when we had to kill them fellows.  I guess we could use some now.
No.
Well, I ain't like that no more, Ned. I ain't no crazy, killin' fool.
I'm goin' on down to Kansas.
Fuck you.
Say, Ned... ?
Well, I gotta know what kind of fellas I'm ridin' with, don't I? In case of a scrape.
I don't kill nobody without him. 
He's gonna die, ain't he?
Well, suppose he does?
I told you I'm a damn killer. I done it before.  I'm more killer than him.
I don't get it.
Who ?
A boy came across a body on the beach this morning. Thrown clear when the boat burned. Shot once in the head. Two guys from the F.B.I. just identified him.                     +
Not dope. Something else. Some what?.. He doesn't knob what they were buying. But not dope... people.
Don't give up on me now, Dean.
Come home, Dean.
Forget him. It's not important. I was trying to make a point.
I'm sure you can understand my hesitation.
It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
Why don't you just calm down'
You were waiting for a line-up then, too. What happened with that?
How do you do?
They - That's bullshit. They don't operate anymore.
I was out of line.
I'11 be alright.
No killing?
What is it Keaton?
What is this?
My employer wishes to remain anonymous.
No matter. Kill away, Mr. McManus.
What do you mean I can't see him?
He won't go into the interrogation room.
No, no, no, no, no.
That's crazy, Dave and it doesn't matter. He has total immunity and his story checks out. He doesn't know what you want to know.
Verbal, I know you know something. I know you're not telling us everything.
Sure. Fifteen years ago, but he was a good thief Anyway, the cops wouldn't let him go legit.
He wasn't behind anything. It was the lawyer.
You tell me, Agent Kujan. If I told you the Loch Ness Monster hired me to hit the harbor, what would you say?
That was how I ended up in a barber shop quartet in Skokie, Illinois.
You're stalling, Verbal.
Then what?
What call?
I WAS AFRAID, OKAY? Somehow, I was sure it was Keyser Soze at that point. I couldn't bring myself to raise my gun to him.
I don't buy that reform story for a minute. And even if I did, I certainly don't believe he would send you to protect her. So why?
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
My client offers his full cooperation in these proceedings. In exchange, his testimony is to be sealed and all matters incriminating to himself are to be rendered inadmissible.
Counselor, I will prosecute your client.
What did he find?
He was accused of jury tampering.
... here's your mail, call Mrs. Doneghy ...
You know what that would mean?  To get somebody from a Boston hospital to say he'll testify?
Say it.
You were the anesthesiologist at her delivery May twelfth, nineteen seventy...
It's a common medical expression, it's a crash program to restore the heartbeat.  Dr. Marx cut an airway in her trachea, to get her oxygen, her and the baby...Ms.Nevins...
Engaged to render an opinion.  For a price.  Is that correct?  You're being paid to be here today?
Yes, we've heard that.  Doctor: you testify quite a bit against other physicians?  Isn't that right? You, you're available for that? When you're paid to be there?
Mr. Concannon...?
No further questions.
Thank you, your Honor.  We object to the copy of the admissions form as incompetemt and essentially hearsay evidence and cite McGee versus State of Indiana, U.S. 131 point 2 and 216 through 25 of the Uniform Code:  'The admission of a duplicate document in preference to an existing original must presuppose the possibility of alteration and so must be disallowed.'  And, your Honor, having given the Plaintiff the leeway we would like your ruling on this issue now:  we object to the admission of the Xerox form.
The document is disallowed, the jury will be advised not to consider the testimony of Kathy Costello regarding the Xerox form.    It's unsubstantiated and we  can't accept a copy in preference to the original...
Then, please, which is correct? You've sworn today the patient ate one hour ago.  Four years ago you swore she ate nine hours ago? Which is the lie.  When were you lying?
That's not my handwriting.
And why, please tell us, would you think that?
You said you're gonna call me up. You didn't call me up.  Who do you think you are?    Who do you think you are...?
I am on the staff of...
I...given the limits of your question, that's correct.
I'm going to take you to the home to see the girl...
Dr. Thompson.  From your review of the hospital records of May twelfth nineteen seventy-six.  In your opinion, what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye?
Now, Dr. Towler's testified that they restored the heartbeat within three or four minutes.  In your opinion is his estimate correct?
And you wrote that...
Yes.
Yes.
Uh ... in the, well, in the interests of her family ... you, Dr. Gruber, you know, you can never tell what a jury is going to do. St. Catherine's a very well thought of institution.  Her doctors ...
We have to ... we ... we have to keep you under wraps.  Please don't, don't discuss ...
Who are you protecting, then?
Yessir.  I'm sorry.
...that's true.  Sometimes they change, sometimes they don't. Now, I remember back to when you were disbarred...
I had a witness disappear on me.
I could subpoena him if I had a week.
Do we have time this morning to... All right.  Mr. Galvin, you want to continue now, or we can resume with Dr. Thompson this afternoon.
Sustained.  Yes.  The witness will confine his testimony to review of the hospital records.
Yes, Mr. Galvin?
Listen to me, fella...
Mr. Galvin's...
Pardon?
Really.  How wonderful for you.
Jimmy!  That's why the court exists.  The court doesn't exist to give them justice, eh?  But to give them a chance at justice.
Why don't you get some rest?
You want me to tell you it's your fault?  It probably is.  What are you going to do about it?   I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
No, no, no.  I have to talk to him.  If I can only call him..
I have to talk to you.
Admittance form is wrong.
I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anaesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains...
'Mary Rooney, forty-nine.  Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.'  Can you get out tomorrow?  How come she isn't speaking up.
Okay now.  Cases:  Smith versus State of Michigan.
So what?
What I'm saying, they're getting some help.
That's right.
Who?  They're all testifying. Everybody who was in the O.R.'s going to take the stand.
...four years ago...
... I'm sure you do ...
... I understand ...
What does it mean?    I...I mean we, you have other tactics...
I just saw her.
Thank you.
Who told you that?
Kathy Price...
You were the Admitting Nurse at St. Catherine Laboure Hospital on May twelfth, nineteen seventy-six, the night Deborah Ann Kaye was admitted...
D'you ask the patient when did she last eat?
What did she say?
You have a record of what happened in the operating room...
...of the procedures...
...they start again three minutes earlier...
A huge law firm.  Okay?  They put him in the firm, he's married, everything's superb.  Franky, he's starting to talk like he comes from Dorsetshire, some fuckin' place, 'You must drop by with Pat and me...'  Okay...?
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
I didn't mean to be that rough.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
Yes.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Hello.
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
What do you want to know?
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
Where are you going?
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
What are you going to do?
Do you remember where you were?
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
One shouldn't live alone.
Oh! Yes. Hello.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
-- talking to you...
I hope we will, too.
Good-bye.
Do you know where you're going?
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Why?
Do you hear anything?
Where are you now?
Why did you jump?
I'm responsible for you now, you know.  The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
What else?
Where?
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Here with you.
Madeleine --
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Let me go into the church alone.
Oh, yes!
What do you mean?
I know. Everybody tells me.
And sit behind a desk?  Chairborne?
Well?... what'll you do?
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
Pop Leibel.
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Pop Leibel? Sure.
Out!
Midge!
Around.
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
Yes... the Beautiful Carlotta... the Sad Carlotta...
She died.
The stripper's here.
She's fucking hot!
Can't do what?
How ya doing?
We're leaving from my house in three hours. If you want to come, get your numbers in order by then.
It's really a stupid opinion. You have developed an annoying habit of talking for what seems to be no other reason than to hear yourself speak.
Tonight we return once again to the cave. Tonight we let the monsters out. We fill ourselves with the spirits of Genghis Khan, Joe Namath, JFK, Paton, Lombardi, Hemingway...
The floor was wet. She slipped!
Don't you threaten me you little rat fuck.
More.
Have you completely lost your mind? So you get her out of here. So you get her out into the desert somehow, without anybody seeing, so what, you don't think at some point somebody might notice that she's gone?
Wrap her up in blankets. Bring the car around to the back of the hotel, throw her off the balcony, put her in the car...Done.
Don't talk to me about character.
Fuck you Boyd!
Who? What are you talking about?
I won't calm down. I can't do this. We can't do this. It won't work. It will not work.
They're screaming for Starbursts.
We'll be ready Adam.
I won't do it.
Have you thought about what I said?
Micheal? Do you have something to tell me?
Who?
She's in there!
We need padded chairs.
Fuck! Fuck you fucking guys!
Fisher had a less than normal relationship with that Donkey.
Boyd...What have we done?
Regarding what?
I'm talking about Lois having relaxed her anxiety. Only deal is...you still got Micheal there?
That it was all an accident. She wants to hear it from Micheal's mouth.
My what?
Okay fine.
The hell I did!
Your ideas never work out.
I am a lover. In Africa, you can stay king as long as you can service your women every night.
If I'm the king of Israel, I say to myself, King, I say to myself, King... Take a good look around. What do I see?
I say to myself, look at the map. Look what's all around you. People who wish bad bad things for you and your people. For thousands of years the Jews are fighting everybody. It used to be they'd throw rocks, then the iron revolution and they would attack with spears. Then the gunpowder revolution. Now they're shooting fire power back and forth, all day bullets flying, babies getting shot.
Now if I'm the King of Israel and all these sand niggers are armed to the gills and you know it's just a matter of time ...right? Am I right?
The Mexicans would love it. They're dying for a little order down there. They need direction.
Oh that's just nothing. That's just a missing persons thing, that's all.
This is going to stop right now. Right now!
We're goosed! Goosed by God!
Why can't we do it through the mail?
The wedding cake check?
Stop it. I'm sorry.
Are we going to do this again?
I wouldn't know.
He's my friend. He's not a moron.
I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
That's absurd.
I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
Not padded ones.
You go down there.
Take care of those chairs.
Will you please call the chair people?
Hello.
What about the chairs?
You sound funny. Did you do cocaine?
What's the word on the chairs?
Don't we already have someone to do that for us?
It's okay...It's okay baby. Cry for Mama. Cry for Mama.
What kind of stupid question is that?
What are you talking about?
Who's dead?
Call the police.
My God. You've got to call the police, tell them it was an accident. Where is she?
I don't know. He could have told someone. He could have, like in the event of his death, somehow let someone know where those bodies are buried.
I could have done it better. I'm a fucking ball-buster I am.
Mike Brenn. Yes. Yes. 14.3 at 7.5 for 6. At 29.83 at 9.  I'm amazed the windows don't blow out of their fucking sockets with all the repressed, ass-puckering rage in these soul-less lizards.
I'm not breathing right.
Where did you get that?
Dad used to bring home these sparklers to me and Adam. Out back we'd light 'em up. The three of us. We'd hold 'em up to the sky and watch the explosions of light. Sparks. And dad would be all... "Get ready"..."watch for it"..."here it comes," here comes the "wahoo".
I appreciate it. I do, but...Maybe you ought to just ease up om yourself a bit.
No...No.
I told her that I have no idea what Adam was talking about in that letter.
Well that ought to be about the end of that.
We're just going to have the leader of the band sing alone with his guitar. Acoustic.
Fucking desert.
Shut up Micheal.
No, miss. Smoking makes him spit and feel ill.
Enedina and Paco ...
Which couch?
Take me there.
Did you have so little interest in seeing me?
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
Sometimes these things happen because of inexperience. Sometimes it's because of...
I should like you to do something for me. It's an innocent sort of thing but I'm very set on it.
Yes, I don't want you ever to leave this house.
Why don't you ask her to stay on for a few days?
The way she looked at me, Ramona! She hates me now. I think I've made a great mistake. She's going away, she's going away and nothing will stop her.
Don't lie. You don't believe me either.
It won't take but a minute. It's a votive offering for a lady who was cured just when she was dying of fever. Our Lady of the Helpless granted her a favor.
Not in that way; you're always looking for company.
So, Ramona!
How in hell does it wind up?
Me, rich? Come on!
I don't want you to untie me. Kill him and then I'll give you the money.
He was very good. Better than some people would think.
I don't know -- they've always been there.
Jorge, Don Jaime's son, at your service.
Are your parents alive?
Yes -- very, very big!
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
I'm sorry, I thought you were somebody else.
What are they doing in Los Feliz?
Why would they be going there?
You all right?
You were supposed to act as if everything was real.
You're wasting your time. I'm not going to play any more of your goddam games.
Jesus Christ.  Can you kill it?
Don't worry, they have no idea where you are.
There is no way Parker killed those guards. No way.
Ms. Deane, you wanted to see me?
What's the assignment?
Simulations are supposed to give participants practice in realistic, dangerous scenarios while protecting them from the risks they are exposed to in the real world.
It makes me nervous just seeing him in a uniform.  I will never forget the first time I saw the photos from the crime scene.
It's better than real. It's synthetic flesh. Synthetic blood. Synthetic organs...  It's a physiological machine.
How should I know?
If I don't adjust the level of neural information each side of his brain is receiving, he won't be able to walk when I take him out of VR.
All they want to produce around here is mediocrity!
It was you, wasn't it?
If I had died yesterday, you'd have already dissected my brain and analyzed it to see if I carry any genetic predisposition toward violence.
I need to know what snapped in you. What made you capable of it. You have to make me understand.
You all right?
Whoever did this wanted to do Charlie one better —— to improve upon what was already done.
This Lindenmeyer's a real piece of work.
The government must have figured there was no better person to create a psycho than a psycho.
Told you I wasn't going to go anywhere.
Why didn't you tell me you had a daughter?
She's beautiful, you know?
Want to tell me the real reason we stopped at your house?
Relax. I know what you meant.
Being on the street's a little different than sitting in an office all day, isn't it?
What's the problem?
Whatever he was doing here was only the start.
It's not just Sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. Stars need bigger and bigger audiences.  Whatever Sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.
The rally's a little obvious as a target, don't you think?
Nice work.
Find out anything?
That's why I'm asking.
Where's John?
There you go —— best seat in the house.
To the first LETAC engineer to go into production on prototypes.
Do they have to look so...robotic?
What if he's busy tonight?
Ames here.  <u>Yessir</u>...

I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.

THE CROWDS AT ANDREW'S AIRKORCE BASE, THE "OLD SHOE" BANNERS, THE "COURAGE, MOM," BANNERS.  THE STILL BAND.  A SHOT OF THE BANDMASTER, SURREPTITIOUSLY, GLANCING AT HIS WATCH.
We're due at Andrews.

Dartmouth
China.
How much...?
Do I know you?
What do you think would hold it off?
Here's the Short Course:  Fifty-Four, Forty or Fight. What does <u>that</u> mean?
It's like being a producer, Mr. Moss.  The Things in Trouble.  Somebody's got to wade in, save the thing.  You get the Actors get up there, and strut and <u>Posture</u>.  But somebody, knows what's what, got to jump in and Save the Thing. 
Who?
"They Got To Know?"  <u>Stan</u>...?  Get with it.  Who Killed Kennedy...?  I read the first draft of the Warren Report, said he was killed by a Drunk <u>Driver</u>.  You watched the Gulf War.  What did you see?  Day after day, the one "Smart Bomb" falling into a building. The <u>truth</u>, I was in the building when they <u>shot</u> that shot, they shot it in a studio, Falls Church Virginia, 1/10th scale model of a building.
How the fuck do <u>we</u> know.  You take my point?
"The Country Is At War." 
They got to have something that we want.
We've just got to hold their interest for ten more days, till the Election.
You can't have a war without an enemy.
What is it?
At the Airport?  Cause we decided at the Airport he hugs the fat, wet Albanian Broad, we...
What?
What're you gonna do with Morse Code?
Yeah...?
He can't respond to the Allegations.  I don't care <u>how</u> many girlscouts are picketing the ... look, look, look, we're coming home with <u>Gold</u>.  Eh? Tell him to hold firm for <u>two hours</u>... coming home with Gold.

What's the thing with Morse Code...
My prop guy, had a guy out here.
Mmm...
Against...who could be aggressor....Help me out here...Units of 303, the Defense Department confirms, early this morning, Albanian Time, stormed a mountain hideaway, near the city of -- help me out here -- and freed a tired, but happy William Schumann, Suffering no casualties.  His condition is reported as Guarded, and his route to the US has not been disclosed, but a high White House source confirms he is expected in Washington tomorrow morning...no, that's for the wire service.  Moss's working on Big Bird's Inaugural.  Nine A.M...?  Nine?  Miss the commuters, but...

Yup.
Who the hell's out there? What are the arbs saying? It's gotta be a big hitter.
Grand Marnier.
... That's what you told us to say.
...hey Chuckie, how's the woman- slayer?
So whaddaya say pal, wanna play some doubles at Piping? Meet the membership? I got a little blonde named Mandy, about nineteen, avec cafe au lait boobs... she's mine but she's got a cousin who has great muffins.
What the hell...
Hey the door was open.
Sell?
I told you not to go into that racket. You could've been a doctor or a lawyer,
you coulda stayed at Bluestar and been a supervisor in instead of going customer relations by now, 'stead of going off and bein' a salesman.
You get on the phone and ask strangers for their money, right? You're a salesman.
It's yourself you've got to be proud of, Huckleberry, how much ya need?
...same, pain in the ass, god bless her, talks too much... gonna take her to Florida next month... west coast, near Tampa, like to get out for good, but can't afford it.
What brings you out here...
Problem with money is you never have enough or you got too much -- and when you got it you're never happy 'cause somebody's always trying to take it away from you. Money's one giant pain in the ass y'ask me... thanks.
Dad, you know Duncan Wilmore, pilot's union, and Toni Carpenter, flight attendants...
Dad, I'm going to jail and you know it.
What if he asks where I got the money?
Didn't he tell you?  That's so like Gordon. Get dressed, we're going out.
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
Within 45 seconds, a microprocessor computes your systolic and diastolic pressure. Has an LCD readout, and it's cost effective -- less than one visit to the doctor.
So what firm you with, pal?
...A cosmetics company by any chance? What are you, the 12th man on the deal team? The last to know?
...don't like airlines, lousy unions...
My home number's on the back...
See this? Can you believe it? Two inch screen...
Mr. Gekko -- thank you for the chance. You won't regret this, you're with a winner.
I guess your father's not a union representative on that company.
Know the name?
Revenge is a dish best served cold... well, it's payback time, sport.  ... see that building? I bought into it ten years ago. It was my first real estate deal. I sold it a couple of years later and made an $800,000 dollar profit. It was better than sex. At that time I thought that was all tne money in the world...  Now, it's a day's pay ... I had a mole in Wildman's employ. Gave me half the picture, then he got fired...
I'll be right there, fix them a drink.
The break up value is higher. It's worth 80.
Gordon what I want--and I never asked you for anything--is to be your co-pilot on this. I want to take this airline, turn it around, and make it work. It's gonna make us a fortune!
I can talk to these people Gordon, they trust me...and my father can be a big help in getting cuts.
What the hell do you want?
Hello Bud.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this,  you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although...  I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
I love you, baby. Did I tell you that sometime in the last 24 hours?
How you doing Buddy?
Bud! Where you been the last two days?
Mr. Mannheim, got a sure thing.  Anacott Steel.
Sorry to hear that. I thought the kid had staying power.
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
Yeah, Billy, who's your buyer?... No, not interested.  Ollie, start calling a the institutions, start with Marx at Janson Mutual, then Reardon. Get me that California retirement money, baby! And we're on our way!
Listen, you clowns, there's somebody else out there trying to buy your airline, if you want to be Pac-manned and gobbled by Atilla the Hun be my guest!
He still likes you
He did?
What's that?
Anybody want another drink?
Us is over.  You had your chance you blew it.
Your books Master Loftmore
She went to a waxwork party
Wooo.  Jealously rearing its ugly head.
No, no James, it's not like that.  Tony and China, they're just friends.
If my mother caught me up here she'd kill me.
I can't believe she went out with that monster last night
No thank you sir we're fine.
If you sold your soul to the devil, you'd never age either
Of course you will.
He loves you very much.  He just--
Pretty.  She's a blond.
Are you humoring me?
You're saying you willed these events to happen?
Me?  No.  Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
How're you holding up?
Norman was telling me the dream house is finally finished.
I'm sorry?
Toward the end.  You remember?
Oh-kay...
That's not...It's not like that.
Love.
Why are you here?
They're calling me in to work.
Wow.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
And I kicked ass.  My best stuff.  Then I stood in the hallway and listened to her audition...and I cried.
Oh my god.  You bought it.
Absolutely.
Telling you...
Place your fingers on the planchette.
Something was there.  You saw it.
And he's the real thing.  Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Adamant?
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
Jody, she tried to kill him.
Alright.  I can't take the rejection.  I'm going to class.
It's today?
Whatcha reading?
You did a great job.  She's a good kid.
Tired?
Maybe we should just...
Why?
...when tonight they'll probably be keeping us awake.
What are you doing here?
Think I may have cracked it.
And he says...you'll fucking love this, he says, "Doctor Spencer, I am a great admirer of your work..."
He killed her.
He did.  She's in the picture.  I went over to look and she's gone.  The table was set for one.
When?
What are you doing?
I never said...
Who did?
Sabotage?
Maybe you're right.  Maybe I'm losing my mind...
You dropped a glass.
You shoved me away and ran out to the patio.  I took you home.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
I don't like this, this...
I think she's starting to suspect something.
I never asked you to quit!
She was damaged and unstable.  The more I tried to distance myself, the more desperate she became.  Finally, she showed up at the new house...
Look for antiques...
Adamant.
:Would you stop it!
You've always said you felt goodness in them - that the witches brought you and Rowan together.  Isn't that right...?  They're reaching out to you, Rowan!
I - r saw him as a child.  Lots of times...  But no one else did.
'The heir to the fortune must wear the Mayfair pendant an her wedding day.'  We should all have to suffer such burdens.
I beg your par---
My...mother...?
But my mother...  Ellie said she died -
You can see well in the dark, Rowan.
Lasher touched you and you loved it.
...and why I put thirty years between you and the beautiful monster. To kill the legacy!    you are the sum of his desires -
Michael...  Do what you can.
Lasher - bring us through!
Parents say he - uh - fell -
- and he seemed okay.  Just banged his -
STOP!
I'm going to have a baby.   Michael wants to name it after you - if it's a girl.  Diedre Mayfair Curry. Pretty, huh...?  Funny --- I never really thought I'd ever ---
If that were true, I would not be here.
you crave what I might show you.  What you can learn.  What I can give you.  So much more than Michael can.
But I could understand. I want to understand!
You mustn't hurt him. Mustn't - mustn't hurt..
Only you...
What is wrong...?
No!
Aaron was in the dream.  A dream tilled with spirits.   you killed him, didn't you...?
Rowan and I will be together now. My time has come.  Your time is gone.
I've read the stories - and seen the news coverage.
You know - doors and keyholes are common signposts in out-of-body -
HARDER!
Oh. The Green underwater Ghost's...  The Man With The Eyes In His Hands...
I'm serious.  You don't -
Rowan...?
Everyone - this is Michael curry.
Either do I.    I love you, Ro.  You know that. You're a total mystery to me - but I love YOU. 
Smoking is bad for your heart, Michael.
Dovetails.  Gotta be a hundred years old.
Go home, Stu  I'll call you.
Wow...
A few hours and I'll be wasting away in Margaritaville.  Oh, sweet decadance.
Rowan Mayfair.
I thought you were almost engaged, Stu...?
I thought it was 'whistle while you work.
We'd better get to work on the papers.
Which do you think is her best shot...
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
And it can't be forged?
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
This must be one of the old keys -
Oh - Tell me ELLEN, I can call you ELLEN?
Oh anywhere - whenever I needed to - Do you know how easy it is to take them? You just pick up a hiker, or someone off the streets - they believe so easily you know, 'Look, I have something to show you' I would say - and that would be it. One girl, I think her name is Debbie - she had broken down on the motorway, and I offered to take her to a service station to call for a tow truck - She just got in and I drove away. When I pulled into the layby and took out my knife - she just froze, and said - what do you want? - I said, You know what I want. - But she didn't. Getting rid of the bodies is just as easy - the first I cut up, put in bags with bricks in, and tossed them off Eldridge Bridge in broad daylight.  The real problem with my work is the blood - there is so much of it - and it all spurts out so fast - like a fountain. It made such a mess of
What did you do with her?
How long have you been watching me?
then why did you marry her -
You are the first person I have ever told any of this to. We are birds of a feather ELLEN...we're in the same league
You think I killed my MOTHER don't you?
No...I didn't do it...I wish I had but I didn't. I was beaten to it. STEPHANIE became my mother.
What?
Yes...
But ELLEN, I told you I have stopped...
ELLEN, would you like a cup - there's plenty in the pot
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
What's wrong with you?
You don't own him you know - you can't tell me not to see him!
Is LESLIE here?
As it happens, I was at home alone - maybe we could solve each others problems?
That's good
Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism.
This is the life, baby. We get ourselves some tail and we're talking SPRING BREAK!
You kiss your mother with that mouth?
A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen.
You'll never believe who's in there.
Holy stinkers, what were you thinking?
Naked girls, wild sex, video games. No wonder it's called "Heaven."
Never say never.
If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor.
Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism.
Wouldn't it be awesome if we were about to say the exact same thing?
Well. The prom's coming up.
And I was wondering.
Teddy? Would you please please please take me to the prom?
Oh, Ted, DUH.  I smile at everyone since I got my braces off.
You really don't get it, do you? I am genetically programmed to desire a big, buff, manly man who can defend and provide for me and my yet to be conceived offspring! It's, like, a caveman thing!
I thought I'd be nervous, but you sure know how to make a girl feel relaxed, Teddy Bear.
I was always too shy to admit how much I liked you.
God, you are so hot.
We have a truckload of strawberries arriving on Tuesday morning.
We're not ashamed of you, Teddy. We don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so-called "flesh parties" you attend. But we can get past all that.
I remember spring break of my senior year.  Seems like a lifetime ago.
Grandpa was so strong back then. Working from the crack of dawn. So proud of his peaches.
Son.
Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood.
Whatever helps you cope.
Ted, it's your dad.  I have a question for you.  I don't know how to put it tactfully. You know I'm lousy with words.
But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true.
Hey, Ted. Wanna go shopping?
Don't worry.  He found the chocolate room.
Or do you have a taste for the good life, Ted? It's in your blood.
After graduation...maybe we could go away together?
Ted! Do something!
They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much.
And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me.
Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty."
Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know?
Mom and Dad said it's yours. They seem to think you're coming home.
You're a peach.
But just for the record, my Mom is a kick-ass schoolteacher and my Dad is the best damn auto mechanic this side of the Himalayas. You seem to have forgotten they opened Nelson's FAMILY Market so they could build something permanent, a legacy, for us. Their kids.
Great.
I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds.
What is it, William Randolph? Your balls need scratching?
In what sense?
I'm still better than you. Nothing changed except the decimal point in your savings account.
I don't get the distinction.
I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating.
She said peanuts, you cretin.
Funny you should say "peachy."
Considering this is your first time on a private jet, on which you are interviewing the world's most eligible bachelor,  you are extremely cavalier.
Why can't you be nice to me?
Wow...you clean up nice.
I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction.
Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you.
A good journalist can take lemons and make lemonade. I'm honing my craft.
That has more to do with your proximity to me.
Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing.
My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs.
A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo."
I mean your pictorial. It bothers me, profoundly.
I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know.
Well? Surprised?
Oh, good lord. Are those Neptunes?
Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me?
I need your help.  I'm really in deep shit.
I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
Come on, it's our only senior prom.
I'm warning you.
You do like girls, don't you?
A lot? I mean, a whole lot?
Ah, in other words, this is the apres-orgy salon?
Truth is, I'm a little nervous.
All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure.
I do?
You're the Sultan of Semen. The Monarch of Masturbation. The Merchant Prince of Lust. You. Ted. Are the King of Coitus.
Well...for one thing...I think it's despicable that we exclude so many women that only fit our western notion of "classic beauty."
The world is a big, beautiful place.  We can open new markets in Africa and Asia.  Imagine the Dali Lhama reading our magazine.
So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential.
Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you?
Yes?
Thanks for teaching me an important lesson. What makes a family is love, not blood.
You've got the wrong guy. The closest my parents have been to the Amazon is the Brazilian pavilion at Epcot.
How quaint.
All I can tell you Sam, is hang in there.  They clear you of this mess, you get reinstated, with back pay...
Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?
She's going to wash your Jeep?
Ray.  Stop calling.  I told you the dental records will take time...
Wasn't enough Van Ryan had to destroy the people who invested here.  He got to be old, he and his rich cronies would come down here, hunt and whore, act like assholes.  One trip he showed up with this young girl he'd picked up somewhere, gotten her pregnant then dumped her in the swamp.  That came with her.
They were in me.  Both places... you know.
Then what?
How long?
Maybe she used another name.
I've got that two o'clock in town.
It's our job, Gloria.
You can go up to one of those trees and peel the bark.  You know what you get? More bark.  And more bark.  There's no core.  Tree's not good tar anything but sucking up water.  And now they can't get rid of them.  They've tried poisons. Nothing works.  They don't die.
You remember that little girl walked out of our talk at Blue Bay?
Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial.  Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?  So why not tell us about the affair?  I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
Which she might have saved, if she hadn't set out to destroy the man's life.
It's starting, Gloria.  This is how it begins...
I'm gonna take you back to the office. Will you put out a call on Suzie's car for me?
If you want company...
Two kids could've gotten into a fight, lost a couple of teeth.
Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
I'm tired, Ray.  I'm going home.
About a year ago.
No.
I want a full-scale investigation.
Or maybe she thought that was what she wanted and she got a little more than she bargained for...
Ray.  The conversation on this tape is totally unintelligible.  What we have here, is you on the Van Ryan property, without a proper warrant, shooting a porn flick...
I told her I was coming with her.  She nodded, like she understood.  We stood up together.
He pushed into me... I couldn't stop him... it hurt.
Ms. Toller?
Come on.  Beats study hall, doesn't it?
Way I hear it, he was pretty tight with the kids, one of the guys...
Will you calm down.  Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain?
Is that Sam Lombardo?
Which one of your "bodyguards" is that?
Kelly.  What is it?
Don't bother.  I'm taking a trip.
All right.  I'll have to look for it.
Shit.  I was afraid of that.  She left this garbled message on my machine.  Can you calm her down?
I'm running away.
Yeah, they're bad for your health.  I'm tryin' to look out for you...
Well, you're half right.  Best thing you could do for yourself right now would be to talk to me.
Every triangle I've ever seen never lasts.  Somebody's got to go.
You, Kelly, Sam.
You... I should've killed you myself. should never have left it up to him...
Yes.
But you do admit to touching her, to putting your arm around her.  Isn't that against the rules?
Yeah, well, you fixed that.  What the hell happened, anyway?
You mean this thing?
But I..
Yeah, right.
But then you knew what he was like all along... Maybe his killing Kelly was a thing you had counted on...
Why don't you come in, have a drink?
Sorry, Sandy.  I've got plans.
Grab a clue, Sam.  You're a hired hand around here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.
Attractive buttons, yes?  But yank one off, toss it, and poof!  It emits a cloud of sleeping gas.
Good Lord, man.  The world is changing.  And mark me, it is always the criminal mind that is the first to exploit modern invention.  We, as defenders of the right, must keep pace!
Yes, aha.  A brass screw.
Doyle, once around the park.  I need a moment to prepare.
Doctor V. L. Pemberton.  I knew it.  He's a scientist all right. Inventor of the Pemberton Condensed Steam Engine.  I'm telling you, Artemus, Loveless is our man.
All that jumping and kicking.
Damn it, this is ridiculous.
Jim, are you all right?
Well... that, too.
So... what happened?
You might have mentioned you had that.
Strange... you'd think he'd have this place better guarded.
No record of him.
What's this?
So the idea is if a guy punches me, he really hurts his hand?
When we find him, he is mine.
Artemus, you ready for this?  His next target is Albuquerque.
I know!  I know!
We've got to stop him right here, now!  With that armored steam engine of his it'll be a slaughter.
It was in your book.
Are those just button buttons or...?
Artemus!  Look at that.  Brand spanking new.  She's a beauty, huh?  Let's get rolling.
Time for you to get off, Ma'am.
You know, ma'am, you remind me of a pearl-handled pistol I once owned. A beautiful thing to look at, but too hot to handle.
Oh, don't worry.  I've already overlooked the fact your name's not actually on our guest list.
Have you taken a wrong turn, Mr. Tyler?
You've... done... this... before.
You know, I really hate being toyed with before someone shoots me.
Look, I'm Captain James West...
Why surely, Mr. President, there must be some mistake.  I mean...
Mr. President, good to see you again, sir.  Sorry about all that.
... well, of course you can.  Mr. President, what a surprise.  What brings you here?
Why don't we just cut this routine short?  Whatever you do to us, we're not going to talk.
... And do give me some room, Voltaire.  You're breathing on my head!  I hate it when you breath on my head!
These lands were taken by force from Mexico in the illegal War of American Aggression.
A Southern gentlemen.  I don't recall his name.  I suppose it's unkind of me to say it, but he had the most disconcerting glass eye.
This is something.
I beg your pardon?
Well?
Well, come on, that's half a dozen armed men...
We're going into battle, little one.  Find a woman to take care of it.
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
You are very important, Willow.
They look like acorns.
You!  Are you the mother of that child?
I can't.
I do what I'm told.
Because it's true.
Please?  I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Thanks for your help, Peck.
You all right?
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
You gotta promise to feed her.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold.  And keep her diaper changed.
You!!
Because she's sick.
She's in love.
Watch it!
I have an idea.  Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
I don't know, Willow.
Can't we keep it, Dada?
Dada, what's a daikini?
Who are you!  Who are you!
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
I'm not going in there.
We gotta follow them.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
I'm getting her out of there!
Hey, careful there!
Obviously.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Your hole is healed, then?
Everything is all right, John.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
Hey, Sam...
Don't let them hurt you.
What have you got?
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
What's your first move?
Who else knows?
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
You have no right to keep us here.
What was that?
Now what's the problem?
Oh? Anything else?
Who are they?
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Enjoying your reading?
What else can you do?
Sure.
You're so sure of that?
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
I want you to take this... to remember by.
Anybody know about this?
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
I'm coming.
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
You admit you're lying?
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.  Tell me what you know...
What's so funny?
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
You're Rachel Lapp, aren't you?
Get back in there.
Aunt Em!
Seventy --  Dorothy, please!
Dorothy!
-- no place like home -- there's no place like home -- no place --
But I did leave you, Uncle Henry -- that's just the trouble.  And I tried to get back for days and days.
Yes.
Uhh -- yeah --
Well, Dorothy was walking along the --
All right, Mrs. Gale.  But some day they're going to erect a statue to me in this town, and --
As Mayor of the Munchkin City In the County of the Land of Oz I welcome you most regally
Then this is a day of Independence For all the Munchkins and their descendants!
Our echo.
Uhhhh -- yes...
Yes-s-s -- that...that's exactly so.  I'm a humbug!
Frightened?  You are talking to a man who has laughed in the face of death -- sneered at doom and chuckled at catastrophe.  I was petrified.  Then suddenly the wind changed, and the balloon floated down into the heart of this noble city, where I was instantly acclaimed Oz, the First Wizard de Luxe!
Now look, here's something that really has a heart. This is the best invention I ever invented.
Who did it? Now wait a minute.
What are you going to do with my dog?  Give him back to me!
No!  No -- no!  Here -- you can have your old slippers -- but give me back Toto.
I thought you said she was dead.
Pooh -- what a smell of sulphur!  I'm afraid you've made rather a bad enemy of the Wicked Witch of the West.  The sooner you get out of Oz altogether, the safer you'll sleep, my dear.
No -- that's true. The only person who might know would be the great and wonderful Wizard of Oz himself!
Oh, now?
And think to yourself -- "There's no place like home; there's no place like home; there's no place like home."
Oh --
Where do you want to be oiled first?
Oh --
...and right in the middle of a chop, I...I rusted solid.  And I've been that way ever since.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, are you all right?
We might.
Oh, he's just ascared again.
Oh, my!
Yes -- let's run!
Oh, but -- but please. It's very important.
Your Majesty, if you were king You wouldn't be afraid of anything?
How about a hippopotamus?
I'd be too scared to ask him for it.
Does it work?
Oh -- Oh -- Oh!  Toto -- Toto!
Oh, now I'll never get home!
Why, Zeke, -- you're just as scared as I am!
Down?  No, you see, I'm -- Well, -- I'm --
...yes.
...free!
Did I scare you?
I don't blame you for that.
Oh, dear -- I keep forgetting I'm not in Kansas.
Oh, you're the best friends anybody ever had!  And it's funny, but I feel as if I've known you all the time.  But I couldn't have, could I?
No -- No -- No -- No!
Who killed my sister?  Who killed the Witch of the East? Was it you? Answer me!
Come on -- I've got another idea.
Dorothy!
Not even a rhinoceros?
There. Now, that's the best we can do without any pins.
...I -- I -- I hope my strength holds out.
You don't get around us that easy!
... about Dorothy.
That's right.
Then I'm sure to get a brain --
Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch!  This is a spell, this is!
Oh, I think I see a jijik And he's fuzzy and he's furry I haven't got a brain But I think I ought to worry!
Who do you suppose they were? And where did they take her? A fine thing - to go to pieces at a time like this!
Yeah --
Oh - upstairs, quickly!
-- And the courage that you promised Cowardly Lion?
Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Universitatus Committeeatum e plurbis unum, I hereby confer upon you the honorary degree of Th.D.
-- Ruined my exit!
What happened to Len Tashka?
Shame you had to spot I wasn’t the real thing.
What the hell were you doing?  You nearly killed us!
Nuclear.
Is there another way?
He’s sealed himself in.
Count to twenty.  When you get to twenty open the hatch.  It can only be opened for a few seconds or we’ll sink.
Dislocated collar bone.  If any more tendons snap...  It won’t just be two weeks out of action.
He survived?
Now Robert is dead. He got his revenge.
Get out to the pipeline. Find the insider who switched the pin. If your instincts are right, Renard will be back. He hasn’t completed the job. The pipeline is still going forward, and we have Elektra to thank for that.
Your last chance. Take the money.
Revenge isn’t so hard to fathom. What’s clever is getting someone else to pay for it.
She’ll get over it.
I haven’t been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now.
Does this look familiar to you?
Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women?
I think running this pipeline would be a difficult job for anyone. Especially King’s daughter.
I can’t stay.
Vodka martini.
What the hell are you doing here?
If this little show is for my benefit, I’ll take you home right now.
Surely you believe in living dangerously.
Since I was a child, I’ve always had a power over men. When I realized my father wouldn’t rescue me from the kidnappers, I knew I had to form a new alliance.
One... last... screw?
What are doing, Bond?  Trying to impress this innocent thing?
Now...where were we?
This is too big for even you.  Where is it?
Mother of God.
In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo.
Now you know how it feels.  To be locked away, to wonder if they’re coming for you, if anyone will ever come for you.
Everything’s under control up here.  Are you ready?
We’ve been pawns in someone’s game. They tricked us into bringing the money to King. Not just elaborate.  Cock-sure.
Do we have the range of Renard’s plane?
Any word from him?
Major Adamson, I can't seem to get in the door.
We don't really know, sir, but bluntly, our survival capability . . . may depend on a quirk of the weather.
No idea who's behind this?
Walter --
And what -- split -- the dog's skull open?
That man, then, he was the first.  The first you --
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VEIDT?
Blake?  Dead?
Jon --
Sorry, it's this thing with Blake.  I mean, you don't really think anyone's out to get us -- do you?
Hey.  You remember that nut in the hockey mask?  With the asthma? What was his name . . .
Christ yes, I went in for a cancer scan first thing.  Gave me a couple of rough nights, I'll tell you . . .  How about you, Laurie?
Laurie, wait.  I've got a spare room.  It's empty.  If you'd like . . . LAURIE Oh Daniel, thanks, but I couldn't.  You'd just be all nervous about --
I just realized.  I'd never seen his face.  I guess it was just a matter of time.  He's totally -- Daniel? What's wrong?
Ohh.  I could use some dinner.  Who was that on the phone?
-- What is it.
The Owlship.  I can't believe it.
Adrian's headed down to his secret retreat.  He invited us to come along.  I've been thinking.  If things do get nasty . . . it wouldn't be a bad place to sit out a war.
God, you sound like Jon.  -- Turn around.
They're practically on us . . .
What?
No offense, Laurie, but it was Silk Spectre I had the crush on.  Tonight was the first time I've felt like myself in ten years.
Welcome back, Night Owl.
Hiya, pardner.  Long time no see.
What new information?
How do we know they've got cancer?  Could be part of massive propaganda scheme . . .
Sorry, Daniel.  You've always been a good friend.  I know that.  Sorry about Laurie.
What happened?
What caused it?
Adrian.  What are you doing?  Why wouldn't you let us in?
I did not.  Now get out of my way!
Six to eight months.  That's with treatment.  -- Perhaps now you can see why it's so vital that we locate your . . . friends.
All right, Miss Juspeczyk.  Pack your things.
Oh, I am, honey.  You see, Russian tanks are crossing the Afghan border this very minute.  And we are all of us, every living soul, in deep, deep shit -- because our number-one strategic weapons has finally flipped out.
Rorschach, you're talkin' heavy duty stuff.  I got nothing to do with --
Two things I hate.  Street mimes . . . users of recreational drugs.
What is this place?
Whether you thought this was for real or not, you jumped in and helped the waitress on instinct. That tells me something about your character.
Sure as gravity. I've had a feeling about you from the start, Cage. It's nausea.
What do I get out of it?
I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports.
I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars.
You did say "Ahab"? You're sure about that?
Thought you bought the farm down there, X. Glad as hell to see you.
All for show. Just a psychological mind game to get you to do the right thing.
What do you have?
He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost.
Whatchu doing here?
Do they have any special powers? The bosses always have special powers.
Nothing, really. My guy is just doing it to stay alive.
Do you know what a wire transfer is?
I don't know what you're talking about.
So why don't you tell me something about who you gather information for. They obviously have very deep pockets. Are you from a rival clan?
A beach named X? That I'd like to see.
Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people.
You're what? What the hell have you been doing?
What are you doing with the Ivans?
Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent?
Yorgi and Kirill.
Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
I can see that. Why?
I'm having fun, what's the problem?
It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability.
What...?
My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you.
I'll leave you two alone to talk.
Sorry, "dude".
Oh come on, don't feel bad. You got played, so what? You're new at this. Did you think you could just stroll into this business one day and have all the angles figured out?
Heads up, man. What's this thing on my back?
Who's writing this dude's dialogue?
Help me with this guy.
They're all over the place! What the hell's going on?
Don't look at me, X, she handles all the details.
Very nice. I'm impressed.
I had to inspect the merchandise first.
It's all this craziness! It's what we've been living since 99, when we left the Army. One of our brothers died in Grozny and we said the hell with this shit. What for? He dies for what? Politics? Who's politics? Not ours.
To us it means no walls, no speed limits, no jails. It's everybody does what he wants. People think democracy is freedom but they don't have a clue. There's an old punk song. It says: "America stands for freedom, but if you think you're free..."
I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg.
I've got meetings this afternoon, I've got to get some sleep. Just pick a girl.
That was for Anders.
What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
And here I thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt.
You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
What does that mean?
I wish I could go.
Can the Professor repair his own mind?
Correct...  Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces.  He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator.  And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
What's wrong with him?
Hey.  I'm sorry.  About Logan.  I was jealous.
I'll tell you one thing though.
Radar Stealth Mode checks out.  All right, there'll be less security north of the George Washington Bridge.  I'm taking her down.
Anything else I can get you?
I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --
The point of what?
Now that's Magneto talking.
You designed this yourself?
He helped you?
Don't you knock?
Why?  You have a home here now, if you want it.  Everyone will...
Why is everybody up at sunrise?
I lost him.
I am trying to save our kind, Charles. You should do the same.
The two in Alaska.  Just how do you people manage to be in the right place at the right time?  Still tinkering with Cerebro?
And who might you be?
They say, also, that you have recreated the horrible monster who, for so many years, has haunted and terrorized the God-fearing people of this village.  What say you to that?
Didn't you prepare it with the celery before my lecture?
No, sir.  It will never happen again.
Yes, sir, he was.  But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
What?
You're incorrigible!... Aren't you?
Did you see?...I put a special hamper in the bathroom just for your shirts.  the other one is just for socks and poo-poo undies.
And your passport?
Will you miss me?
I will!  Goodbye, darling!
Ready, darling?
Oh, Delbruck, Delbruck.  Was will dien tachlas von Dir?
I suppose you're right.
well, there was a public and a private library -- he said so in his will.  these books are all very general -- any doctor might have them in his study.
Surely he kept his notes -- his private papers and records in some other place?
Well... we'll see.
What are you waiting around for, pickle puss?
How long will this whole thing take?
No, it's Dr. Fronkonsteen!
Yes, but, sir... if it could be accomplished, wouldn't that eliminate disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death?
Yes, that's right.  My grandfather and your grandfather used to pal around together.  You and I should have a lot of laughs.
Did you hear that strange music??
It seems that way.  You didn't hear any music at all?
It is!  This was my grandfather's private library.  Look at this!
The ancient masters promised impossibilities and performed nothing.  We shall penetrate into the recesses of nature.  We shall ascend into the Heavens.  We shall command the thunders of Heaven, mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows.
It's trying to talk.  it wants us to take off the straps.
Whew!  I'm glad that's over with.
Yes.
How's it going?
Bring -- me -- the -- violin!
What monster?
... and equalize the imbalance in his cerebrospinal fluid...
Come on, big fellow!
I'm going to untie you -- can you understand that?
Poo -- tmmm anngh ma Ritz!
MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmm.
May I see your violin?
Are you busy?
Listen!  Don't you hear that strange music?
Look, Doctor!
Oh, Doctor!
It has a pas-sion, 'The Con-ti nen-tal...'
Good night, Doctor.
I think the doctor is a genius! Don't you, Igor?
What d'ya want to do to kill time?

Drink!
GRRRHMMNNNJKJMMMNN!
Will we be fighting the Zulus soo~, Quartermaster? .
You afeared of the Zulus then, Quartermaster?
Why don 't the Zulus attack?
An historical moment, Gentlemen.
Splendid horsemanship  Who are they?
The only reports of enemy activity have come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.
How quickly can you move your artillery forward?
Colonel Durnford... William Vereker. I hear you 've been seeking Officers?
