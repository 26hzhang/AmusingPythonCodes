The codes are from tensorflow github page: [word2vec_basic.py](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/word2vec/word2vec_basic.py). It helps to understand the theory of word2vec as well as learn to use tensorflow to build your own program.

Codes are reconstructed to make it more flexible and readable.
