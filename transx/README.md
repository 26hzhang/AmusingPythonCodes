This repository is converted from [thunlp/TensorFlow-TransX](https://github.com/thunlp/TensorFlow-TransX), which is a light and simple version of OpenKE based on TensorFlow, including TransE, TransH, TransR and TransD. TransX methods are used for knowledge representation learning (KRL), which encode information of relational knowledge into vectors and expand its usage into many different fields.

This repository is just a practice codes after reading several KRL related papers to help understand the process better. For more details and information on this field, please refer: [Natural Language Processing Lab at Tsinghua University -- GitHub page](https://github.com/thunlp).

Dataset can be download from [[here]](https://github.com/thunlp/TensorFlow-TransX/tree/master/data).

In this repository, the codes structure is different from the original one, some modifications and adjustments are made to let the codes more understandable and easily to use.

**TransH Training Example**:
```bash
Input Files Path : ./data/FB15K/
